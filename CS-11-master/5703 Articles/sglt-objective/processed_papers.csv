New Diabetes Therapies and Diabetic Kidney Disease Progression: the Role of SGLT-2 Inhibitors,"IntroductionThe worldwide prevalence of diabetes mellitus will continue to increase in the next decades from 415 million people in 2015 to 642 million in 2040 [1]. Approximately 40% of all patients with diabetes will develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and a substantial number of these patients will progress to end-stage renal disease [2]. Diabetic kidney disease is also independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and a significant reduction in life expectancy [2, 3]. Consequently, it places a heavy burden on individual patients and on national health budgets. Recent studies indicate that the 10-year mortality rates of patients with DKD equal average mortality rates of all cancers [4, 5]. There is thus a strong rationale to develop new interventions to slow the progression of DKD.Current treatments to prevent or delay kidney (as well as cardiovascular) complications in patients with diabetes focus on lowering blood pressure, HbA1c, body weight, albuminuria, and cholesterol. Targeting these multiple risk factors reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and kidney function decline [6, 7]. Nevertheless, many patients do not reach their target blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and/or lipid levels.Recently, several strategies have been tested to improve the prognosis of patients with diabetes. One of these strategies was to examine the effects of intensive compared with conventional glucose control on cardiovascular complications. Several large clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes showed that aggressive glucose lowering did not result in a reduced risk for macrovascular complications [8, 9]. The ACCORD trial even showed that intensive glucose lowering increased mortality rates compared with conventional glucose control [10]. These findings, in combination with initial concerns about the safety of rosiglitazone, led the FDA to mandate that the cardiovascular safety of all new glucose-lowering drugs must be investigated in post-marketing clinical outcome trials. As a result, many large cardiovascular outcome trials have been completed the last few years or are ongoing. These trials are designed to demonstrate cardiovascular safety and are powered to show non-inferiority compared with control treatment. They have provided important insight in the efficacy and safety of various glucose-lowering drug classes which would likely have been unknown if the FDA mandate had not been in place. The first cardiovascular outcome trials tested the effects of dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DDP-4) inhibitors and demonstrated that these agents have largely neutral effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes [11–13]. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) appeared to have a favorable cardiovascular safety profile and two of them, liraglutide and semaglutide, reduce both cardiovascular risk and albuminuria progression [14–17]. All these trials enrolled patients at high cardiovascular risk. Whether these agents slow progression of kidney function decline could not be appropriately established since on average the enrolled population was at low risk of kidney function loss. Two trials with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors showed surprising and unexpected beneficial effects. In fact, after the neutral DPP-4 inhibitor trials the results of the SGLT-2 inhibitor trials took the endocrinology community by surprise. The first trial, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed in 2015 that the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular risk and had important additional benefits in terms of reducing heart failure and slowing progression of kidney function decline [18••, 19••]. These results were recently confirmed in the CANVAS study program with the SGLT-2 inhibitor canagliflozin [20••].The mechanisms for cardiovascular and kidney protection of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes mellitus are incompletely understood. This review summarizes new insights in the potential protective mechanisms of SGLT-2 inhibitors. In the context of recently started renal outcome trials, we will also review the potential benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease.Metabolic Effects of SGLT-2 InhibitorsIn healthy glucose-tolerant individuals with a glomerular filtration rate of 125 ml/min/1.73m2 180 gram glucose is filtered each day by the kidney. In these healthy conditions, urinary glucose concentration is absent owing to an effective reabsorption system, consisting of two sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT): SGLT-1 and SGLT-2 [21]. The SGLT-2 transporter is located on the luminal side of the first segment of the proximal tubule in the kidney and is a high-capacity, low-affinity transporter. It is responsible for the reabsorption of approximately 90% of all filtered glucose. The remaining 10% of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed by the low-capacity high-affinity SGLT-1 transporter which is located in more distal segments of the proximal tubule [22]. Both transporters are also located in other organs than the kidney. For example, SGLT-1 transporters actively transport glucose from the lumen into the enterocyte of the small intestine. SGLT-2 transporters are also located in muscles, the heart, brain, and liver [23]. However, it appears that SGLT-2 inhibitors specifically inhibit the SGLT-2 transporter in the proximal tubule of the kidney, demonstrated by a recent study using positron emission tomography with 4-[18F]fluoro-dapagliflozin [24]. In patients with diabetes in whom plasma glucose levels exceed 400 mg glucose per 100 ml plasma, SGLT-2 transporters become saturated and the maximum capacity threshold to reabsorb glucose is reached resulting in increased glycosuria [22].The increased knowledge on the role of the kidney in maintaining glucose homeostasis, in particular the SGLT transporter system, led to the development of drugs inhibiting SGLT. Early experimental studies with phlorizin showed that SGLT inhibition augmented glycosuria and decreased plasma glucose levels [25–27]. However, the clinical development program of this drug was stopped due to gastro-intestinal side effects, which appeared to be caused by blocking SGLT-1 in the gastro-intestinal tract. More selective SGLT-2 inhibitors were subsequently synthesized and investigated. Three of them, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin are registered for clinical use in the USA and Europe. Ipragliflozin, tofugliflozin, and luseogliflozin are available in Japan and ertugliflozin and sotugliflozin, combined SGLT-1/SGLT-2 inhibitors, are under investigation. Table shows the molecular structure and the main pharmacokinetic parameters of these SGLT-2 inhibitors.Table 1Overview of SGLT-2 inhibitors currently registered or in late phase clinical developmentSGLT-2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion by approximately 70–80 gram per day and decrease HbA1c by approximately 0.5 to 0.8% [28]. SGLT-2 inhibitors can be used in combination with other glucose-lowering drugs, and their efficacy to lower HbA1c is not altered when used as adjunct to metformin, sulphonyl urea (SU) derivatives, DDP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 RA or insulin.When compared with other glucose-lowering drugs, the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors to lower HbA1c seems modest. However, head-to-head comparisons between SGLT-2 inhibitors and SU derivatives or DPP-4 inhibitors have shown similar efficacy [29–31], and compared with SU derivatives, SGLT-2 inhibitors are more durable over time [31]. The glycemic efficacy appears to depend on the starting HbA1c values with less efficacious effects being observed in patients with low HbA1c values [32, 33]. The lower efficacy at low plasma glucose levels also accounts for the low risk of hypoglycemia observed with this drug class. Another possibility for the low risk of hypoglycemia with SGLT-2 inhibitors is that these agents may stimulate endogenous glucose production [34]. In addition, it is important to note that only approximately 50% of the total filtered glucose is blocked by SGLT-2 inhibitors [35]. This probably contributes to the low risk of hypoglycemia.SGLT-2 inhibitors are also associated with a consistent 2 to 3 kg weight loss. The effect on body weight, reflecting net calorie loss due to increased glucose excretion, is observed directly after treatment initiation and plateaus after approximately 6 months [36, 37]. The stabilization of body weight loss is likely explained by increased food intake resulting in a new caloric balance. In contrast with other glucose-lowering drugs, weight loss with SGLT-2 inhibitors can be attributed to reductions in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue whereas other glucose-lowering drugs have mainly shown to ameliorate subcutaneous adipose tissue [37]. The clinical relevance of this finding is underscored by studies demonstrating an association of high visceral, but not subcutaneous fat, with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes [38].Natriuresis and Blood Pressure Effects of SGLT-2 InhibitorsThe SGLT-2 transporter is responsible for the reabsorption of both glucose and sodium. In addition to glycosuric effects, inhibition of the SGLT-2 transporter also leads to inhibition of proximal sodium reabsorption. Accordingly, in patients with type 2 diabetes who were managed in a carefully controlled environment, it has been shown that dapagliflozin at doses of 5, 25, and 100 mg cause a dose-dependent increase in 3-day sodium excretion ranging from 55 to 134 mmol after 24 h (Fig. ) [39, 40]. Further research with consecutive 24-h urine sampling over multiple days is ongoing to characterize the magnitude and durability of the natriuretic/diuretic effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors in more detail (clinical trials identifier {""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT03152084"",""term_id"":""NCT03152084""}}NCT03152084). The reduction in plasma volume of about 7%, as observed in one study with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function, is likely a result of the increased natriuresis and diuresis [41]. In that study, dapagliflozin was directly compared with hydrochlorothiazide. Interestingly, the decrease in body weight during the first 2 weeks with dapagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide was exactly similar, suggesting that the fall in body weight is not only explained by a net loss of calorie intake but also occurs on the basis of a natriuretic effect. As a consequence of this natriuresis and concurrent osmotic diuresis, blood pressure decreases in response to SGLT-2 inhibition. Indeed, reductions in systolic blood pressure of about 2 to 4 mmHg have been reported in almost all clinical trials with SGLT-2 inhibitors [42]. Based on epidemiologic studies, this would translate into approximately 14% cardiovascular and 18% renal risk reduction [43, 44]. Blood pressure reductions appear to occur both in day time and night time, although not all studies unequivocally demonstrated this [41, 45]. Interestingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors also appear to improve the ability of having a nocturnal fall in blood pressure (dipping) in non-dipping patients with type 2 diabetes. This is of relevance as blood pressure non-dipping patients are at higher risk of cardiovascular events [46]. It should be noted that the blood pressure effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors appear independent of concomitant blood pressure lowering medication. While some have suggested that concomitant renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitor or diuretic use may enhance or blunt efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors, clinical studies suggest this not to be true [47].Dapagliflozin induces approximately 55, 105, and 134 mEq negative sodium balance over 3 days at 5, 25, and 100 mg per day respectively. Data derived from reference [39]Recently, various studies have documented that the skin can buffer large amounts of sodium independently of extracellular water, body weight, and 24-h urinary sodium excretion. New techniques using 23Na-magnetic resonance imaging have become available to measure skin sodium, and it has been shown that high tissue sodium content is associated with cardiovascular risk markers [48]. Six weeks treatment with dapagliflozin has been suggested to reduce skin sodium content which may represent another sodium dependent mechanism by which SGLT-2 inhibitors protect against cardiovascular and heart failure risk [49].The diuretic effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors are also thought to be involved in improvements in arterial compliance. Optimal blood pressure control is difficult to achieve in patients with DKD and is a key factor contributing to vascular rigidity and stiffness. Aortic pulse wave velocity, an established method to determine arterial stiffness, has been shown to decrease significantly in response to empagliflozin treatment [50]. The reduction in arterial stiffness observed with empagliflozin treatment could not be explained by changes in nitric oxide, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity or sympathetic nervous system activity. Supposedly, other factors mediate the beneficial effects on arterial stiffness such as reduction in weight loss or induction of a negative sodium balance which cause relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells.Cardiovascular Outcome TrialsThe cardiovascular protective effects of the SGLT-2 inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin are now established in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials (Table ) [18••, 20••]. The EMPA-REG trial enrolled 7020 participants with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease who were randomly assigned to empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg or matched placebo. The trial showed after 3.1 years follow-up that empagliflozin resulted in a 14% relative cardiovascular risk reduction (HR, 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74 to 0.99; p &lt; 0.001 for non-inferiority, and p = 0.04 for superiority) [18••]. Interestingly, a subsequent prespecified analysis showed that empagliflozin had a marked kidney protective effect. The established kidney endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine and initiation of renal replacement therapy occurred less frequently in patients treated with empagliflozin vs. placebo (44 and 55% relative risk reductions, respectively; p &lt; 0.001), although the number of these events was small [19••].Table 2Summary table CANVAS and EMPAREG trialsStudyPopulationCV endpointsCV risk reduction (%)Renal endpointsRenal risk reduction (%)Adverse eventsEmpagliflozin EMPA-REG (n = 7020) [18••, 19••]Participants with type 2 diabetes, an eGFR &gt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2, who were at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) diseaseComposite of death from CV causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke14Incident/worsening nephropathy39Genital infection, urosepsisProgression to macroalbuminuria38Hospitalization for heart failure35Doubling serum creatinine44CV death38Renal replacement therapy (RRT)55Canaglifozin CANVAS (n = 10,142) [20••]Participants with type 2 diabetes and an eGFR &gt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2, who were ≥ 30 years of age and had a history of symptomatic artherosclerotic CV disease or were ≥ 50 years of age with 2 risk factors for CV diseaseComposite of death from CV causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke14Progression of albuminuria27Fracture risk, amputation, genital infection, volume depletion40% reduction in eGFR, RRT, or renal death40Hospitalization for heart failure33CV death13Death from any cause13The results from the CANVAS program were recently reported. The CANVAS program consisted of two randomized controlled trials involving 10,142 participants with either established cardiovascular disease or at risk of cardiovascular disease. Participants were followed for a median of 2.4 years. Similar to the EMPA-REG trial, in the CANVAS program, canagliflozin reduced the relative risks of the primary cardiovascular endpoint by 14% (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97; p &lt; 0.001 for non-inferiority, and p = 0.02 for superiority). In addition, canagliflozin also caused a marked 40% reduction in the risks of the primary renal outcome consisting of a 40% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, the need for renal replacement therapy, and renal death (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.77) [20••].Despite the impressive results on kidney function, it should be mentioned that the EMPA-REG and CANVAS trials were not designed to assess effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the kidney. Therefore, the results should be considered hypothesis generating in terms of kidney outcomes and future prospective trials, as described below, are needed to confirm these findings. Nevertheless, the consistent and impressive results highlight the potential of SGLT-2 inhibitors for the treatment of DKD.Renal Protective PathwaysThe protective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the kidney are likely explained by multiple mechanisms. In addition to reductions in HbA1c, blood pressure and body weight, other mechanisms likely contribute to the marked protective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the kidney. These mechanisms include restoration of glomerular feedback, improving renal proximal tubule oxygenation, and suppressing anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic pathways (Fig. ).Proposed pathways of renal protective effects: firstly, SGLT2-inhibitors may reduce glomerular hyperfiltration through restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback, an effect which is mediated by increased sodium delivery to the distal tubule. Secondly, SGLT2-inhibitiors ameliorate renal oxygenation owing to reduced tubular workload. Thirdly, SGLT-2 inhibitors may exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effectsGlomerular hyperfiltration is one of the earliest clinical manifestations of DKD and is caused by a complex interplay of diabetes-induced hormonal and structural changes in the nephron. Previous studies, particular in patients with type 1 diabetes, have shown that glomerular hyperfiltration is associated with a higher risk of microalbuminuria and progressive kidney function decline [51]. It is assumed that decreased sodium delivery to the macula densa leads to suppression of tubuloglomerular feedback resulting in afferent vasodilation, increased renal blood flow, and hyperfiltration. SGLT-2 inhibitors increase distal sodium delivery and thereby restore tubuloglomerular feedback and hyperfiltration [52]. This is clinically manifested by an acute drop in eGFR of approximately 4 to 6 ml/min/1.73m2 which is completely reversible after SGLT-2 inhibitor cessation, even after years of treatment. Thus, the acute fall in eGFR following SGLT-2 inhibition can in most circumstances be interpreted as a sign of efficacy rather than an adverse effect.Another mechanism that could potentially explain the protective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors relates to the improvement in renal hypoxia that is typically observed in diabetic kidneys [53, 54]. The proximal tubule is responsible for the reabsorption of large amounts of water, organic solutes, and electrolytes. These processes are oxygen dependent and cause a decrease in oxygen tension in kidney tissues. The reduction in sodium and glucose reabsorption induced by SGLT-2 inhibitors reduces tubular workload and could ameliorate renal oxygenation resulting in improvements in tubular cell structural integrity and possibly function. Indeed, an experimental study reported that acute SGLT inhibition with phlorizin improved renal cortical oxygen tension in diabetic animals, although unfortunately medullary hypoxia increased [55]. Clearly, more research in humans is required to determine the clinical relevance, but given the central role of hypoxia in DKD, this may represent an important pathway by which SGLT-2 inhibitors confer renal protection.Inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis are involved in the initiation and progression of kidney disease [56, 57]. Experimental studies have linked SGLT-2 inhibitors with reductions in anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-fibrotic markers. For example, MCP-1, NF-kB, levels of 8-OHdG, and l-fatty acid-binding protein (markers of oxidative stress and macrophages) decreased in experimental studies after treatment with ipragliflozin and empagliflozin [58–60]. A recent study translated these preclinical findings to the human situation and demonstrated that 6 weeks treatment with the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin decreased urinary levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 and monocyte-attractive-protein-1 [61]. At present, several preclinical and clinical studies examine the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on biomarkers of inflammation and fibrosis.SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to lower albuminuria dramatically, possibly by a tubuloglomerular feedback-induced reduction in glomerular hypertension. All registered SGLT-2 inhibitors have consistently shown to lower albuminuria by 30 to 40%. This effect appears to be independent of concomitant ACEi or ARB use and could not be explained by concomitant reductions in HbA1c, blood pressure, or body weight [62–64]. It should be noted that almost all studies investigating the albuminuria-lowering effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors were post-hoc analyses and not primarily designed for this purpose. A recently published prospective randomized cross-over study specifically designed to characterize the albuminuria lowering effect of dapagliflozin confirmed that dapagliflozin decreased albuminuria by 40% compared with placebo treatment [65].SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Patients with DKDThe registered SGLT-2 inhibitors in the USA and Europe are not recommended for use in patients with DKD, as it has been shown that their effects on glycemic control attenuates at lower eGFR. It has been hypothesized that the lower glycemic efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with DKD is a result of diminished glucose filtration. Interestingly however, pooled analyses from all phase 3 trials with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have shown that the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors on other cardiovascular and renal risk factors such as blood pressure, body weight, albuminuria, and uric acid is not attenuated in people with DKD [66–68]. The mechanisms as to why SGLT-2 inhibitors retain their efficacy in lowering these risk markers in patients with DKD is incompletely understood, but it is possible that patients with DKD are more sensitive to mild natriuretic/osmotic diuresis. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the observed improvements in blood pressure, body weight, and albuminuria in patients with DKD suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors exert cardiovascular and renal protective effects in this population. Indeed, subgroup analyses of the EMPA-REG trial and the CANVAS program have shown that the effects of empagliflozin and canagliflozin on the primary cardiovascular endpoint are similar in patients with baseline eGFR above and below 60 ml/min/1.73m2 [18••, 20••]. However, the number of patients with impaired kidney function in these trials was low (e.g., 26% in the EMPA-REG trial), and therefore the number of patients who required dialysis, the clinically meaningful endpoint in trials of kidney disease progression, was less than 30 [19••]. This is no surprise since the trials were not designed to assess effects of empagliflozin and canagliflozin on kidney endpoints. The ongoing CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials (clinical trials identifier {""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT02065791"",""term_id"":""NCT02065791""}}NCT02065791 and {""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT03036150"",""term_id"":""NCT03036150""}}NCT03036150) are specifically designed to establish the safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in slowing kidney progression in patients with DKD. Design and patient characteristics of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trial are described in Table .Table 3Study characteristics of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trialsCREDENCEDAPA-CKDClincial trials identifier{""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT02065791"",""term_id"":""NCT02065791""}}NCT02065791{""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT03036150"",""term_id"":""NCT03036150""}}NCT03036150DesignRandomized placebo-controlled double-blind trialRandomized placebo-controlled double-blind trialStudy PopulationType 2 diabetesChronic kidney diseaseUACR 300–3500 mg/gUACR 200–3500 mg/geGFR 30–90 ml/min/1.73m2eGFR 30–75 ml/min/1.73m2Primary endpointComposite of end-stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine, renal or cardiovascular deathComposite of end-stage renal disease, ≥ 50% eGFR decline, renal or cardiovascular deathSecondary endpoints-Cardiovascular death-All-cause death-Cardiovascular composite endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, CV death)-Renal composite endpoint (end-stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine, renal death)-All-cause deathFirst occurrence of:-End-stage renal disease, ≥ 50% eGFR decline, renal death-Cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failureNumber of patients44644000Anticipated trial completionJune 2019November 2020SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Non-diabetic Kidney DiseaseThe EMPA-REG trial and CANVAS trials showed that the Kaplan-Meier curves for the renal endpoint diverged already during the initial months of the trial. Remarkably, a 2-year clinical trial comparing head-to-head canagliflozin with glimepiride showed that with canagliflozin the rate of kidney function decline was significantly lower while glycemic control was similar between the two classes (Fig. ) [69]. These data combined indicate that the protective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors are unlikely to be mediated by improvements in glycemic control. The restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback along with glomerular afferent vasoconstriction is thought to be an important mechanism accounting for the protective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on kidney function. Based on these non-glycemic effects, there is a strong imperative to extend the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors to non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases (CKD) that are also characterized by glomerular hypertension, hyperfiltration, and significant albuminuria. For example, various studies have documented that obesity induced CKD is associated with altered kidney hemodynamics leading to increased renal plasma flow and GFR (i.e., hyperfiltration) [70]. The mechanism is likely a result of increased reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule leading to altered tubule-glomerular feedback. In hypertensive nephrosclerosis, loss of autoregulation of the afferent and efferent arteriole in the kidney drive a hyperfiltration type of glomerular lesion and subsequently kidney damage [71]. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is another CKD subtype which could benefit from SGLT-2 inhibitors. Patients often present with significant proteinuria which is a strong determinant of renal prognosis. Current therapy for these patients consists of RAAS inhibition, as well as immunosuppression, but is insufficient in a considerable proportion of patients [72–74]. SGLT-2 inhibition may be a promising adjunctive therapy to further lower intra-glomerular pressure and proteinuria. Secondary focal segmental glomerulo-sclerosis (FSGS) is characterized by hypertension, significant proteinuria, and is caused by a reduction in renal mass due to various causes such as surgical ablation, sickle cell anemia, or episodes of active glomerulonephritis [75]. Importantly, hyperfiltration is common in all the aforementioned disorders. Reversing the hyperfiltering state through pharmacological interventions, such as with SGLT-2 inhibitors, may improve the renal outcome of these patients [76].Canagliflozin induces an acute fall in eGFR during the first 4 weeks of treatment followed by a stabilization of eGFR decline during subsequent 2 years follow-up, whereas eGFR progressively declined over time during treatment with glimepiride. HbA1c levels were similar at baseline and during follow-up in the canagliflozin and glimepiride group. (Republished with permission from the American Society of Nephrology from Heerspink et al. [69])An important question to be addressed is of course whether it is safe to use SGLT-2 inhibitors in non-diabetic CKD patients. As described above, the risk of hypoglycemia with SGLT-2 inhibitors in non-diabetic patients is likely low as the degree of glucose-lowering positively correlates with the filtered glucose load which is low in non-diabetic CKD populations. Clinical experience with SGLT-2 inhibitors in non-diabetic conditions is currently limited, but studies in healthy volunteers have shown that SGLT-2 inhibitors can be safely used at high doses, even up to 50-fold the dose used in clinical practice, without inducing hypoglycemia [77]. Thus, the currently available data suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors can be safely used in non-diabetic conditions at least with respect to hypoglycemia. A number of trials, such as the DIAMOND ({""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT03190694"",""term_id"":""NCT03190694""}}NCT03190694) and DAPA-CKD ({""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT03036150"",""term_id"":""NCT03036150""}}NCT03036150), are currently ongoing to investigate the efficacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with non-diabetic CKD. These trials are due to report in 2019 and 2021.Who Should Be Treated with SGLT-2 Inhibitors?Current guidelines recommend to use SGLT-2 inhibitors as adjunct to metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease [78]. This recommendation is based on the EMPA-REG trial. A well-known side effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors is genital infections, probably mediated by glycosuria. Patients with multiple episodes of genital infections are therefore not the ideal candidates to start an SGLT-2 inhibitor. Physicians are also advised to be careful with SGLT-2 prescription in patients at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as this may be an important although rare serious adverse event related to this drug class. Of note, the risk of DKA with SGLT-2 inhibitors is low in patients with type 2 diabetes, which may explain why DKA signals were not detected in clinical trials. However, based on administrative databases and real-world evidence a 2-fold increased risk of DKA has been suggested when compared with DPP-4 inhibitors [79]. It should be noted however that other database studies suggested no increased risk of DKA with SGLT-2 inhibitors [80].Volume depletion is another adverse effect detected in clinical trials. Patients at risk of volume depletion, such as those with gastrointestinal fluid losses or reduced oral intake, are therefore not good candidates to start SGLT-2 inhibitors. In addition, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be withheld during procedures that may reduce renal perfusion such as elective surgery or intravenous contrast procedures in the same way as is done with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Along the same line, SGLT-2 inhibitors should not be continued during short-term periods of NSAID use, as the combination of these two drug classes may reduce renal perfusion and may evoke acute kidney injury.The CANVAS program unexpectedly showed that patients treated with canagliflozin had a 2-fold higher risk of lower limb amputations compared with placebo-treated patients. Patients with a history of amputations or with peripheral vascular disease were at highest absolute risk for amputations during the trial, but the relative effect of canagliflozin was similar across subgroups [20••]. The underlying mechanism of this potential adverse event is unclear nor is it known whether this represents a class effect or an effect particularly associated with canagliflozin. A recent analysis of the FDA pharmacovigilance database suggested that canagliflozin use, but not dapagliflozin or empagliflozin use, may be associated with an increased risk of amputations [81]. However, causality cannot be assessed based on pharmacovigilance databases and future trials in high-risk populations are needed to determine whether peripheral ischemia necessitating amputations are a serious adverse event of this drug. This adverse event complicates the management of patients with peripheral vascular disease. On the one hand, they had the highest risk of amputations in CANVAS, but they also experienced a marked benefit with respect to cardiovascular outcomes.

Antihyperglycemic and Blood Pressure Effects of Empagliflozin in Black Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension,"Clinical PerspectiveWhat Is New?Despite a high prevalence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, blacks are underrepresented in major antihyperglycemia trials; this was the first dedicated trial of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor in a black patient population with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension receiving 1 or more antihypertensive medications.Empagliflozin was associated with significant and sustained reductions in glycohemoglobin and body weight.Reductions in several blood pressure (BP) indicators, including mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP, were sustained.What Are the Clinical Implications?Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in general, and empagliflozin in particular, are attractive choices for glycemic control, weight reduction, and BP lowering in blacks with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk populations such as blacks, but further confirmation is needed; some of this cardiovascular disease risk reduction is likely attributable to lower BP.The BP-lowering effect of empagliflozin started as early as 12 weeks, but was greater at week 24 than at week 12, suggesting the full BP effect may require several months of therapy to be fully manifested.IntroductionEditorial, see p 2110Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that improves glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to their salutary effect in diabetes mellitus, SGLT2 inhibitors are now known to have beneficial effects on blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, in particular, reduced risk of death from cardiovascular causes and hospitalization for heart failure.1 CVD benefits are believed to be attributable to the non–glucose-lowering effects of the drug, including BP lowering,2 which has been a consistent feature with SGLT2 inhibition.3,4 In addition to reducing 24-hour ambulatory BP, SGLT2 inhibitors lower body weight.5,6 The precise mechanism for their antihypertensive effect is not yet fully understood but is believed to depend at least in part on the drug's main renal effect (osmotic diuresis with modest obligatory natriuresis) and the accompanying reduction in extracellular volume.7–9 Other favorable CVD outcomes have been observed as well. For example, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Removal of Excess Glucose Outcome) in adults with T2DM and established CVD, empagliflozin, when added to standard of care, reduced CVD mortality (−38%), all-cause mortality (−32%), and heart failure hospitalizations (−35%) in comparison with placebo.1 CVD benefits were evident early in the trial and continued throughout the study.1Blacks are typically underrepresented in clinical trials of CVD and T2DM.10,11 This is unfortunate, because they are generally considered to be at high risk for hypertension and CVD in comparison with whites.12–14 Blacks also have lower rates of BP control and a greater prevalence of resistant hypertension than whites. The REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke)15 reported that only 30% of black participants with T2DM and hypertension met the currently recommended target BP of &lt;130/80 mm Hg.16 With respect to efficacy, black patients have lower values of plasma renin activity, reduced BP responsiveness to renin-angiotensin system–blocking drugs, relatively greater BP responses to diuretics and calcium channel blockers as initial monotherapy, and a greater need for combination antihypertensive therapy.14,16In light of these important issues, this study in black patients with T2DM and hypertension compared the effects of once-daily empagliflozin with matching placebo over 24 weeks with respect to glycemic control, body weight, office and ambulatory BP, safety, and tolerability.MethodsFull details of the design, rationale, and methodology used in this study were reported previously17 and are summarized below.The sponsor of the NCT02182830 study (Boehringer Ingelheim) is committed to responsible sharing of clinical study reports, related clinical documents, and patient-level clinical study data. Researchers are invited to submit enquiries via the Clinical Study Data Request website (https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com).Study DesignThis was a 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3b study performed at 92 centers in the United States (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; unique identifier: NCT02182830). The study included a 2-week open-label placebo run-in period, a 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period with dose escalation after 4 weeks, and a 2-week follow-up period (Figure 1). During the placebo run-in period, patients continued to receive their background antihyperglycemic and antihypertensive therapies. At the end of the placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either empagliflozin or placebo in the double-blind study period. Patients randomly assigned to empagliflozin received 10 mg empagliflozin for the first 4 weeks, after which the dose was escalated to 25 mg until week 24. After termination of the trial medication, patients were followed up for a further 2 weeks (to week 26).Figure 1. Study design. During placebo run-in, eligible patients continued to receive their background antihyperglycemic therapy and antihypertensive therapy unchanged. Thereafter, patients still meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either empagliflozin or matching placebo and entered the double-blind period. Patients in the empagliflozin group received 10 mg empagliflozin for the first 4 weeks, after which the dose was escalated to 25 mg until week 24. Patients were followed up for 2 weeks after termination of the trial medication (ie, to week 26).

This study was funded by the Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company Diabetes Alliance.Study ParticipantsEligible patients were self-identified black individuals aged ≥18 years with T2DM and hypertension, with insufficient control of glycemia (glycohemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥7.0% to ≤11.0% [≥53 to ≤97 mmol/mol]) and BP (mean seated systolic BP [SBP] 140–180 mm Hg). All patients provided written informed consent before participating in the trial.Study TreatmentsPatients were either drug-naive or pretreated with a stable dose (≥12 weeks) of oral antihyperglycemic treatment, which was continued during the trial. All patients were on at least 1 antihypertensive medication that was similarly held stable. Patients received both glucose- and antihypertensive-rescue medication based on predefined criteria.17End Points and AssessmentsPatients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring during the placebo run-in period, at week 12, and at week 24, and were required to have a successful ambulatory BP measurement before randomization. The primary end point was the between-group difference in the change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24. Key secondary end points were between-group differences in changes from baseline in mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP at week 12, mean trough ambulatory SBP at week 12, body weight at week 24, and trough seated (office) SBP at week 12. Diastolic BP (DBP) was evaluated in an exploratory manner. The between-group differences in mean changes from baseline in 24-hour ambulatory heart rate (HR), daytime mean ambulatory HR, nighttime ambulatory HR, and trough seated HR were analyzed as further efficacy end points. Safety end points included hypoglycemic events (plasma glucose ≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L] ± assistance required) and adverse events (AEs) of special interest (details in the online-only Data Supplement), clinical laboratory tests, orthostatic BP testing at weeks 12 and 24, and lipid parameters.Statistical AnalysesIt was calculated that having 77 patients in each treatment arm would provide a statistical power of at least 80% at the 2-sided α-level of 5% (accounting for a 20% dropout rate) for comparisons of HbA1c, BP, and body weight in the empagliflozin and placebo groups. This is based on the assumption that the difference in change from baseline versus placebo in 24-hour SBP is 5 mm Hg with a SD of 10 mm Hg (resulting in a power of 80%), and the difference in body weight is 2 kg with an SD of 2.3 kg (resulting in a power of 99%). With this sample size, the power to detect a 0.6% difference in HbA1c with a SD of 1.1% will be &gt;85%.A hierarchical multiple testing procedure was used to evaluate superiority for the primary end point, followed by evaluation of the superiority of the key secondary end points, while maintaining the overall probability of a type I error at 0.05. The primary end point of change from baseline in HbA1c to week 24 was analyzed by using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) to obtain adjusted means for the treatment effects. The key secondary end points of the change from baseline in 24-hour ambulatory SBP and the change from mean trough ambulatory SBP at week 12 were analyzed via an ANCOVA approach with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) for missing data. The key secondary end points of change from baseline in body weight at week 24 and the change from baseline in trough seated SBP up to week 12 were also analyzed by using an MMRM.A restricted maximum likelihood–based MMRM approach was used to compare the change from baseline in HbA1c at 24 weeks between the empagliflozin group and placebo group, which included fixed, categorical effect of treatment, pretreatment with metformin at screening, renal function at baseline, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, and the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline HbA1c and baseline HbA1c-by-visit interaction, as well. Key secondary end points, change from baseline in body weight at 24 weeks, and change from baseline in trough seated SBP (office) at week 12, were applied to a similar MMRM model as the primary end point. ANCOVA (LOCF) was used to compare the change from baseline in mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP at week 12 between the empagliflozin group and the placebo group, which included fixed, categorical effect of treatment, pretreatment with metformin at screening, renal function at baseline, and fixed continuous covariates baseline mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP, as well. A similar model was applied to the change from baseline in trough ambulatory SBP at week 12. All these analyses were prespecified in the statistical analysis plan.Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed for the primary and key secondary end points. Several sensitivity analyses were preplanned and showed the robustness of the results of primary analysis. The sensitivity analyses for the primary end point were as follows: (1) MMRM FAS (OC-IR): full analysis set, observed cases including values on rescue medication; (2) MMRM PPS (OC): per-protocol set, observed cases on-treatment; (3) ANCOVA FAS (LOCF): full analysis set, last observation carried forward; (4) ANCOVA FAS (MI): full analysis set, multiple imputation; and (5) MMRM FAS (OC-AD): full analysis set, observed cases including values after discontinuation and after antihyperglycemic rescue medication (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). Safety analyses were descriptive in nature.ResultsStudy PatientsBetween September 2014 and November 2016, 166 patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment. Approximately 80% of patients in both treatment groups completed the trial and trial medication. The study participant flow diagram is presented in Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement. Of 166 patients randomly assigned, 150 received study medication and had at least 1 on-treatment HbA1c measurement and, thus, were included in the full analysis set (FAS; placebo, n=72; empagliflozin 10–25 mg, n=78). Sensitivity analyses of efficacy data included the MMRM FAS (OC-IR) and comprised 150 patients: 72 placebo and 78 empagliflozin (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across both treatment groups, as shown in Table 1. Overall, 52.7% were men, mean (SD) age was 56.8 (9.3) years, and mean duration of T2DM was 9.3 (7.1) years. Patients had a high mean body mass index at baseline, and high mean levels of SBP and DBP, as well. Thirty-seven percent of patients (56/150) were receiving ≥3 background antihypertensive medications. The most common type of background antihypertensive medications received were agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (125/150, 83.3%), diuretics (71/150, 47.3%), and calcium channel blockers (62/150, 41.3%) (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Background antihyperglycemic medications are presented in Table III in the online-only Data Supplement. There was a slight imbalance in baseline demographics in terms of medical history of urinary tract infection (4 patients [5.6%] in the placebo group, 11 patients [14.1%] in the empagliflozin group) and genital infection (5 patients [6.9%] in the placebo group, and 1 patient [1.3%] in the empagliflozin group) (Table 1).Table 1.

The majority of patients were exposed to &gt;20 weeks of treatment. Treatment compliance was similar for both treatment groups; 67 of 72 (93.1%) patients in the placebo group and 75 of 78 (96.2%) patients in the empagliflozin group had an overall compliance within the accepted compliance window of 80% to 120%.EfficacyPrimary and secondary efficacy end point data are summarized in Table 2 (and Tables IV and V in the online-only Data Supplement).Table 2.

Results from sensitivity and subgroup analyses supported the findings of the primary analysis (ie, HbA1c; Table I in the online-only Data Supplement) and key secondary analyses (eg, body weight).BP End PointsReductions from baseline to week 12 in 24-hour ambulatory SBP were significantly greater with empagliflozin than with placebo (adjusted mean [SE]: empagliflozin 140.21 [1.41] versus placebo 145.42 [1.47]; placebo-corrected difference, –5.21 mm Hg [95% CI, –9.24 to –1.18; P=0.0117]; Table 2, Figure 2A, and Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement). This difference was increased at week 24 (placebo-corrected difference, –8.39 mm Hg [95% CI, –13.74 to –3.04; P=0.0025]; Table 2). Reductions from baseline in trough ambulatory SBP were significantly greater with empagliflozin than with placebo at week 12 (placebo-corrected difference, –5.99 mm Hg [95% CI, –11.16 to –0.81; P=0.0237]; Table 2). Empagliflozin treatment produced a reduced trough seated (office) SBP at weeks 12 and 24 (Figure 2B and Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement); the difference was statistically significant versus placebo at week 24 only (placebo-corrected difference, –7.43 mm Hg [95% CI, –12.37 to –2.48; P=0.0036]; Table 2). DBP results showed reductions in ambulatory and seated values in the empagliflozin group versus the placebo group, with nominal P values at week 24 (Table 2); however, these end points were tested in an exploratory manner only. Hourly mean SBP and DBP were consistently reduced in the empagliflozin group relative to the placebo group over a 24-hour period after treatment for 12 weeks and 24 weeks (Figure 3), with no changes in nocturnal variation in BP. Results from sensitivity and subgroup analyses supported the findings of the key secondary analyses (eg, SBP at week 12; Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement).Figure 2.

Reductions in DBP were similarly observed but were only significant for daytime and awake time parameters. BP reductions observed with empagliflozin were not associated with changes in pulse rate (at week 12, adjusted mean change from baseline in mean 24-hour ambulatory pulse rate for empagliflozin versus placebo was 1.31 beats per minute; 95% CI, –0.59 to 3.21; P=0.1742 in the FAS).Further End PointsHR did not markedly change over the treatment period across all 4 analyses and analysis populations (Table V in the online-only Data Supplement). Mean differences in HR changes from baseline between groups were small (&lt;2 beats per minute differences) and were not considered to be clinically meaningful.SafetySafety data are summarized in Table 3. The proportion of patients who had AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to the discontinuation of study drug was similar in the empagliflozin and placebo groups. Most AEs were either mild or moderate in intensity; 2 patients (2.6%) in the placebo group and 1 patient (1.3%) in the empagliflozin group experienced a severe AE. Drug-related AEs (preferred terms) with an incidence of at least 2% in any treatment group were urinary tract infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, and increased serum creatinine. All serious AEs reported during the study were judged by the investigator not to be drug-related. No deaths were reported during the study.Table 3.

Mean changes in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio values (mg/g) from baseline (mean [SD], 11.1 [7.0] mg/g for the empagliflozin group and 10.4 [6.8] mg/g for the placebo group) to the end of treatment (15.3 [19.6] mg/g and 16.1 [32.5] mg/g, respectively) were comparable between treatment groups for patients with normal baseline values (change from baseline in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 4.5 [20.1] and 4.2 [30.7] for empagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively).No significant changes in sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, or phosphate were observed. Uric acid values decreased by ≈15%. The mean (SD) hematocrit increased in the empagliflozin group by 2.4% (4.3%) from baseline (41.9% [4.9%]) to the last value on treatment, in comparison with –0.5% (4.1%) in the placebo group (baseline value, 41.6% [6.0%]).DiscussionThis study is the first placebo-controlled clinical trial of an SGLT2 inhibitor in a black population with T2DM and hypertension. The use of ambulatory BP monitoring is a strength of the study design that resulted in the avoidance of the problem of office hypertension (white coat effect), suggesting that these findings will be relevant to the clinical setting. By 24 weeks, empagliflozin (10–25 mg daily) therapy improved the primary end point, HbA1c (≈0.8% lower), and induced modest weight loss (≈1.2 kg). Of substantial additional interest, empagliflozin consistently lowered office and 24-hour ambulatory SBP and DBP, by about –4/–2 mm Hg greater than placebo at 12 weeks, and by about –7/–4 mm Hg greater than placebo at 24 weeks (Figure 3). Furthermore, this effect of empagliflozin was observed even though patients were already receiving at least 1 antihypertensive medication in addition to study treatment. The issue of the interaction of empagliflozin and anti–renin-angiotensin agents also deserves comment, because ≈84% of participants were continued on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker throughout the study. When empagliflozin was added to a renin-angiotensin system–blocking drug, the BP response was very similar to that of adding a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Although monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker is less effective in blacks than in whites, adding a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide to a renin-angiotensin system blocker eliminates the racial difference in response, and the second agent will demonstrate greater incremental efficacy in blacks.18,19 The magnitude of the BP changes reported in this study is similar to other antihypertensive agents (eg, angiotensin receptor blockers) in a predominantly white population. Also, the greater reduction in BP at week 24 in comparison with week 12 should be considered by clinicians in the overall planning and management of black patients with T2DM and hypertension.Empagliflozin was well tolerated during the study period. Confirmed hypoglycemic AEs were reported in more patients receiving empagliflozin than placebo, but none of these events was severe and none required intervention or assistance. The percentage of patients with events consistent with urinary tract infection was comparable between both treatment groups. All the events consistent with urinary tract infection were mild or moderate in intensity, and none led to premature discontinuation of the study medication. The percentage of patients with events consistent with genital infection was higher with empagliflozin versus placebo; all events were mild in intensity and occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. The observed reductions in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio are consistent with all other empagliflozin studies. Although the changes were larger and more variable among patients with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, no definitive conclusions could be made because of the relatively small numbers of patients in these subgroups. Overall, the AE profile of empagliflozin was consistent with prior safety data in the wider T2DM patient population.20 Thus, our experience provides a clear rationale for the use of empagliflozin in black patients with T2DM and hypertension.The results of this study show comparatively small differences between office and 24-hour mean BP values, which is in contrast with the findings of studies of antihypertensive drugs, where changes in office BP are generally greater than the corresponding 24-hour mean BP values.21 This is often attributed to amelioration of the white coat effect by antihypertensive drugs.21 The mechanism is unknown but is believed to represent reduced sympathetic nervous system responsiveness during antihypertensive therapy. However, the white coat effect is much more prominent in whites than in nonwhites.22 Thus, it might be predicted that office and nonoffice BP changes would be similar in black patients during antihypertensive therapy, as shown in the present study.The results of this study also indicate a blunting of the nocturnal decline in BP among the study population. This reduction in diurnal variation in BP (nondipping) among black subjects has been reported to occur more frequently in these individuals than other racial groups.23 Nondipping BP has been associated with an increased risk of CVD events, which may result from increased sympathetic tone among these individuals, and an associated morning BP surge. Of note, a post hoc subgroup analysis from EMPA-REG BP reported that empagliflozin significantly reduced mean 24-hour SBP versus placebo in dippers and nondippers.24The present work extends prior observations of the BP-lowering effect of empagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors to the black population. The degree of SBP lowering observed in this study is somewhat greater than that reported with empagliflozin in a predominantly white patient population with T2DM and hypertension, in which the changes from baseline to week 12 in mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg were –3.44 mm Hg (95% CI, –4.78 to –2.09) and –4.16 mm Hg (95% CI, –5.50 to –2.83), respectively (both P&lt;0.001).6 In addition, the BP results reported here were broadly similar to those observed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial,1 although this study included a limited cohort of blacks and randomly assigned only participants with established CVD. Similar SBP reductions were reported in predominantly white patient populations with canagliflozin (6-week study; n=169)25 and dapagliflozin (12-week study; n=449).26 BP lowering of the magnitude demonstrated in this study would be expected to be associated with benefits in terms of reductions in the risk of CVD, in particular, among black patients. A population-based cohort study demonstrated that a 1–mm Hg reduction in SBP was associated with 13.5 (95% CI, 8.8–18.2) and 9.0 (95% CI, 6.3–11.6) fewer coronary heart disease events per 100 000 person-years, in black and white populations, respectively.27The mechanisms for these antihypertensive effects are not fully known. The 15% decrease in uric acid levels and modest weight loss (≈1.2 kg) reported in the present study were not considered to be significant factors affecting BP. However, the BP-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are believed to be related to modest volume depletion. Diuretics in general are highly effective in lowering BP in blacks, and thiazide diuretics are now recommended as first-line antihypertensive drugs in this population.16 It is thus not surprising that the effects of empagliflozin have an appreciable effect on BP in blacks with T2DM. Our results indicate that any reduction in blood volume related to empagliflozin administration is likely to be minor and is not accompanied by tachycardia. Empagliflozin has also been reported to reduce arterial stiffness,28,29 but this conclusion must be tempered by the dependence of arterial stiffness indicators on BP itself (a fact not fully discussed in prior studies). The short-term nature (12 weeks) of many studies is also problematic if one assumes that reduced stiffness represents aortic remodeling, because aortic smooth muscle cell turnover is quite slow, and aortic structure would not be expected to change very much in 3 months.30The cardiovascular and renal benefits of empagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly recognized. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial,1 the reduction in cardiovascular death may be partially attributable to the salutary BP benefits, but concomitant reductions occur in other established CVD risk factors, including blood glucose and body weight; changes in these risk factors with empagliflozin appear to be similar in nonblack patients.5,31Underrepresentation of minority populations in clinical trials remains a significant problem. Despite the fact that blacks have a high prevalence of morbidity and mortality from CVD, they comprise only a small fraction of participants (2% of the study population in T2DM clinical trials versus 67% for whites and 31% for Asians10 and ≈5% of participants in recent major cardiovascular outcomes trials in T2DM11). Reasons for this lack of inclusion are variable but include higher comorbidity rates (as in the Action for Health in Diabetes trial), poorer control of chronic conditions, increased safety concerns based on the higher prevalence of conditions thought to be life-limiting, and behaviors believed to predict poor study adherence.32 Other factors that may affect participation and retention include trust issues (eg, relative lack of minority investigators and competent centers familiar with the population), logistical issues (eg, availability of transportation or child care), and a lack of knowledge about the aims and potential benefits of clinical trials.33 It is important for a pharmaceutical trial to include representation from all subgroups likely to use that medical product because of unequal responses to a particular drug class.34 For example, with respect to BP, blacks respond less vigorously than whites to angiotensin receptor blockers.16,35 Different racial groups also tend to have different risk factor profiles and may not demonstrate a uniform natural history in a particular disease, including chronic kidney disease36 and heart failure.37,38 Although there is no legally enforceable requirement to include demographic subgroups in clinical trials, Section 907 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act gives the US Food and Drug Administration direction to take action on this issue, and its guidance for industry was published in 2016.39Study LimitationsSelf-reporting of race (eg, black) and ethnicity (eg, African American) is less accurate than genealogical DNA testing, but it is currently accepted by US Food and Drug Administration guidance as the best available practice.39 It should also be emphasized that this work does not constitute an indication for the use of empagliflozin as an antihypertensive drug. Despite its antihypertensive effects, empagliflozin is indicated for glycemic control in adults with T2DM as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and other medications, and for reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with T2DM and established CVD.20ConclusionsEmpagliflozin therapy (10–25 mg once daily) was safe and well tolerated in black adults with T2DM and hypertension, and its use was associated with reduction in HbA1c and body weight, and reduction in office and ambulatory SBP and DBP, as well. This study supports the use of empagliflozin in the treatment of blacks with T2DM, especially those with hypertension.AcknowledgmentsThe authors meet criteria for authorship as recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, were fully responsible for all content and editorial decisions, were involved at all stages of manuscript development, and approved the final version that reflects the authors' interpretation and conclusions.

Twenty-Four-Hour Blood Pressure-Lowering Effect of a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor in Patients With Diabetes and Uncontrolled Nocturnal Hypertension | Circulation,"Clinical PerspectiveWhat Is New?Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, particularly when nighttime blood pressure is elevated.This is the first time that a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.The addition of empagliflozin to existing antihypertensive therapy was associated with significant reductions in a variety of blood pressure measures, including ambulatory and home blood pressure.What Are the Clinical Implications?There is a growing body of data supporting the important benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.The reductions in blood pressure that occurred after the addition of empagliflozin therapy were of a clinically relevant magnitude that would be expected to reduce cardiovascular risk, and occurred in patients already receiving antihypertensive therapy (including angiotensin receptor blockers).IntroductionEditorial, see p 2110Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral hypoglycemic agents that act primarily by increasing the urinary elimination of glucose.1 In addition to reducing blood glucose, treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin has also been associated with weight loss and reductions in blood pressure (BP).2–5 In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (BI 10773 [Empagliflozin] Cardiovascular Blood Pressure Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and high cardiovascular risk with empagliflozin versus placebo significantly reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, heart failure–related hospitalizations, and progression of diabetic nephropathy.6–8 Although clinic BP was reduced by empagliflozin, the contribution of decreases in 24-hour BP, including nocturnal and morning time periods, to the observed benefit on cardiovascular outcomes could not be determined. In particular, nocturnal hypertension, or the nondipper pattern of nighttime BP, is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease including nonischemic heart failure, both in patients with hypertension and in the general population.9–11The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is also increased in T2DM patients.12 The cardiovascular disease and mortality risk are particularly high in T2DM patients with nocturnal hypertension.13–15 This highlights the importance of nighttime BP as a cardiovascular and mortality risk factor in patients with T2DM, and suggests that nighttime BP could be an important therapeutic target in these patients.The SACRA study (SGLT2 inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker [ARB] Combination Therapy in Patients With Diabetes and Uncontrolled Nocturnal Hypertension) used ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) to investigate the effects of adding empagliflozin to existing antihypertensive therapy on nighttime BP in T2DM patients and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension.MethodsThe SACRA study (NCT03050229) was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel group trial conducted in Japan. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Jichi Medical University School of Medicine. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, International on Harmonization Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment into the study.The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure.ParticipantsEligible patients were aged ≥20 years; had T2DM (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥6% and &lt;10%), seated clinic systolic BP (SBP) 130 to 159 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) 80 to 99 mm Hg, and nocturnal hypertension (SBP ≥115 mm Hg at 2, 3, and 4 a.m. during sleep 5 days before randomization, measured using home BP monitoring [HEM-7080-IC; Omron Healthcare Co Ltd, Kyoto, Japan]); were receiving stable antidiabetic treatment with or without antidiabetics for ≥8 weeks before baseline; and were receiving stable antihypertensive treatment that included an ARB for ≥8 weeks before baseline. Key exclusion criteria included history of diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic coma, renal and liver damage, and cardiovascular disease events (within 3 months before randomization; Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).Randomized TreatmentAfter an 8-week run-in period, eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated, pseudorandom sequence and was stratified by nighttime SBP, age, sex, and study center. Antihypertensive and antidiabetic medication could be changed at the discretion of the investigator.AssessmentsStudy visits were scheduled at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. Morning home BP monitoring using a validated BP monitoring device (HEM-7080-IC) was performed for 5 consecutive days before each study visit. Clinic BP was measured at each study visit. Twenty-four-hour ABPM was performed at baseline and week 12, after administration of study medication, using methods described previously.16 In brief, an automatic oscillometric method ABPM device (TM2431; A&amp;D Co, Tokyo, Japan) was used to record BP and pulse rate every 30 minutes for 24 hours. Twenty-four-hour BP was defined as the average of all readings over a 24-hour period. Nighttime BP was calculated as the average of BP values recorded over the period from when the patient went to bed until the patient got up; values over the rest of the day were used to calculate daytime BP. Investigators were unaware of glucose results during the entire treatment period. Safety was assessed based on laboratory findings, and the occurrence of adverse events and side effects documented during study visits.OutcomesThe primary efficacy end point was change from baseline in nighttime SBP and DBP measured using ABPM. Key secondary end points were change from baseline in mean 24-hour SBP/DBP and daytime BP at week 12. Other secondary efficacy end points were change from baseline to week 12 in morning home BP, clinic BP, HbA1c, and body weight. Additional end points were low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide) levels, atrial natriuretic peptide levels, magnesium levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR: men, 194×serum creatinine-1.094×age-0.287; women, 194× serum creatinine -1.094×age-0.287×0.739),17 urinary albumin creatinine ratio, and laboratory findings.Statistical AnalysisGiven that there are no existing published data on the effects of empagliflozin in combination with an ARB on nighttime BP in Japanese patients with T2DM and nocturnal hypertension, expected changes in BP during treatment for inclusion in the sample size calculation were taken from another trial of empagliflozin in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.18 Adjusted mean differences versus placebo in the change from baseline in mean 24-hour SBP were –4.18 mm Hg with empagliflozin 10 mg and –5.04 mm Hg with empagliflozin 25 mg. It was assumed that reductions in nighttime BP would be greater than those in mean 24-hour SBP, and therefore a between-group difference (empagliflozin versus placebo) was assumed for the mean change in the mean nighttime SBP of –5 mm Hg (with a SD of 10 mm Hg in each group). To detect differences between the 2 groups with 80% power, 63 patients in each group would be required (126 in total). Assuming that 20% of recruited patients would not meet the nighttime BP entry criteria and another 10% would be withdrawn during the treatment period, the enrollment target was 176 patients.Patients who were noncompliant with the Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Research were excluded from both efficacy and safety analyses. The full analysis set included all enrolled participants who received their assigned therapy at least once after randomization and who had made 24-hour ABPM recordings at least once. The safety analysis set included all randomized participants who had received the assigned therapy at least once during the study period. Efficacy analyses for BP values were conducted in the full analysis set, and safety was determined in the safety analysis set.Intergroup comparisons were tested with a t test for continuous variables, and Pearson χ2 test or Fisher exact test was used for dichotomous data. Mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis was used to compare the changes in nighttime BP, daytime BP, mean 24-hour ABPM BP, clinic BP, and HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Mixed-effects model repeated measures included the randomized study group, time point (0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks), interaction between the study group and time points as fixed effects, and age and sex as covariates. We used compound symmetry as the covariance structure.Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) at the Jichi Medical University Center of Global Home and Ambulatory BP Analysis, Shimotsuke, Japan. A 2-sided test was used; P values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsA total of 174 patients with diabetes mellitus and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension were screened between January and September 2017, of whom 132 met the inclusion criteria and were randomized (Figure 1). One patient in the placebo group withdrew because of protocol violation. Therefore, 131 patients were included in the full analysis set (68 in the empagliflozin group and 63 in the placebo group). There was an antihypertensive drug dosage increase in only 1 patient during the trial (in the placebo group). Baseline demographics and characteristics were well matched between the treatment groups (Table 1), apart from a higher baseline pulse rate in the placebo versus empagliflozin group (70.7±9.5 versus 67.1±8.3 beats/min; P=0.026).Table.

Study flow chart.Blood PressureThere was a significant reduction from baseline to week 12 in nighttime SBP with empagliflozin (–6.3 mm Hg; P=0.004) but not with placebo (–2.0 mm Hg; P=0.367); between-group difference was –4.3 (P=0.159; Figure 2). Reductions from baseline in daytime SBP and 24-hour SBP were also statistically significant in the empagliflozin group but not in the placebo group, with statistically significant between-group differences in the change from baseline (both P&lt;0.001; Figure 2). Changes in nighttime, daytime, and 24-hour DBP showed a similar pattern, all being significantly reduced from baseline by empagliflozin and not placebo, and significant between-group differences in the reduction from baseline for daytime and 24-hour DBP (Figure 2).Figure 2.

Significant reductions in uric acid and eGFR with empagliflozin versus placebo were evident after 4 weeks' treatment (Figure 4C and 4D).Figure 4.

P values are for the between-group difference change from baseline.At the 4-week follow-up, levels of NT-proBNP had reduced to a significantly greater extent in the empagliflozin versus placebo group (P=0.013), but at the 12-week follow-up, the between-group difference was no longer statistically significant (P=0.361; Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). Significantly greater reductions in atrial natriuretic peptide at both 4 and 12 weeks (Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement) and urinary albumin creatinine ratio at 12 weeks (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement) were seen with empagliflozin versus placebo.Pulse rates for each BP measurement were not significantly different between the empagliflozin and placebo groups (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement). In addition, the proportion of patients who changed antihypertensive medication during the study did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Lipid levels were also similar in the empagliflozin and placebo groups throughout the study (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).SafetyEmpagliflozin was well tolerated; no serious adverse events occurred during treatment, and there were no new safety signals. There were 4 adverse events in 4 patients in the placebo group and 14 events in 8 patients in the empagliflozin group. Of these, 7 events in the empagliflozin group (1 each of thirst, polyuria, lumbago, genital itching, fatigue, nausea, and constipation) and 1 in the placebo group (heartburn) were considered to be related to treatment. There were no episodes of hypotension, dehydration, urinary tract infection, or acute kidney injury.DiscussionThe SACRA study is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension despite ARB-based antihypertensive therapy. The addition of empagliflozin was associated with significant reductions from baseline in nighttime, clinic, 24-hour ambulatory, and morning home BP. Reductions in the majority of BP parameters were significantly better with empagliflozin versus placebo. The only parameter that did not reach statistical significance at 12 weeks with empagliflozin versus placebo was the reduction in nighttime BP. However, the numeric difference between the two treatments (–4.3 mm Hg) and the reduction from baseline with empagliflozin (–6.3 mm Hg) were of a magnitude that is likely to have important clinical implications given that a 5–mm Hg reduction in mean nighttime SBP has been independently associated with a 20% reduction in cardiovascular risk.19The home BP-lowering effects of empagliflozin in this high-risk population were also clinically meaningful because home BP-guided management of hypertension is the best approach in clinical practice.20 In the large, Japan-wide home BP registry-based HONEST study (Home Blood Pressure Measurement With Olmesartan-Naive Patients to Establish Standard Target Blood Pressure), on-treatment home BP was more closely associated with cardiovascular event risk than clinic BP.21 Morning home SBP after 12 weeks' treatment with empagliflozin in the current study was 126.6 mm Hg, close to the 124 mm Hg that was found to be the morning SBP associated with minimum cardiovascular risk in the HONEST study.21 In addition, reductions in morning home SBP (13.3 mm Hg) and clinic SBP (9.9 mm Hg) in the SACRA study were of a clinically relevant magnitude given that data from a meta-analysis showed that a 10 mm Hg reduction in clinic SBP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 20%, coronary heart disease by 27%, stroke by 27%, heart failure by 28%, and all-cause mortality by 13%.22 Based on available evidence, the cardiovascular risk associated with a ≥10–mm Hg reduction in home SBP would be greater than that achieved with a similar reduction in clinic SBP. This morning home BP reduction is particularly relevant in patients of Asian ethnicity who have been shown to have an exaggerated morning BP surge and morning hypertension compared with Western populations, and are at increased stroke risk.23–25Good reductions in daytime and 24-hour ambulatory BP were seen during empagliflozin therapy. This is notable given the elderly nature of the study population (mean age approximately 70 years). Consistent with the EMPA-REG BP trial results, we also noted slightly greater reductions in daytime compared with nighttime BP during empagliflozin therapy. Compared with the same empagliflozin dosage in the EMPA-REG BP trial (10 mg/d),18 reductions in 24-hour BP compared with placebo were greater in our study. Empagliflozin reduced 24-hour SBP by 7.7 mm Hg versus placebo compared with 3.44 mm Hg in the EMPA-REG BP trial; corresponding reductions in 24-hour DBP in the 2 trials were 2.9 and 1.36 mm Hg.18 Reasons for these differences are not clear. The majority of patients in the EMPA-REG BP trial (&gt;90%) were receiving concomitant antihypertensives, as was the case in our study. The rate of use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the EMPA-REG BP trial was &gt;75%, but there was no information on ARB use,18 whereas all patients in the current study were using an ARB. Nevertheless, reductions in BP with empagliflozin were found to be independent of concomitant antihypertensive use (number and type of agents) in an analysis of EMPA-REG BP data.26 Reductions in 24-hour BP in the current study were also greater than those from a meta-analysis of all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on 24-hour ambulatory BP (–3.76 and –1.83 mm Hg for 24-hour SBP and DBP, respectively).27Differences between trials in the reported BP reductions could be attributable to differences in the patient populations. Participants in the SACRA study were elderly (mean age approximately 70 years), had good glycemic control (mean HbA1c &lt;7.0%), and were selected based on the presence of nocturnal hypertension only. In addition, patient ethnicities differed between studies. All patients in the SACRA study were from Japan, compared with predominantly white populations in the previous trials. Japanese and Asian patients have a genetic predisposition to salt sensitivity and tend to have higher dietary salt intake.20,28,29 Despite these differences in patient characteristics, the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in Asian participants in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial were even greater and consistent with those in the overall patient population.30Nocturnal hypertension is a clinical phenotype of salt sensitivity, with higher blood pressures required to secrete sodium from the body. This increases stress on the left ventricle and the cerebral circulation, resulting in greater end-organ damage. It has been suggested that the BP-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors could be a result of their effects on osmotic diuresis and mild natriuresis,27,31 with a resulting reduction in preload.32 Osmotic diuresis might contribute to early decreases in BP during SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, with natriuresis playing a role in longer-term BP reductions.33 Significant reductions in the tissue sodium content of the skin have also been reported after 6 weeks' therapy with dapagliflozin.32 It has been suggested that greater reductions in daytime versus nighttime BP during SGLT2 inhibitor therapy may, at least in part, be a result of the glucose-dependent nature of glycemic control with these agents.27 Specifically, diuresis might be higher during daytime periods of higher glucose levels as a result of higher food and fluid intake. Conversely, smaller reductions in BP at nighttime with empagliflozin could be attributable to lower nocturnal urine production as a result of circadian rhythms in renal function. Circadian variations in sympathetic tone are another potential mechanism for the observed differences in diurnal and nighttime BP regulation by SGLT2 inhibitors. Additional research is needed to more clearly elucidate the specific mechanism of BP reduction with SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly in patients with cardiovascular high risk.In addition to glucose-lowering and antihypertensive effects, treatment with empagliflozin was also associated with significant reductions in body weight and uric acid compared with placebo, consistent with the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study.6–8 Even though baseline levels of NT-proBNP and atrial natriuretic peptide were within the normal range, these parameters were significantly reduced in patients receiving empagliflozin. Reductions in natriuretic peptides, even within the normal range, can have a clinically relevant beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk and mortality.34 In addition, the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased to a greater extent in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, the pattern of these effects seen for empagliflozin in this study, which enrolled an elderly population with slightly higher body mass index and good glycemic control, including the reductions in natriuretic peptides, without marked reduction in glucose, suggested that empagliflozin may be a useful therapeutic option in patients with heart failure who have similar characteristics.The eGFR reduction seen in empagliflozin recipients in this study was not progressive. In previous clinical studies, acute, reversible declines in eGFR with commensurate increases in serum creatinine have been observed with SGLT2 inhibitors, consistent with the hemodynamic effect of these agents. The initial decline in eGFR observed with SGLT2 inhibitors is likely related to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction through a tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism.35 Reduction of uric acid could be explained by the stimulating effects that SGLT2 inhibition has on excretion of uric acid by GLUT9 isoform 2 on the apical membrane of the proximal tubule and possible inhibition of uric acid reabsorption in the collecting ducts.36Study LimitationsThe most important limitation of our study is likely to be the lack of study power. Sample size calculations were based on a 5–mm Hg difference in nighttime BP between the treatment and placebo group, whereas the actual difference was 4.3 mm Hg. Lower-than-expected study power is the most likely explanation for the lack of statistical significance in the difference between empagliflozin and placebo in mean change in nighttime BP from baseline. In addition, the findings are only applicable to populations similar to those enrolled in the study, and need to be confirmed in patients of different ethnicities.ConclusionsThe SACRA study results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors offer a number of important benefits in T2DM and hypertension, and are therefore a valuable therapeutic option in these patients. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors to lower 24-hour BP in specific groups, such as those with nocturnal hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and high salt sensitivity, could help to reduce the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in these patients.AppendixSACRA study collaborators: Physicians: Satoshi Hoshide, Jichi Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan; Mitsuyoshi Yamamoto, Kotake Town Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan; Kazuo Eguchi, International University of Health and Welfare Hospital, Tochigi, Japan; Atsushi Mizuno, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Shigeru Nakano, Shiga Clinic, Ishikawa, Japan; Yuta Kemi, Ueno Village Clinic, Gumma, Japan; Research coordinators: Chie Iwashita, Jichi Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan; Kyouichi Wada, Satt Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; Azusa Kaneko, Satt Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; Medical writer: Nicola Ryan, independent medical writer.AcknowledgmentsWe acknowledge all the patients, physicians (Satoshi Hoshide, Mitsuyoshi Yamamoto, Kazuo Eguchi, Atsushi Mizuno, Shigeru Nakano, and Yuta Kemi), and medical staff who supported this study.

Twenty-Four-Hour Blood Pressure-Lowering Effect of a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor in Patients With Diabetes and Uncontrolled Nocturnal Hypertension | Circulation,"Clinical PerspectiveWhat Is New?Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, particularly when nighttime blood pressure is elevated.This is the first time that a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.The addition of empagliflozin to existing antihypertensive therapy was associated with significant reductions in a variety of blood pressure measures, including ambulatory and home blood pressure.What Are the Clinical Implications?There is a growing body of data supporting the important benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.The reductions in blood pressure that occurred after the addition of empagliflozin therapy were of a clinically relevant magnitude that would be expected to reduce cardiovascular risk, and occurred in patients already receiving antihypertensive therapy (including angiotensin receptor blockers).IntroductionEditorial, see p 2110Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral hypoglycemic agents that act primarily by increasing the urinary elimination of glucose.1 In addition to reducing blood glucose, treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin has also been associated with weight loss and reductions in blood pressure (BP).2–5 In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (BI 10773 [Empagliflozin] Cardiovascular Blood Pressure Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and high cardiovascular risk with empagliflozin versus placebo significantly reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, heart failure–related hospitalizations, and progression of diabetic nephropathy.6–8 Although clinic BP was reduced by empagliflozin, the contribution of decreases in 24-hour BP, including nocturnal and morning time periods, to the observed benefit on cardiovascular outcomes could not be determined. In particular, nocturnal hypertension, or the nondipper pattern of nighttime BP, is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease including nonischemic heart failure, both in patients with hypertension and in the general population.9–11The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is also increased in T2DM patients.12 The cardiovascular disease and mortality risk are particularly high in T2DM patients with nocturnal hypertension.13–15 This highlights the importance of nighttime BP as a cardiovascular and mortality risk factor in patients with T2DM, and suggests that nighttime BP could be an important therapeutic target in these patients.The SACRA study (SGLT2 inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker [ARB] Combination Therapy in Patients With Diabetes and Uncontrolled Nocturnal Hypertension) used ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) to investigate the effects of adding empagliflozin to existing antihypertensive therapy on nighttime BP in T2DM patients and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension.MethodsThe SACRA study (NCT03050229) was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel group trial conducted in Japan. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Jichi Medical University School of Medicine. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, International on Harmonization Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment into the study.The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure.ParticipantsEligible patients were aged ≥20 years; had T2DM (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥6% and &lt;10%), seated clinic systolic BP (SBP) 130 to 159 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) 80 to 99 mm Hg, and nocturnal hypertension (SBP ≥115 mm Hg at 2, 3, and 4 a.m. during sleep 5 days before randomization, measured using home BP monitoring [HEM-7080-IC; Omron Healthcare Co Ltd, Kyoto, Japan]); were receiving stable antidiabetic treatment with or without antidiabetics for ≥8 weeks before baseline; and were receiving stable antihypertensive treatment that included an ARB for ≥8 weeks before baseline. Key exclusion criteria included history of diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic coma, renal and liver damage, and cardiovascular disease events (within 3 months before randomization; Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).Randomized TreatmentAfter an 8-week run-in period, eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated, pseudorandom sequence and was stratified by nighttime SBP, age, sex, and study center. Antihypertensive and antidiabetic medication could be changed at the discretion of the investigator.AssessmentsStudy visits were scheduled at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. Morning home BP monitoring using a validated BP monitoring device (HEM-7080-IC) was performed for 5 consecutive days before each study visit. Clinic BP was measured at each study visit. Twenty-four-hour ABPM was performed at baseline and week 12, after administration of study medication, using methods described previously.16 In brief, an automatic oscillometric method ABPM device (TM2431; A&amp;D Co, Tokyo, Japan) was used to record BP and pulse rate every 30 minutes for 24 hours. Twenty-four-hour BP was defined as the average of all readings over a 24-hour period. Nighttime BP was calculated as the average of BP values recorded over the period from when the patient went to bed until the patient got up; values over the rest of the day were used to calculate daytime BP. Investigators were unaware of glucose results during the entire treatment period. Safety was assessed based on laboratory findings, and the occurrence of adverse events and side effects documented during study visits.OutcomesThe primary efficacy end point was change from baseline in nighttime SBP and DBP measured using ABPM. Key secondary end points were change from baseline in mean 24-hour SBP/DBP and daytime BP at week 12. Other secondary efficacy end points were change from baseline to week 12 in morning home BP, clinic BP, HbA1c, and body weight. Additional end points were low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide) levels, atrial natriuretic peptide levels, magnesium levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR: men, 194×serum creatinine-1.094×age-0.287; women, 194× serum creatinine -1.094×age-0.287×0.739),17 urinary albumin creatinine ratio, and laboratory findings.Statistical AnalysisGiven that there are no existing published data on the effects of empagliflozin in combination with an ARB on nighttime BP in Japanese patients with T2DM and nocturnal hypertension, expected changes in BP during treatment for inclusion in the sample size calculation were taken from another trial of empagliflozin in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.18 Adjusted mean differences versus placebo in the change from baseline in mean 24-hour SBP were –4.18 mm Hg with empagliflozin 10 mg and –5.04 mm Hg with empagliflozin 25 mg. It was assumed that reductions in nighttime BP would be greater than those in mean 24-hour SBP, and therefore a between-group difference (empagliflozin versus placebo) was assumed for the mean change in the mean nighttime SBP of –5 mm Hg (with a SD of 10 mm Hg in each group). To detect differences between the 2 groups with 80% power, 63 patients in each group would be required (126 in total). Assuming that 20% of recruited patients would not meet the nighttime BP entry criteria and another 10% would be withdrawn during the treatment period, the enrollment target was 176 patients.Patients who were noncompliant with the Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Research were excluded from both efficacy and safety analyses. The full analysis set included all enrolled participants who received their assigned therapy at least once after randomization and who had made 24-hour ABPM recordings at least once. The safety analysis set included all randomized participants who had received the assigned therapy at least once during the study period. Efficacy analyses for BP values were conducted in the full analysis set, and safety was determined in the safety analysis set.Intergroup comparisons were tested with a t test for continuous variables, and Pearson χ2 test or Fisher exact test was used for dichotomous data. Mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis was used to compare the changes in nighttime BP, daytime BP, mean 24-hour ABPM BP, clinic BP, and HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Mixed-effects model repeated measures included the randomized study group, time point (0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks), interaction between the study group and time points as fixed effects, and age and sex as covariates. We used compound symmetry as the covariance structure.Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) at the Jichi Medical University Center of Global Home and Ambulatory BP Analysis, Shimotsuke, Japan. A 2-sided test was used; P values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsA total of 174 patients with diabetes mellitus and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension were screened between January and September 2017, of whom 132 met the inclusion criteria and were randomized (Figure 1). One patient in the placebo group withdrew because of protocol violation. Therefore, 131 patients were included in the full analysis set (68 in the empagliflozin group and 63 in the placebo group). There was an antihypertensive drug dosage increase in only 1 patient during the trial (in the placebo group). Baseline demographics and characteristics were well matched between the treatment groups (Table 1), apart from a higher baseline pulse rate in the placebo versus empagliflozin group (70.7±9.5 versus 67.1±8.3 beats/min; P=0.026).Table.

Study flow chart.Blood PressureThere was a significant reduction from baseline to week 12 in nighttime SBP with empagliflozin (–6.3 mm Hg; P=0.004) but not with placebo (–2.0 mm Hg; P=0.367); between-group difference was –4.3 (P=0.159; Figure 2). Reductions from baseline in daytime SBP and 24-hour SBP were also statistically significant in the empagliflozin group but not in the placebo group, with statistically significant between-group differences in the change from baseline (both P&lt;0.001; Figure 2). Changes in nighttime, daytime, and 24-hour DBP showed a similar pattern, all being significantly reduced from baseline by empagliflozin and not placebo, and significant between-group differences in the reduction from baseline for daytime and 24-hour DBP (Figure 2).Figure 2.

Significant reductions in uric acid and eGFR with empagliflozin versus placebo were evident after 4 weeks' treatment (Figure 4C and 4D).Figure 4.

Points and bar represent the least-square mean and standard error using the mixed-effects model with repeated measures adjusted for age and sex. P values are for the between-group difference change from baseline.At the 4-week follow-up, levels of NT-proBNP had reduced to a significantly greater extent in the empagliflozin versus placebo group (P=0.013), but at the 12-week follow-up, the between-group difference was no longer statistically significant (P=0.361; Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). Significantly greater reductions in atrial natriuretic peptide at both 4 and 12 weeks (Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement) and urinary albumin creatinine ratio at 12 weeks (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement) were seen with empagliflozin versus placebo.Pulse rates for each BP measurement were not significantly different between the empagliflozin and placebo groups (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement). In addition, the proportion of patients who changed antihypertensive medication during the study did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Lipid levels were also similar in the empagliflozin and placebo groups throughout the study (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).SafetyEmpagliflozin was well tolerated; no serious adverse events occurred during treatment, and there were no new safety signals. There were 4 adverse events in 4 patients in the placebo group and 14 events in 8 patients in the empagliflozin group. Of these, 7 events in the empagliflozin group (1 each of thirst, polyuria, lumbago, genital itching, fatigue, nausea, and constipation) and 1 in the placebo group (heartburn) were considered to be related to treatment. There were no episodes of hypotension, dehydration, urinary tract infection, or acute kidney injury.DiscussionThe SACRA study is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension despite ARB-based antihypertensive therapy. The addition of empagliflozin was associated with significant reductions from baseline in nighttime, clinic, 24-hour ambulatory, and morning home BP. Reductions in the majority of BP parameters were significantly better with empagliflozin versus placebo. The only parameter that did not reach statistical significance at 12 weeks with empagliflozin versus placebo was the reduction in nighttime BP. However, the numeric difference between the two treatments (–4.3 mm Hg) and the reduction from baseline with empagliflozin (–6.3 mm Hg) were of a magnitude that is likely to have important clinical implications given that a 5–mm Hg reduction in mean nighttime SBP has been independently associated with a 20% reduction in cardiovascular risk.19The home BP-lowering effects of empagliflozin in this high-risk population were also clinically meaningful because home BP-guided management of hypertension is the best approach in clinical practice.20 In the large, Japan-wide home BP registry-based HONEST study (Home Blood Pressure Measurement With Olmesartan-Naive Patients to Establish Standard Target Blood Pressure), on-treatment home BP was more closely associated with cardiovascular event risk than clinic BP.21 Morning home SBP after 12 weeks' treatment with empagliflozin in the current study was 126.6 mm Hg, close to the 124 mm Hg that was found to be the morning SBP associated with minimum cardiovascular risk in the HONEST study.21 In addition, reductions in morning home SBP (13.3 mm Hg) and clinic SBP (9.9 mm Hg) in the SACRA study were of a clinically relevant magnitude given that data from a meta-analysis showed that a 10 mm Hg reduction in clinic SBP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 20%, coronary heart disease by 27%, stroke by 27%, heart failure by 28%, and all-cause mortality by 13%.22 Based on available evidence, the cardiovascular risk associated with a ≥10–mm Hg reduction in home SBP would be greater than that achieved with a similar reduction in clinic SBP. This morning home BP reduction is particularly relevant in patients of Asian ethnicity who have been shown to have an exaggerated morning BP surge and morning hypertension compared with Western populations, and are at increased stroke risk.23–25Good reductions in daytime and 24-hour ambulatory BP were seen during empagliflozin therapy. This is notable given the elderly nature of the study population (mean age approximately 70 years). Consistent with the EMPA-REG BP trial results, we also noted slightly greater reductions in daytime compared with nighttime BP during empagliflozin therapy. Compared with the same empagliflozin dosage in the EMPA-REG BP trial (10 mg/d),18 reductions in 24-hour BP compared with placebo were greater in our study. Empagliflozin reduced 24-hour SBP by 7.7 mm Hg versus placebo compared with 3.44 mm Hg in the EMPA-REG BP trial; corresponding reductions in 24-hour DBP in the 2 trials were 2.9 and 1.36 mm Hg.18 Reasons for these differences are not clear. The majority of patients in the EMPA-REG BP trial (&gt;90%) were receiving concomitant antihypertensives, as was the case in our study. The rate of use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the EMPA-REG BP trial was &gt;75%, but there was no information on ARB use,18 whereas all patients in the current study were using an ARB. Nevertheless, reductions in BP with empagliflozin were found to be independent of concomitant antihypertensive use (number and type of agents) in an analysis of EMPA-REG BP data.26 Reductions in 24-hour BP in the current study were also greater than those from a meta-analysis of all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on 24-hour ambulatory BP (–3.76 and –1.83 mm Hg for 24-hour SBP and DBP, respectively).27Differences between trials in the reported BP reductions could be attributable to differences in the patient populations. Participants in the SACRA study were elderly (mean age approximately 70 years), had good glycemic control (mean HbA1c &lt;7.0%), and were selected based on the presence of nocturnal hypertension only. In addition, patient ethnicities differed between studies. All patients in the SACRA study were from Japan, compared with predominantly white populations in the previous trials. Japanese and Asian patients have a genetic predisposition to salt sensitivity and tend to have higher dietary salt intake.20,28,29 Despite these differences in patient characteristics, the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in Asian participants in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial were even greater and consistent with those in the overall patient population.30Nocturnal hypertension is a clinical phenotype of salt sensitivity, with higher blood pressures required to secrete sodium from the body. This increases stress on the left ventricle and the cerebral circulation, resulting in greater end-organ damage. It has been suggested that the BP-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors could be a result of their effects on osmotic diuresis and mild natriuresis,27,31 with a resulting reduction in preload.32 Osmotic diuresis might contribute to early decreases in BP during SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, with natriuresis playing a role in longer-term BP reductions.33 Significant reductions in the tissue sodium content of the skin have also been reported after 6 weeks' therapy with dapagliflozin.32 It has been suggested that greater reductions in daytime versus nighttime BP during SGLT2 inhibitor therapy may, at least in part, be a result of the glucose-dependent nature of glycemic control with these agents.27 Specifically, diuresis might be higher during daytime periods of higher glucose levels as a result of higher food and fluid intake. Conversely, smaller reductions in BP at nighttime with empagliflozin could be attributable to lower nocturnal urine production as a result of circadian rhythms in renal function. Circadian variations in sympathetic tone are another potential mechanism for the observed differences in diurnal and nighttime BP regulation by SGLT2 inhibitors. Additional research is needed to more clearly elucidate the specific mechanism of BP reduction with SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly in patients with cardiovascular high risk.In addition to glucose-lowering and antihypertensive effects, treatment with empagliflozin was also associated with significant reductions in body weight and uric acid compared with placebo, consistent with the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study.6–8 Even though baseline levels of NT-proBNP and atrial natriuretic peptide were within the normal range, these parameters were significantly reduced in patients receiving empagliflozin. Reductions in natriuretic peptides, even within the normal range, can have a clinically relevant beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk and mortality.34 In addition, the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased to a greater extent in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, the pattern of these effects seen for empagliflozin in this study, which enrolled an elderly population with slightly higher body mass index and good glycemic control, including the reductions in natriuretic peptides, without marked reduction in glucose, suggested that empagliflozin may be a useful therapeutic option in patients with heart failure who have similar characteristics.The eGFR reduction seen in empagliflozin recipients in this study was not progressive. In previous clinical studies, acute, reversible declines in eGFR with commensurate increases in serum creatinine have been observed with SGLT2 inhibitors, consistent with the hemodynamic effect of these agents. The initial decline in eGFR observed with SGLT2 inhibitors is likely related to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction through a tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism.35 Reduction of uric acid could be explained by the stimulating effects that SGLT2 inhibition has on excretion of uric acid by GLUT9 isoform 2 on the apical membrane of the proximal tubule and possible inhibition of uric acid reabsorption in the collecting ducts.36Study LimitationsThe most important limitation of our study is likely to be the lack of study power. Sample size calculations were based on a 5–mm Hg difference in nighttime BP between the treatment and placebo group, whereas the actual difference was 4.3 mm Hg. Lower-than-expected study power is the most likely explanation for the lack of statistical significance in the difference between empagliflozin and placebo in mean change in nighttime BP from baseline. In addition, the findings are only applicable to populations similar to those enrolled in the study, and need to be confirmed in patients of different ethnicities.ConclusionsThe SACRA study results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors offer a number of important benefits in T2DM and hypertension, and are therefore a valuable therapeutic option in these patients. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors to lower 24-hour BP in specific groups, such as those with nocturnal hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and high salt sensitivity, could help to reduce the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in these patients.AppendixSACRA study collaborators: Physicians: Satoshi Hoshide, Jichi Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan; Mitsuyoshi Yamamoto, Kotake Town Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan; Kazuo Eguchi, International University of Health and Welfare Hospital, Tochigi, Japan; Atsushi Mizuno, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Shigeru Nakano, Shiga Clinic, Ishikawa, Japan; Yuta Kemi, Ueno Village Clinic, Gumma, Japan; Research coordinators: Chie Iwashita, Jichi Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan; Kyouichi Wada, Satt Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; Azusa Kaneko, Satt Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; Medical writer: Nicola Ryan, independent medical writer.AcknowledgmentsWe acknowledge all the patients, physicians (Satoshi Hoshide, Mitsuyoshi Yamamoto, Kazuo Eguchi, Atsushi Mizuno, Shigeru Nakano, and Yuta Kemi), and medical staff who supported this study.

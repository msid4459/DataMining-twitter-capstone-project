Should Certain Antihyperglycemic Medications Be Preferred Over Antihypertensive Medications for Blood Pressure Control in Special Populations With Diabetes Mellitus? | Circulation,"Articles, see p 2089 and p 2098Hypertension affects approximately two-thirds of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Moreover, it synergistically increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is interesting to note that there is evidence to suggest that controlling blood pressure (BP) will reduce more cardiovascular disease (CVD) events than glycemic control alone.1,2 The ACCORD trial (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) assessed the effects of optimal glycemic and BP targets, and lipid management in 10 000 patients with DM. Only the randomized comparison of BP management (and not the glycemic or lipid arms) demonstrated cardiovascular benefit.3 A newer class of DM medication, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, specifically, empagliflozin (EMPA), has been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes, and is currently undergoing randomized trial evaluation in patients with chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. In this issue of Circulation, there are 2 reports on the BP-lowering effects of EMPA in 2 very different special populations (patients at greater risk for CVD who may derive unique benefit from the mechanism of BP reduction associated with EMPA). Both reports converge to suggest that EMPA produces reductions in BP of sufficient magnitude to confer reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.In this issue, Ferdinand et al4 demonstrate that 25 mg of EMPA reduces 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 8.5 mm Hg (placebo corrected). The confidence interval suggested an effect as large as 13.7 mm Hg and a minimum effect of 3 mm Hg. However, because glycemic control was the primary end point of the study, the robustness of the BP results was not fully examined because the sensitivity analyses were limited to the primary aim. About 10% of the randomly assigned patients were not included in the efficacy analysis. The effects of missing data are smoothed out by carrying forward the last observed data point. Despite the limitations, the authors were able to reveal reductions in BP in 72 blacks with DM. Ferdinand et al reported a high drug adherence rate of &gt;92%, suggesting that EMPA was a highly acceptable add-on therapy. Study participants were concomitantly being treated with antihypertensive medication; moreover, one-third would be considered treatment-resistant patients (on ≥3 antihypertensive medications). In the PATHWAY-2 trial (Optimum Treatment for Drug-Resistant Hypertension), Williams et al5 found spironolactone to be superior to either a β- or α-blocker as a fourth-line add-on agent in the treatment of resistant hypertension, reporting a mean reduction of 8.7 mm Hg in home SBP. The results of Ferdinand et al should compel a follow-up study in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. To date, clinicians seeking an antihypertensive agent to use as a fourth-line add-on drug to existing medications in patients with DM would be challenged to identify a drug with either the efficacy or tolerability demonstrated with EMPA in this report.Use of 24-hour ambulatory monitoring of BP allows for the capture of other important information, more specifically, the frequently reported excess incidence of blunted nocturnal decline in BP and nighttime hypertension in blacks with its associated excess morbidity and mortality. Ferdinand et al show that 25 mg of EMPA significantly reduces nighttime BP by 6 mm Hg. Thus, EMPA may be an effective agent to target nighttime hypertension.In this issue, the effects of EMPA on nocturnal BP are specifically addressed in the report by Kario et al.6 The investigators recruited Japanese patients with DM and uncontrolled nighttime BP on therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade. Kario et al posit that Japanese patients with DM and with nighttime hypertension were more likely to be salt sensitive and might derive particular benefit from treatment with EMPA. Although the primary aim of the trial was not achieved, in that there was not a significant reduction in the nighttime BP with 10 mg of EMPA in comparison with the placebo control group after 12 weeks of observation, the investigators observed significant reductions in 24-hour mean SBP of 7.7 mm Hg (and significant reductions in several other BP parameters). These results are consistent with Ferdinand et al. Kario et al had no preliminary data on which to calculate study power for the primary aim (nighttime SBP reduction). They expected a nighttime reduction of 5 mm Hg, but observed only a 4.7–mm Hg reduction. The observation period of 12 weeks was adequate to show an effect of 10 mg of EMPA, whereas Ferdinand et al found additional BP reduction between 12 and 24 weeks of observation using the 25-mg dose.Kawasoe et al7 investigated putative mechanisms of the BP-lowering effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors using 24-hour urinary collections and comparing the changes in urinary data with changes in SBP at baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months of administration of the various SGLT-2 inhibitors in outpatients from the Uenomachi-Kajiya Clinic (Kagoshima, Japan). The investigators found that SBP was significantly decreased at 1 month after administration of SGLT-2 inhibitors. The decrease in SBP at 1 month was accompanied by an increase in urinary volume and urinary excretion of both glucose and sodium. However, SBP continued to decrease up to 6 months after administration of SGLT-2 inhibitors. In contrast with the observations at 1 month, the decrease in SBP at 6 months was not correlated with increases in urinary glucose excretion. Instead, the 6-month SBP reduction was correlated with the increase in urinary sodium excretion, suggesting that the BP-lowering effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors at 6 months derives mainly from plasma volume reduction because of a natriuretic effect. These observations suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors may exert both acute and longer-term effects on BP. It is possible that the results reported by both Ferdinand and Kario may have been more robust with additional follow-up time.Before the 2 current reports in this issue of Circulation, the magnitude of BP reduction in previous trials with SGLT-2 inhibitors in diabetic populations with and without hypertension was much less robust. Baker et al8 performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to investigate the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on 24-hour ambulatory BP. SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly reduce 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP by −3.76 mm Hg (95% CI, −4.23 to −2.34) and −1.83 mm Hg (95% CI, −2.35 to −1.31), respectively.The CVD risk reduction associated with casual office measures has been estimated by Ettehad et al9 with a meta-analysis of randomized drug trials (normalized with observational data); for every 10 mm Hg reduction in SBP, the risk of major cardiovascular disease events is reduced by 20% (relative risk [RR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77–0.83), coronary heart disease is reduced by 17% (0.83; 0.78–0.88), stroke reduction by 27% (0.73; 0.68–0.77), heart failure by 28% (0.72; 0.67–0.78), and a reduction in all-cause mortality by 13% (0.87; 0.84–0.91). Similar estimates for reduction in CVD risk are not readily available for 24-hour mean reductions in SBP, but, given that 24-hour mean BP better predicts CVD risk,10 one might expect the reductions observed by both Ferdinand et al and Kario et al to confer greater reduction in CVD events in comparison with casual office readings.Both Ferdinand et al and Kario et al report SBP reductions that nearly double the mean reductions from the Baker et al meta-analysis. Kario et al provided a discussion of the differences in the magnitude of reduction in BP between Japanese subjects in the current report with those observed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study (BI 10773 [Empagliflozin] Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients).11 There are insufficient data to fully explain why the 2 special populations treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors enjoy clinically more robust BP reductions. It is noteworthy, however, that both groups of investigators sought a special population believed to be more responsive to natriuresis when designing their trials. Although there are many differences between Japanese subjects residing in Japan and blacks, they do converge on a phenotype of salt sensitivity, elevated nighttime SBP, and excess hypertension-related cardiovascular risk.In summary, EMPA has been associated with CVD risk reduction in patients with DM at high cardiovascular risk. The mechanism of this benefit has not been fully elucidated. In the reports from Kario et al and Ferdinand et al in this issue of Circulation, the authors identify populations with a phenotype of hypertension that appears to enjoy clinically significant BP reduction, an accepted proxy for reduction in CVD event rates. Although SGLT-2 inhibitors are not currently considered first-line agents in the treatment of DM in the general population, it may be time to rethink the approach to patients with both hypertension and DM. There are a number of agents that confer similar reductions in glycemic control. However newer agents, incretins (laraglutide and semagluitide), SGLT-2 inhibitors (canaglifozin and dapaglifozin), and a SGLT-1/2 inhibitor (sotagliflozin) are currently engaged in randomized trials assessing CVD events in patients with and without DM. Results from these trials may challenge conventional recommendations for diabetes management. Although admittedly additional data are needed on the SGLT-2 drug class in terms of both safety and efficacy, certain subgroups (those with salt sensitivity) may benefit from rethinking the current strategy of preferring glycemic agents with much less promise for CVD risk reduction when treating patients with both hypertension and DM.FootnotesThe opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the editors or of the American Heart Association.https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/circKenneth A.

Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy,"AbstractBackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide, but few effective long-term treatments are available. In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.MethodsIn this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to &lt;90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], &gt;300 to 5000) and were treated with renin–angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of &lt;15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.ResultsThe trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. At that time, 4401 patients had undergone randomization, with a median follow-up of 2.62 years. The relative risk of the primary outcome was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.82; P=0.00001). The relative risk of the renal-specific composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the creatinine level, or death from renal causes was lower by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P&lt;0.001), and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was lower by 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.86; P=0.002). The canagliflozin group also had a lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; P=0.01) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of amputation or fracture.ConclusionsIn patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events was lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 2.62 years.

FDA Response to Sotagliflozin 'Disappointing',"This transcript has been edited for clarity. Today I'm going to discuss sotagliflozin and how it recently received a complete response letter from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Basically, sotagliflozin is not going to be approved for use in the US market anytime soon. I don't have the results of what the FDA is thinking, but I'd like to comment on the basis of my own experience, having been at the FDA for the hearing, and talk about the future of SGLT inhibitor therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. What I'm about to discuss is all off-label use. I have been using SGLT2 inhibitors off-label for the management of my patients with type 1 diabetes, pretty much since the drugs came out. I'm well aware of the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, having published about this risk[1] early on. The reason I believe in using SGLT inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes is because of how much better my patients feel. They really feel like these drugs help them control their diabetes and reduce some of the variability that they live with as they go through their days. So, my entire reason for supporting the FDA approval of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes is based on what my patients say about how well these drugs work. The nonnumeric, hard-to-quantitate impact of SGLT inhibitors may have gotten lost in translation. When I was at the FDA hearing, it seemed to me that the panel was not fully understanding people's experiences living with type 1 diabetes. Although a number of people spoke about this, it wasn't as impactful as some of the things that biostatisticians look at, such as changes in A1c, hypoglycemia, or anything that's numeric. Half of the panel was endocrinologists and a patient voice. And then there were cardiologists and others on the panel. One of the things that might have gotten lost in translation is the nonnumeric, hard-to-quantitate impact of SGLT inhibitors. Obviously, the other side to it is the risk. These drugs in clinical trials have increased the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes. It also happens in people with type 2 diabetes, but much more rarely. However, none of the clinical trials were done with a careful risk-mitigation plan. I have very specific things that I do to help reduce the risk in my patients, and frankly, it's worked very well for me. I'd love to see it as part of a larger ongoing study. I truly believe that the FDA could create a pathway whereby we restrict initial use of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes to endocrinologists and patients who fit certain criteria. What I Do in My Practice So, what are my criteria? First is that the patient is doing reasonably well on insulin. I don't use these agents in patients whose A1c is &gt; 9. Then I have patients monitor their ketones, whether it's fingerstick or urine ketones. I tend to use fingerstick ketones because I'm used to it. I have patients do this for a week or two before they actually start on the active drug, to make sure that they aren't ketotic when starting on an SGLT inhibitor and to help patients get used to ketone testing. My patients give me baseline ketone levels. I think patients should be required to have normal or very minimally elevated ketone levels before starting on an agent, because that shows you that they are on enough insulin to inhibit ketosis at baseline. I tend to start with a low dose of the SGLT inhibitor. It may be half a tablet; I'm very conservative. I don't have my patients reduce their insulin by much early on, and I have them continue daily ketone monitoring until I get them to where I want, with a stable dose of insulin and a stable dose of the SGLT inhibitor. I speak with my patients every week and I follow their ketones. After they've uptitrated the SGLT inhibitor and, in many cases, reduced their insulin to some degree, I make sure that they're stable, without a marked increase in ketone levels. Let's say that somebody's baseline ketones on fingerstick are 0 to 0.1 or 0.2. You'll see a little bit of an increase, to 0.2 or 0.3. But my threshold is that my patients have to be at a serum ketone level of &lt; 0.6 for me to start the agent. If they go above 0.6 after starting on the agent, I may need to further intensify their insulin therapy, making sure that I'm giving them enough carbohydrates and insulin. Lots of Education Then I give them a handout and lots of lessons on when to stop the SGLT2 inhibitor—for any sickness, procedure, dehydration, or intense exercise. We really work on that. At every 3-month follow-up visit, I ensure that they have ketone testing supplies available, that they know how to use them, and that they know what would happen if they develop ketones—specifically, that they'd stop the SGLT inhibitor and take more insulin and carbohydrate. At annual visits, I again make absolutely certain that they're prepared and know when to stop the agents. Over time, people get very used to being on the agent—I have patients now who've been on an SGLT2 inhibitor for 3 or 4 years, and they've done really well. But I want to make sure that they remember to stop taking it if they get sick, so I reinforce that. I try to do it at every visit, but I make sure at an annual visit that they're prepared. If we have a stepwise approach and a way of monitoring patients as SGLT inhibitors become available for patients with type 1 diabetes, we can make sure that patients do this safely. I was disappointed that sotagliflozin didn't get approved this time around, but I'm optimistic that this therapy would be a very useful tool in the management of type 1 diabetes. I really hope that there's ongoing development for the adjunctive use of sotagliflozin in the management of type 1 diabetes. Thank you.

"Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular, renal and safety outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease: A syste... - PubMed - NCBI","AbstractAIM: The use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been limited, primarily because glycaemic efficacy is dependent on kidney function. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and CKD, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 .MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library until 7 August 2018 and websites of the US, European and Japanese regulatory authorities until 27 July 2018 for data from randomized controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors that included reporting of effects on biomarkers, cardiovascular, renal or safety outcomes in individuals with T2DM and CKD. Random effects models and inverse variance weighting were used to calculate relative risks with 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS: Data were obtained from 27 studies with up to 7363 participants involved. In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors lowered glycated haemoglobin (-0.29%; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.19) as well as blood pressure, body weight and albuminuria. SGLT2 inhibition reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94) and heart failure (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48-0.78), without a clear effect on all-cause mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73-1.01). These agents also attenuated the annual decline in eGFR slope (placebo-subtracted difference of 1.35 mL/1.73 m2 /y; 95% CI, 0.78-1.93) and reduced the risk of the composite renal outcome (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.95). There was no evidence of additional risks with SGLT2 inhibition in CKD beyond those already known for the class, although heterogeneity was observed across individual agents for some safety outcomes.CONCLUSION: Currently available data suggest that, despite only modest reductions in glycated haemoglobin, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM and CKD, without clear evidence of additional safety concerns.© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",https://t.co/HYQbAdsNvB,others
SGLT2 inhibitors,"SGLT2 inhibitors are a class of diabetes medication prevents the body to reabsorb glucose, increasing glucose excretions in urine to lower blood-glucose level.SGLT2 inhibitorsSGLT2 inhibitors are sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors; it blocks the reabsorption of glucose into body by the kidney and increasing glucose excretions in urine. It is not recommendable for patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.SGLT2 inhibitors mechanism of actionSGLT2 is a protein in humans that facilitates glucose reabsorption in the kidney. SGLT2 is responsible for almost 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Inhibiting this transporter leads to the decrease in blood glucose due to the increase in renal glucose excretion.The mechanism of action of this new class of drugs also offers further glucose control by allowing increased insulin sensitivity and uptake of glucose in the muscle cells, decreased gluconeogenesis and improved first phase insulin release from the beta cells.Drugs in the SGLT2 inhibitors classGeneric name: Canagliflozin (Brand name: Invokana),Generic name: Dapagliflozin (Brand name: Farxiga (in US), Forxiga (in EU)),Generic name: Ipragliflozin (Brand name: Suglat)SGLT2 inhibitors dosageCanagliflozin – start with a minimum dose of 100 mg once daily for eGFR 45 to &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, maximum dose of up to 300 mg once daily is allowable for patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2.Dapagliflozin - start with a minimum dose of 5 mg orally one a day; take in the morning with or without food. You may increase to 10 mg once a day in patients tolerating 5 mg/day who have an eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m² and require additional glycemic control.Ipragliflozin - The recommended dose is 50 mg once daily, in the morning. If the effects are insufficient, the dosage may increase to up to 100 mg once a day, while carefully monitoring disease progress.SGLT2 can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue.What you can expect from SGLT2 inhibitors?SGLT2 inhibitors as a mono-therapy can reduce HbA1c levels. You can use SGLT2 inhibitors as a mono-therapy or in combination with most other oral diabetes drugs and insulin.Possible side effects of SGLT2 inhibitorsSGLT2 inhibitors can increase LDL cholesterol, urinary tract infections, genital mycotic infections, and associated with increased urination and episodes of hypotension and low blood-glucose (or hypoglycemia). The same report did show that the drug decreased weight by a 1.9 to 3% as well as decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures and raised HDL cholesterol. Some common side effects are rapid weight loss, tiredness, and dehydration.Who should avoid using SGLT2 inhibitors?Avoid SGLT2 inhibitors, if you areType 1 diabetesPeople with low kidney functionPeople taking strong diuretic medication",https://t.co/VdLI74iJfu,others
SGLT2 Inhibitors,"This special series of reviews focuses on the newest class of glucose-lowering agents, the sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors. Rieg and Vallon begin the series by tracing the development of the SGLT inhibitor class of drugs, including SGLT1 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors and dual inhibitors. Wright and colleagues go on to discuss the mechanisms of actions of these drugs; they explain that SGLT1 and SGLT2 (and GLUT2) are key players in renal glucose transport and describe how inhibition of either SGLT2 or SGLT1 promotes glucose excretion in the urine. However, as discussed by Thomas and Cherney, SGLT inhibitors not only affect glucose metabolism, but also adiposity, renal function and blood pressure in type 2 diabetes. In terms of their pleiotropic actions, the most striking results so far come from SGLT2 inhibitor studies investigating the cardiovascular effects of these drugs. In their review, Verma and McMurray outline the proposed mechanisms underpinning the unprecedented benefit of reduced cardiovascular disease risk with SGLT2 inhibitor use, observed in people with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Despite their glucose-lowering ability, pleiotropic effects and potential cardioprotective outcomes, the place of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of type 2 diabetes is still hotly debated. To explain why, Lupsa and Inzucchi review the benefits and adverse effects of SGLT2 inhibitors approved for use in the USA and Europe in individuals with type 2 diabetes. What about individuals with type 1 diabetes? Research is much sparser in this area but McCrimmon and Henry discuss the results of two recent 24 week Phase III randomised controlled clinical trials, inTandem3 and DEPICT-1, which studied sotagliflozin (a dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor) and dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor), respectively. Wanner and Marx conclude the series by discussing SGLT2 inhibitors in the context of the future of diabetes therapy. They also discuss the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on other chronic diseases and outline future treatment strategies. This review set is accompanied by an editorial by Sally Marshall.Read an article exploring the historical origins of SGLT2 by Viktor Jörgens here.",https://t.co/GOmK9oxClW,others

The relative risk of the primary outcome was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.82; P=0.00001). The relative risk of the renal-specific composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the creatinine level, or death from renal causes was lower by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P&lt;0.001), and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was lower by 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.86; P=0.002). The canagliflozin group also had a lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; P=0.01) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of amputation or fracture.ConclusionsIn patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events was lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 2.62 years.

Empagliflozin and the Risk of Heart Failure Hospitalization in Routine Clinical Care: A First Analysis from the Empagliflozin Comparative Effectiveness and Safety (EMPRISE) Study | Circulation,"Background: The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), reduces the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) by 35%, on top of standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established CV disease (CVD). The EMPagliflozin compaRative effectIveness and SafEty (EMPRISE) study aims to assess empagliflozin's effectiveness, safety, and healthcare utilization in routine care from 08/2014 through 09/2019. In this first interim analysis, we investigated the risk of HHF among T2D patients initiating empagliflozin vs. sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i). Methods: Within two commercial and one federal (Medicare) claims data sources in the U.S., we identified a 1:1 propensity-score (PS) matched cohort of T2D patients ≥18 years initiating empagliflozin or sitagliptin from 08/2014 through 09/2016. The HHF outcome was defined as a HF discharge diagnosis in the primary position (HHF-specific); a broader definition was based on a HF discharge diagnosis in any position (HHF-broad). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated controlling for over 140 baseline characteristics in each data source and pooled by fixed-effects meta-analysis. Results: After PS-matching, we identified 16,443 patient pairs who initiated empagliflozin or sitagliptin. Average age was approximately 59 years, almost 54% of the participants were males, and approximately 25% had records of existing cardiovascular disease. Compared to sitagliptin, the initiation of empagliflozin decreased the risk of HHF-specific by 50% (HR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.28-0.91), and the risk of HHF-broad by 49% (HR: 0.51;95% CI: 0.39-0.68), over a mean follow-up of 5.3 months. Results were consistent in patients with and without baseline cardiovascular disease, and for both empagliflozin 10 mg or 25mg daily dose; analyses comparing empagliflozin vs. the DPP-4i class, and comparing SGLT2i vs. DPP-4i classes also produced consistent findings.Conclusions: The first interim analysis from EMPRISE showed that compared with sitagliptin, the initiation of empagliflozin was associated with a decreased risk of HHF among patients with T2D as treated in routine care, with and without a history of cardiovascular disease.

Characterization of renal glucose reabsorption in response to dapagliflozin in healthy subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Care 36, 3169–3176 (2013).Treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin reduced both the maximum tubular reabsorptive capacity for glucose (TmG) and the renal threshold for glucosuria. From the clinical standpoint, the reduction in the renal threshold to &lt;2.2 mmol/l (&lt;40 mg/dl) is the primary mechanism responsible for the glucosuria and reduction in HbA1c with SGLT2 inhibition.27.Mogensen, C.

This difference is explained by the ability of SGLT1 to markedly increase its reabsorption of glucose following SGLT2 inhibition.30.Rahmoune, H. et al.

FDA warns about rare occurrences of a serious infection of the genital area with SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes,"[8-29-2018] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that cases of a rare but serious infection of the genitals and area around the genitals have been reported with the class of type 2 diabetes medicines called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This serious rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, is also referred to as Fournier's gangrene. We are requiring a new warning about this risk to be added to the prescribing information of all SGLT2 inhibitors and to the patient Medication Guide.SGLT2 inhibitors are FDA-approved for use with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood sugar by causing the kidneys to remove sugar from the body through the urine. First approved in 2013, medicines in the SGLT2 inhibitor class include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin (see FDA-Approved SGLT2 Inhibitors). In addition, empagliflozin is approved to lower the risk of death from heart attack and stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to serious problems, including blindness, nerve and kidney damage, and heart disease.Patients should seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms of tenderness, redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area from the genitals back to the rectum, and have a fever above 100.4 F or a general feeling of being unwell. These symptoms can worsen quickly, so it is important to seek treatment right away.Health care professionals should assess patients for Fournier's gangrene if they present with the symptoms described above. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary. Discontinue the SGLT2 inhibitor, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.Fournier's gangrene is an extremely rare but life-threatening bacterial infection of the tissue under the skin that surrounds muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels of the perineum. The bacteria usually get into the body through a cut or break in the skin, where they quickly spread and destroy the tissue they infect. Having diabetes is a risk factor for developing Fournier's gangrene; however, this condition is still rare among diabetic patients. Overall published literature about the occurrence of Fournier's gangrene for men and women is very limited. Publications report that Fournier's gangrene occurs in 1.6 out of 100,000 males annually in the U.S., and most frequently occurs in males 50-79 years (3.3 out of 100,000).1-3 In our case series, however, we observed events in both women and men.In the five years from March 2013 to May 2018, we identified 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene in patients taking an SGLT2 inhibitor. This number includes only reports submitted to FDA* and found in the medical literature,4-6 so there may be additional cases about which we are unaware. In 2017, an estimated 1.7 million patients received a dispensed prescription for an SGLT2 inhibitor from U.S. outpatient retail pharmacies.7 Although most cases of Fournier's gangrene have previously been reported in men, our 12 cases included 7 men and 5 women. Fournier's gangrene developed within several months of the patients starting an SGLT2 inhibitor and the drug was stopped in most cases. All 12 patients were hospitalized and required surgery. Some patients required multiple disfiguring surgeries, some developed complications, and one patient died. In comparison, only six cases of Fournier's gangrene (all in men) were identified in review of other antidiabetic drug classes over a period of more than 30 years.To help FDA track safety issues with medicines, we urge patients and health care professionals to report side effects involving SGLT2 inhibitors or other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the ""Contact FDA"" box at the bottom of the page.*The cases were reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).FDA-Approved SGLT2 InhibitorsBrand NameActive Ingredient(s)InvokanacanagliflozinInvokametcanagliflozin and metforminInvokamet XRcanagliflozin and metformin extended-releaseFarxigadapagliflozinXigduo XRdapagliflozin and metformin extended-releaseQterndapagliflozin and saxagliptinJardianceempagliflozinGlyxambiempagliflozin and linagliptinSynjardyempagliflozin and metforminSynjardy XRempagliflozin and metformin extended-releaseSteglatroertugliflozinSeglurometertugliflozin and metforminSteglujanertugliflozin and sitagliptin",https://t.co/6U4UbgvsmM,others
CREDENCE Takes SGLT2 Inhibitors 'to the Next Level',"The enormity of the need for better treatments for diabetic kidney disease is underscored by the fact that it has been almost 18 years since the last advancement in this area, with the advent of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers. It's not surprising, then, that considerable excitement had built up in anticipation of results from the CREDENCE trial, which were presented recently in Melbourne, Australia, at the International Society of Nephrology congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.[1] This trial shows an unequivocal benefit of canagliflozin in diabetic kidney disease, similar to the straightforward secondary prevention and cardiovascular risk reduction revealed for empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial more than 3 years ago.[2] Although the composite renal endpoint reduction (a post hoc analysis at that time) was a pleasant surprise in EMPA-REG, nephroprotection was subsequently corroborated in the CANVAS program[3] with canagliflozin, and more recently in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial[4] with dapagliflozin, albeit as a secondary outcome. Unequivocal Renal Benefits Notably, CREDENCE randomly assigned participants to receive canagliflozin or placebo on top of RAAS blocker therapy (as a mandatory study inclusion criterion), and still observed a staggering 30% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death. In addition to the statistically significant primary outcome benefit, several clinically important renal outcomes, as well as the composite major acute cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death), were reduced significantly. In a subgroup analysis, the primary composite endpoint reduction appears to be at least as robust, if not more, in the 60% of trial participants who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Nephroprotection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, especially at a low eGFR, is thought to be glucose independent. This is quite apparent in CREDENCE, where a minimal end-of-study A1c difference (0.1%) was observed between the trial arms in favor of canagliflozin. This concept of glucose-independent nephroprotection is further set to be tested in the ongoing Dapa-CKD trial and the upcoming EMPA-KIDNEY trial, both of which include a proportion of participants without diabetes. Broadly, CREDENCE is yet another positive outcome trial—with renal endpoints reported as the primary objective for the first time for an SGLT2 inhibitor—that adds weight to the ongoing paradigm shift of clinical practice guidelines toward emphasizing reduction of complications as the primary goal of diabetes management rather than focusing solely on a glucose target approach. Limitations to Consider Let me point out two limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results from CREDENCE: Further review and analyses may be necessary to provide clarity on the 27% of participants who discontinued the study drug within the median 2.6 years of follow-up. This percentage appears to be comparatively worse in CREDENCE than in most recently completed outcome trials in diabetes, which have an approximately 5% drug discontinuation rate per year. As acknowledged in the publication, one of the statistical limitations of CREDENCE is that the trial was stopped early at a planned interim analysis, which may increase the risk of overestimating effect sizes. Notwithstanding, the extremely tight (ie, small magnitude and spread) number needed to treat of 22 (95% confidence interval, 15-38) for the primary outcome over 2.5 years appears to be staggeringly clinically significant. What About the Amputation Risk? Anticipation (and anxieties) were even greater for this randomized trial to confirm (or not) the amputation and fracture signals observed in the CANVAS program. A collective sigh of relief was felt in the Melbourne presentation hall when no such increase in adverse outcomes was reported. The next pertinent question, then, is: How do we integrate the dissimilar amputation results in the cardiovascular versus kidney disease outcome trial programs of canagliflozin? Here are a few speculative guesses: Could differing populations have resulted in the observed amputation risk differential? Notably, unlike CANVAS, CREDENCE used only the lower dose of canagliflozin. Could this difference in study protocol, together with the less potent glucose lowering with canagliflozin at lower eGFR (and possibly less diuresis as a result), explain the discrepancy? Could practice and trial protocol adaptations after the CANVAS amputation revelations have influenced the subsequent amputation risk differential among the trial arms in CREDENCE? In addition to a more careful and comprehensive prospective assessment of foot complications (including full foot exams) mandated by a protocol amendment, investigators were recommended to interrupt study medication for any significant foot-related condition associated with amputations (including lower-extremity infection, skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, and critical limb ischemia) until the condition resolves. However, if indeed the above practice and protocol changes were effective, should we have expected a lower rate of amputations overall? Such a speculative explanation appears to fall flat if you consider the relatively high amputation rates observed in both trial arms (no statistical difference between an event rate of 12.3 in the canagliflozin group and 11.2 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group). Could the amputation signal in CANVAS be a statistical anomaly (ie, a type 1 error)? That interpretation, though possible, should only be entertained cautiously if none of the above or any other plausible explanations provide clues to the singular adverse findings in CANVAS. Speculations aside, we must remember that data are data, especially when the evidence is coming from a high-quality randomized trial such as CREDENCE. Hence, the correct interpretation of the nonobservance of an amputation signal in CREDENCE may be that in real-life clinical situations, when physicians choose patients similar to those enrolled in the trial and practice regular foot care and counseling, the risk (if any) for amputations may be mitigated. Overall, CREDENCE takes the positive outcome evidence accruing for SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes (since EMPA-REG OUTCOME in 2015) to the next level, and indeed may be considered a game-changing landmark trial for diabetic kidney disease, much like the pivotal EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial for secondary cardiovascular prevention.

Weekly Scope - Hustle and flow,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) plus chronic kidney disease (CKD) equals half your waiting room and too many of your after-work conversations. SGLT2 inhibitors are here to help. Residency seems to trickle by, but it's a blur compared to the 18 years that have passed since renin angiotensin blockade was shown to be effective in T2D patients with nephropathy. So while ACE inhibitors and ARBs remain a treatment mainstay, there's room for another bullet point in your assessment and plan. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors work directly in the kidney and have shown a trend towards renal benefit in prior studies. A mega-trial for renal outcomes was only a matter of time. CREDENCE compared SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozan to placebo in 4,400 patients with T2D and evidence of CKD. All patients were on ACE inihibitors or ARBs. After median follow-up of 2.6 years, the trial was stopped early when investigators found a 30% decrease in the primary composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, or death from renal or CV causes. Observed CV benefits were on par with prior SGLT2 inhibitor trials. And though canagliflozan was associated with fracture and amputation in 2017's CANVAS trial, no such trend was evident here.NEJM With an estimated number needed to treat of 22 for the primary outcome and 40 for CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, canagliflozan impressed. Make sure to consider an SGLT2 inhibitor for all of your eligible clinic patients. When your patient is crashing and your senior resident went home Most stressors are temporary, but some have staying power. A Swedish population based cohort study found that patients with stress related disorders – in this case PTSD, acute stress reaction, and adjustment disorder – were more likely to experience incident cardiovascular disease than unaffected siblings and matched controls. Effects were most pronounced in the first year after diagnosis, when patients were 65% more likely than siblings to develop CV disease. BMJ When the code pager goes off mid-nap Change of pace. Sedation with propofol is thought to decrease vascular tone, while α-2 agonists like dexmedetomidine (dex) may increase it. An open label, prospective study of 38 patients with septic shock switched patients from sedation with propofol to sedation with dex for 4 hours and then back to propofol. Pressor requirements dropped by more than half when patients were switched to dex. The findings will need to be confirmed in larger studies.Crit Care Med When your attending's looking right at your phone Observation changes behavior, and a study of adherence to hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in persons who inject drugs (PWID) found a benefit for directly observed therapy (DOT) in the Bronx. Of 150 patients with genotype 1 HCV infection in opioid agonist therapy programs, those assigned to DOT had higher adherence (86% vs. 75%) to therapy compared to self-administered individual treatment. HCV remains vastly undertreated, and PWID are often denied treatment due to concerns over adherence and drug resistance.Annals Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) primarily affects patients with underlying liver disease. So while hepatitis and alcohol abuse drive many of today's cases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is expected to be a big contributor in the future. Disease incidence is 2 - 4% yearly in patients with cirrhosis, and HCC currently ranks as the second most lethal malignancy (in terms of 5-year overall survival) behind pancreatic cancer. Surgical resection, liver transplant, and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are treatment options for early or intermediate stage disease, while sorafenib is frontline therapy for advanced disease. With surveillance of high-risk patients in HCC. A 2014 analysis of 15,000 patients with cirrhosis across 47 studies found that HCC surveillance was associated with higher rates of early detection, curative treatment, and overall survival. Abdominal ultrasound every 6 months with or without serum alpha-fetoprotein is recommended for patients with cirrhosis, regardless of cause. Patients with chronic HBV or HCV with advanced fibrosis can also be considered for screening.

Speculations aside, we must remember that data are data, especially when the evidence is coming from a high-quality randomized trial such as CREDENCE. Hence, the correct interpretation of the nonobservance of an amputation signal in CREDENCE may be that in real-life clinical situations, when physicians choose patients similar to those enrolled in the trial and practice regular foot care and counseling, the risk (if any) for amputations may be mitigated. Overall, CREDENCE takes the positive outcome evidence accruing for SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes (since EMPA-REG OUTCOME in 2015) to the next level, and indeed may be considered a game-changing landmark trial for diabetic kidney disease, much like the pivotal EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial for secondary cardiovascular prevention.

SGLT2 Inhibitors,"Doctors prescribe sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors to treat Type 2 diabetes.These drugs include Invokana and Farxiga.Unlike most other Type 2 diabetes drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors don't act on the hormone insulin or the pancreas.These drugs work by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose (sugar) and releasing it into the blood.Diagram of how a SGLT2 inhibitor blocks the reabsorption of glucoseThe kidneys are powerful glucose filters. SGLT2 is a glucose transporter found in the kidneys. It reabsorbs 90 percent of glucose and returns it to the blood.SGLT2 inhibitors block SGLT2 and stop the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys. Instead, the kidneys get rid of glucose through urine.Studies show SGLT2 inhibitors are effective in controlling excess blood sugar in people with Type 2 diabetes. But potent blood sugar control also comes with side effects.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration released warnings about side effects that can be fatal.As of April 2018, more than 1,000 people had sued makers of SGLT2 inhibitors over failure to warn of the drugs' risks.SGLT2 Inhibitor Side Effects and FDA WarningsSGLT2 inhibitors can cause serious side effects. The FDA has issued several warnings since the agency approved the first SGLT2 inhibitor in 2013.The FDA required label changes to add new warnings and strengthen existing warnings. For the most serious injuries, the agency requires a black box warning.Serious Side EffectDateFDA ActionAmputation riskMay 2017Black box warning Acute kidney injuryJune 2016Stronger warningsUrinary tract infections causing serious kidney and blood infections December 2015New warningsBone fractures September 2015Stronger warningsDiabetic KetoacidosisMay 2015New warningsSGLT2 inhibitors may pose a risk to fetuses. The drug should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies or outweighs this risk.These drugs are not for use in people with Type 1 diabetes or people with diabetic ketoacidosis.Types of SGLT2 InhibitorsSeveral brands of SGLT2 inhibitors are available in the U.S. Each drug comes in an oral tablet. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are active ingredients in SGLT2 inhibitors. Some also contain metformin.All SGLT2 inhibitors work in relatively the same way. Some are also available in extended release formulas.Invokana, Invokamet and Invokamet XRInvokana 300mg pillInvokana (canagliflozin) became the first FDA-approved SGLT2 inhibitor.Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a Johnson &amp; Johnson company manufacturers the drug.J&amp;J spent $19.8 million marketing the drug to doctors in 2014, according to Bloomberg.The FDA approved Invokomet and Invokamet XR soon after. Invokamet and its extended release version Invokamet XR combine canagliflozin with metformin.In 2017, the FDA confirmed canagliflozin causes an increased risk of amputations. The agency required Johnson &amp; Johnson to add a black box warning to the drugs' labels.The label change affects Invokana, Invokamet and Invokamet XR.People who took Invokana and suffered amputation and other side effects are suing Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Farxiga has the typical side effects of other SGLT2s. Clinical trials revealed people who take it may be more likely to develop bladder cancer.A federal judicial panel consolidated 60 Farxiga lawsuits in federal court.The lawsuits blame manufacturers Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and AstraZeneca for making a defective drug.About 50 lawsuits remained pending as of April 2018.DosagesFarxiga - 5 mg and 10 mg tabletsXigduo XR - 5 mg dapagliflozin/500 mg metformin; 5 mg/1000 mg; 10 mg/500 mg; 10 mg/1000 mg tabletsDrug InteractionsDapagliflozin - Insulin, insulin secretagoguesMetformin - Alcohol, cimetidine, topiramate, zonisamide, acetazolamideCostFarxiga – about $334 for 30 tabletsXigduo XR – about $457 for 30 tabletsSide effectsBladder cancerDiabetic ketoacidosisKidney injuryUrinary tract infections leading to blood infectionsLactic acidosis (Xigduo XR)FDA approvalFarxiga – January 2014Xigduo XR – October 2014Jardiance, Glyxambi and SynjardyThe FDA approved Jardiance (empagliflozin) in 2014.

The metabolic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors - Does the increase in ketone bodies protect the heart?,"Type 2 diabetes causes excess cardiovascular mortality and microvascular disease. Therefore, the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial were received with great excitement, since this was the first trial with cardiovascular end points to show a benefit for persons suffering from type 2 diabetes. The striking benefit of a 38% reduction in cardiovascular mortality during SGLT2 inhibitor treatment was surprising and exceeded what was expected based on the relatively modest reductions in glycemic levels, blood pressure and body weight observed in the trial. Therefore, alternative explanations for the cardioprotective effects are sought. It has been suggested that the increase in circulating ketone bodies, observed during SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, could mediate these effects by acting as a superfuel for the heart. This remains controversial since experimental evidence regarding the metabolic effects of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is limited, however, we have recently demonstrated a striking effect with a 50% reduction in glucose uptake during ketone infusion. In our ongoing study, we continue to investigate the hypothesis, that the increase in circulating ketone bodies will reduce oxygen consumption and improve the efficiency of the heart by increasing ketone body oxidation at the expense of FFA and glucose oxidation. We are doing this in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study in persons with type 2 diabetes. Using a novel combination of PET tracer techniques, we measure oxygen consumption, energy efficiency, and FFA and glucose oxidation in the heart. Uniquely, this allows previously inaccessible in-vivo measurement of cardiac substrate metabolism. The results of the study will provide new important mechanistic insight into the role of ketone bodies in the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. A beneficial effect of an increase in ketone bodies could lead to development of targeted treatment to promote ketogenesis in people suffering from type 2 diabetes or ischemic heart disease.",https://t.co/JcpwxgKbJt,others
SGLT2 inhibitors in Type 1 Diabetes: What Are the Risks?,"My name is Simon Heller. I'm professor of clinical diabetes at the University of Sheffield in the north of England and I'm going to discuss the recent approval [EU positive opinion for type 1 diabetes] of one of the newer agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the SGLT2 inhibitors.* A number of these drugs, for example dapagliflozin (Forxiga/Farxiga/Edistride, AstraZeneca), will soon be approved for use in certain people with type 1 diabetes. These drugs are already approved for the treatment of type 2 and they've been really quite useful. They help to lower blood glucose and improve HbA1c levels. They can also reduce weight, and perhaps most interesting of all, there's some evidence that they may reduce cardiac mortality. Perhaps, and this is speculation, but there is evidence that it might be because they have effects on reducing heart failure which is an issue in type 2 diabetes. I think perhaps most interesting of all there's a suggestion that they may have benefits on the kidney, they may be what we call renoprotective, and we need to know more about that. But clearly if there were medications which prevented the complication of diabetic kidney disease, that would be fantastic. So why not use them in type 1 diabetes? The reason that there has been caution and a bit of concern is that they do, in some cases even in type 2 diabetes, cause diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a potentially lethal complication. And therefore, we need to be absolutely sure that they can be used safely. So one of the issues is that they lower glucose levels by increasing secretion of glucose in the kidney, and therefore they may require insulin levels themselves to be reduced in people who are receiving insulin treatment. And could it be that that reduction in insulin is contributing [to ketoacidosis]? I think it probably is. So is it a wise decision to allow these drugs to be used in type 1 diabetes? They clearly have potential benefits, and some patients think they're really great when they go on them. So in terms of quality of life … that's an issue. But of course, if they do increase the risk of ketoacidosis, which is potentially fatal, I think we have to be very cautious. So, I think the approval has suggested that patients should be well aware of what needs to be done. And actually we've been involved in some of the clinical trials. And we have given patients very careful instruction about checking for their ketone levels, particularly if they're not feeling well, or that glucose has crept up. But interestingly, even with all that advice, we have had a few patients who still got into mild ketoacidosis. So I think we should regard this [upcoming] approval with a bit of concern. I think if you have people with [type 1] diabetes, who are very well educated, know exactly what to do, and do everything that their doctor and nurse tells them, probably that's fine. But of course, many individuals …find that challenging to do. There are people who don't take their insulin regularly who are at risk of ketoacidosis, whose HbA1c levels are often high. And if you're going to choose those people it could increase the risk that people might get very ill, or even might die, and that is my concern. The other issue is that [SGLT2 inhibitors] are used widely by primary care physicians and in type 2 diabetes, that's generally very safe. But of course, there are people with type 1 diabetes who attend primary care clinics because they don't find it easy or rewarding to go to secondary care units where most type 1 diabetes is treated, at least in the UK. I think giving these medications to people with type 1 diabetes without careful surveillance and expert supervision does increase the risk. So I think it's likely …the use of these medications in type 1 will increase. But I think we should have some concerns and scrutinise the results, particularly those who have side effects, very carefully as we move into a new era. * A second medication, the oral SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin (Sanofi) has also recently been given an EU positive opinion , also for use in certain patients with type 1 diabetes, under strict criteria. Sotagliflozin is not approved for type 2 diabetes, however.",https://t.co/5q2HT0fpkH,others
FDA warns about rare occurrences of a serious infection of the genital area with SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes,"[8-29-2018] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that cases of a rare but serious infection of the genitals and area around the genitals have been reported with the class of type 2 diabetes medicines called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This serious rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, is also referred to as Fournier's gangrene. We are requiring a new warning about this risk to be added to the prescribing information of all SGLT2 inhibitors and to the patient Medication Guide.SGLT2 inhibitors are FDA-approved for use with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood sugar by causing the kidneys to remove sugar from the body through the urine. First approved in 2013, medicines in the SGLT2 inhibitor class include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin (see FDA-Approved SGLT2 Inhibitors). In addition, empagliflozin is approved to lower the risk of death from heart attack and stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to serious problems, including blindness, nerve and kidney damage, and heart disease.Patients should seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms of tenderness, redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area from the genitals back to the rectum, and have a fever above 100.4 F or a general feeling of being unwell. These symptoms can worsen quickly, so it is important to seek treatment right away.Health care professionals should assess patients for Fournier's gangrene if they present with the symptoms described above. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary. Discontinue the SGLT2 inhibitor, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.Fournier's gangrene is an extremely rare but life-threatening bacterial infection of the tissue under the skin that surrounds muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels of the perineum. The bacteria usually get into the body through a cut or break in the skin, where they quickly spread and destroy the tissue they infect. Having diabetes is a risk factor for developing Fournier's gangrene; however, this condition is still rare among diabetic patients. Overall published literature about the occurrence of Fournier's gangrene for men and women is very limited. Publications report that Fournier's gangrene occurs in 1.6 out of 100,000 males annually in the U.S., and most frequently occurs in males 50-79 years (3.3 out of 100,000).1-3 In our case series, however, we observed events in both women and men.In the five years from March 2013 to May 2018, we identified 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene in patients taking an SGLT2 inhibitor. This number includes only reports submitted to FDA* and found in the medical literature,4-6 so there may be additional cases about which we are unaware. In 2017, an estimated 1.7 million patients received a dispensed prescription for an SGLT2 inhibitor from U.S. outpatient retail pharmacies.7 Although most cases of Fournier's gangrene have previously been reported in men, our 12 cases included 7 men and 5 women. Fournier's gangrene developed within several months of the patients starting an SGLT2 inhibitor and the drug was stopped in most cases. All 12 patients were hospitalized and required surgery. Some patients required multiple disfiguring surgeries, some developed complications, and one patient died. In comparison, only six cases of Fournier's gangrene (all in men) were identified in review of other antidiabetic drug classes over a period of more than 30 years.To help FDA track safety issues with medicines, we urge patients and health care professionals to report side effects involving SGLT2 inhibitors or other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the ""Contact FDA"" box at the bottom of the page.*The cases were reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).FDA-Approved SGLT2 InhibitorsBrand NameActive Ingredient(s)InvokanacanagliflozinInvokametcanagliflozin and metforminInvokamet XRcanagliflozin and metformin extended-releaseFarxigadapagliflozinXigduo XRdapagliflozin and metformin extended-releaseQterndapagliflozin and saxagliptinJardianceempagliflozinGlyxambiempagliflozin and linagliptinSynjardyempagliflozin and metforminSynjardy XRempagliflozin and metformin extended-releaseSteglatroertugliflozinSeglurometertugliflozin and metforminSteglujanertugliflozin and sitagliptin",https://t.co/8d90qSVUQ2,others
"Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on body composition, fluid status and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in type 2 diabetes: a prospective study using bioimpedance spectroscopy | Cardiovascular Diabetology | Full Text","We found that the reduction of body weight during treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin and dapagliflozin is caused by changes in volume status with decrease of extracellular water during the first days of intake, and by decrease of adipose tissue mass during the following weeks and months. The body weight reduction in our study was − 2.6 kg after 6 months and in the same range as reported previously with a body weight reduction of − 1.9 to − 2.3 after 14 to 24 weeks after initiation of a SGLT2 inhibitor [3, 5, 6, 28].In our study, the reduction of body weight after 6 months was due to a loss of adipose tissue mass, while lean tissue mass did not change significantly. This is consistent with results from similar studies that used x-ray absorptiometry or calculated indices of adipose tissue mass [5–7]. Other studies involving bioimpedance spectroscopy also found that weight loss under SGLT2 inhibition after 12–104 weeks was mainly via reduction of adipose mass [8–10]. It has been discussed that the loss of adipose mass under SLGT2 inhibition can be attributed to an energy loss due to increased glycosuria [28–30] and increased lipid utilization [31]. Interestingly, besides body fat, epicardial fat was reduced under medication with SGLT2 inhibitors, providing another possible mechanism of reduction of cardiovascular mortality by SGLT2 inhibitors [32, 33].As the probably most obvious mechanism of cardiovascular risk reduction under SGLT2 inhibition, a diuretic effect as a consequence of increased glucosuria and natriuresis, can be expected [20]. A novel and important finding of the present study is that changes in body fluid status are transient after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment with empagliflozin or dapagliflozin. Extracellular water was reduced rapidly and significantly after 3 days, but had returned to baseline value when measured after three and 6 months. In a cohort of post-transplant diabetes mellitus, Schwaiger et al. [11] also found a decrease of extracellular fluid after 4 weeks and extracellular water returned to baseline value in the further course. In Japanese patients treated with ipragliflozin, Iizuka et al. [8] found a reduction of total body water by − 0.43 kg at 4 weeks, and a rising tendency at 12 weeks (− 0.37 kg), compared to baseline, respectively, with changes of body fluid mainly caused by extracellular water and no significant changes of intracellular water; however, changes of volume status during the first days of SGLT2 inhibition were not measured and follow up period was shorter, thus missing data on initial as well as long term changes in body fluid status. In our cohort, extracellular water was consistently decreased after 1 and 3 months (− 0.4 L/1.73 m2 at day 30 and − 0.2 L/1.73 m2 at day 90, compared to baseline, respectively), and showed a return to initial value in the long term follow up (− 0.01 L/1.73 m2 at day 180 compared to baseline).As one consequence of the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, a reduction of arterial blood pressure can be expected. In our cohort, along with the course of OH and ECW, systolic and diastolic office blood pressure tended to decrease after 3 days, but there were no significant differences after 3 and 6 months, compared to baseline, respectively. However, in our study, blood pressure was measured only as a single office blood pressure. In studies that considered ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce blood pressure measured after 3 and 6 months of intake [34–37].In accordance to our finding of transient decreased OH and ECW, increase of urine volume after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors has also been found to be transient and was caused rather by natriuresis than by osmotic diuresis due to glycosuria [29, 38]. After initiation of SGLT2 inhibition, an initial, but no long-term elevated natriuresis has been shown, and compensatory mechanisms such as increased sodium reuptake through following tubular transporters and activation of RAAS, have been investigated [38, 39]. Systemic RAAS has been shown to be activated transiently in patients with type 2 diabetes after beginning of SGLT2 inhibitors [39], whereas intrarenal RAAS is not activated after SGLT2 inhibition [40]. SGLT2 inhibitors have been recommended as combination therapy to RAAS inhibitors, especially in diabetic kidney disease [41]. In our study, despite preexisting medication with RAAS inhibitors in nearly all patients, changes of fluid status were accompanied by a trend towards elevated plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone concentration after 30 days, suggesting an increased activity of RAAS, with normalization after 6 months. Our results therefore confirm active counteracting mechanisms of fluid regulation after inhibition of SGLT2 as discussed previously [39].SGLT2 inhibitors have been suspected to promote the occurrence of stroke due to volume depletion [42, 43], with the Kaplan–Meier curves suggesting elevated risk of stroke during the first time after initiation of SGLT2 inhibition [44]. In the long term, however, stroke incidence is not elevated paralleling the normalization of volume depletion [45]. Another concern about the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is that they could promote renal failure. Indeed, parallel to the reduction of ECW after 3 days and 1 month in our cohort, a decline of GFR was observed after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors [46]. However, in the long term course, SGLT2 inhibitors have even been associated with a slower progression of chronic kidney disease [30, 46]. In our cohort, ongoing fluid loss or reduction of extracellular water as a risk of stroke or prerenal kidney injury was not observed with SGLT2 inhibition, supporting the safety of prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors, as long as counter-regulating mechanisms of fluid status are operative.At baseline, participants of our study were normally hydrated as both, OH and ECW were in reference ranges. Comparison to a group of hypertensive patients with medication with hydrochlorothiazide as a diuretic agent showed no differences in fluid status of patients with chronic intake of SGLT2 inhibitors, hydrochlorothiazide, or no diuretic medication. This suggests that there is also no ongoing loss of extracellular water under treatment with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide similar to SGLT2 inhibitors due to counter-regulation. In contrast to our study cohort, patients with heart failure are at risk for fluid overload and extracellular water accumulation, leading to hydropic decompensation and hospitalization [47]. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors has been shown to reduce this risk [12] and was found to be safe and efficient in patients with type 2 diabetes and different stages of cardiovascular disease [48]. SGLT2 inhibition could lead to a sustained correction of fluid accumulation in patients starting with an elevated level of overhydration and extracellular water. This is supported by the finding that patients at risk for heart failure, who were treated with empagliflozin, had a reduced need for loop diuretics [14]. In a cohort of chronic kidney disease patients with fluid retention, decrease of extracellular fluid under medication with dapagliflozin was smaller than under medication with furosemide, but larger than under medication with tolvaptan [49]. Our data therefore are compatible with the notion that the protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors from heart failure is related to their effect on extracellular volume and overhydration. This effect could even be enhanced in patients with overhydration at baseline.Overall, the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors seems to be most effective during the initial period of SGLT2 inhibition [38], and we showed that it causes changes in fluid status and could therefore be responsible for fast acting beneficial effects on heart failure; reduction of adipose tissue that we confirmed in the follow up period of SGLT2 inhibition indicates that additional mechanisms for risk reduction in heart failure could gain importance in the long term course, such as lipid utilization [31], reduction of epicardial fat [32, 33], and effects on vascular endothelial function [50].The limitations of this study are the small number of patients and healthy participants without heart failure or proteinuria, conditions known to be associated with overhydration and edema. The strengths of the study are the direct measurements with the output of quantitative data of volume status and body composition by using bioimpedance spectroscopy. To our knowledge, it is the first study concentrating on the changes of fluid status and body composition during the first days after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment and during a follow up period of 6 months. Even in our small cohort, significant changes in the intraindividual course of the parameters of interest could be detected, indicating robustness of the observed changes.",https://t.co/RxpzXZHYTt,others
Cardiovascular Benefits of SGLT2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Type 2 Diabetes,"EMAIL THIS ARTICLECardiovascular Benefits of SGLT2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Type 2 DiabetesPublished: February 25, 2019Since 2008, because of safety concerns, the FDA has mandated that long-term cardiovascular outcomes trials be conducted for all new drugs for type 2...Since 2008, because of safety concerns, the FDA has mandated that long-term cardiovascular outcomes trials be conducted for all new drugs for type 2 diabetes.1 Reductions in the incidence of macrovascular complications in these trials with some sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease (see Table 1) have led to new recommendations.2-4STANDARD TREATMENT — Metformin (Glucophage, and others) is the drug of choice for initial treatment of type 2 diabetes.5 For patients who do not achieve their A1C goal with metformin, the choice of an additional drug varies with the comorbidities of the patient. For those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefits is now preferred.3 The SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin (Jardiance) and canagliflozin (Invokana) and the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (Victoza) are the only drugs to date with an FDA-approved indication for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.6ADVERSE EFFECTS — SGLT2 inhibitors can cause genital mycotic and urinary tract infections, acute kidney injury, volume depletion, hypotension, and ketoacidosis. An increased risk of fractures and of lower limb amputation, primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal, have been reported with canagliflozin.7GLP-1 receptor agonists can cause injection-site reactions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, renal impairment, and acute renal failure, and they might increase the risk of pancreatitis and cholangiocarcinoma.8 Thyroid C-cell carcinoma has been reported in animals and thyroid C-cell hyperplasia in humans; these drugs are contraindicated for use in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma and in those with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.9 Semaglutide (Ozempic) has been associated with a significant increase in diabetic retinopathy complications.10,11RECOMMENDATIONS — The American College of Cardiology preferentially recommends use of liraglutide, particularly for patients with osteoporosis, prior amputations, severe peripheral artery disease, peripheral neuropathy, or active lower extremity soft tissue ulcers or infections, or empagliflozin, especially for those at high risk for heart failure.2RECENT DATA — Recent retrospective analyses have suggested that use of any SGLT2 inhibitor may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events12 and hospitalization for heart failure.13 In one meta-analysis that included 236 trials, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists were both associated with lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.14CONCLUSION — In patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who have not achieved their A1C goal with metformin, addition of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin (Jardiance) or the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (Victoza) is recommended to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Results to date suggest that all SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.© The Medical Letter, Inc. All Rights Reserved.",https://t.co/WdBA3lfoPy,others
CREDENCE Takes SGLT2 Inhibitors 'to the Next Level',"The enormity of the need for better treatments for diabetic kidney disease is underscored by the fact that it has been almost 18 years since the last advancement in this area, with the advent of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers. It's not surprising, then, that considerable excitement had built up in anticipation of results from the CREDENCE trial, which were presented recently in Melbourne, Australia, at the International Society of Nephrology congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.[1] This trial shows an unequivocal benefit of canagliflozin in diabetic kidney disease, similar to the straightforward secondary prevention and cardiovascular risk reduction revealed for empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial more than 3 years ago.[2] Although the composite renal endpoint reduction (a post hoc analysis at that time) was a pleasant surprise in EMPA-REG, nephroprotection was subsequently corroborated in the CANVAS program[3] with canagliflozin, and more recently in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial[4] with dapagliflozin, albeit as a secondary outcome. Unequivocal Renal Benefits Notably, CREDENCE randomly assigned participants to receive canagliflozin or placebo on top of RAAS blocker therapy (as a mandatory study inclusion criterion), and still observed a staggering 30% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death. In addition to the statistically significant primary outcome benefit, several clinically important renal outcomes, as well as the composite major acute cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death), were reduced significantly. In a subgroup analysis, the primary composite endpoint reduction appears to be at least as robust, if not more, in the 60% of trial participants who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Nephroprotection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, especially at a low eGFR, is thought to be glucose independent. This is quite apparent in CREDENCE, where a minimal end-of-study A1c difference (0.1%) was observed between the trial arms in favor of canagliflozin. This concept of glucose-independent nephroprotection is further set to be tested in the ongoing Dapa-CKD trial and the upcoming EMPA-KIDNEY trial, both of which include a proportion of participants without diabetes. Broadly, CREDENCE is yet another positive outcome trial—with renal endpoints reported as the primary objective for the first time for an SGLT2 inhibitor—that adds weight to the ongoing paradigm shift of clinical practice guidelines toward emphasizing reduction of complications as the primary goal of diabetes management rather than focusing solely on a glucose target approach. Limitations to Consider Let me point out two limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results from CREDENCE: Further review and analyses may be necessary to provide clarity on the 27% of participants who discontinued the study drug within the median 2.6 years of follow-up. This percentage appears to be comparatively worse in CREDENCE than in most recently completed outcome trials in diabetes, which have an approximately 5% drug discontinuation rate per year. As acknowledged in the publication, one of the statistical limitations of CREDENCE is that the trial was stopped early at a planned interim analysis, which may increase the risk of overestimating effect sizes. Notwithstanding, the extremely tight (ie, small magnitude and spread) number needed to treat of 22 (95% confidence interval, 15-38) for the primary outcome over 2.5 years appears to be staggeringly clinically significant. What About the Amputation Risk? Anticipation (and anxieties) were even greater for this randomized trial to confirm (or not) the amputation and fracture signals observed in the CANVAS program. A collective sigh of relief was felt in the Melbourne presentation hall when no such increase in adverse outcomes was reported. The next pertinent question, then, is: How do we integrate the dissimilar amputation results in the cardiovascular versus kidney disease outcome trial programs of canagliflozin? Here are a few speculative guesses: Could differing populations have resulted in the observed amputation risk differential? Notably, unlike CANVAS, CREDENCE used only the lower dose of canagliflozin. Could this difference in study protocol, together with the less potent glucose lowering with canagliflozin at lower eGFR (and possibly less diuresis as a result), explain the discrepancy? Could practice and trial protocol adaptations after the CANVAS amputation revelations have influenced the subsequent amputation risk differential among the trial arms in CREDENCE? In addition to a more careful and comprehensive prospective assessment of foot complications (including full foot exams) mandated by a protocol amendment, investigators were recommended to interrupt study medication for any significant foot-related condition associated with amputations (including lower-extremity infection, skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, and critical limb ischemia) until the condition resolves. However, if indeed the above practice and protocol changes were effective, should we have expected a lower rate of amputations overall? Such a speculative explanation appears to fall flat if you consider the relatively high amputation rates observed in both trial arms (no statistical difference between an event rate of 12.3 in the canagliflozin group and 11.2 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group). Could the amputation signal in CANVAS be a statistical anomaly (ie, a type 1 error)? That interpretation, though possible, should only be entertained cautiously if none of the above or any other plausible explanations provide clues to the singular adverse findings in CANVAS. Speculations aside, we must remember that data are data, especially when the evidence is coming from a high-quality randomized trial such as CREDENCE. Hence, the correct interpretation of the nonobservance of an amputation signal in CREDENCE may be that in real-life clinical situations, when physicians choose patients similar to those enrolled in the trial and practice regular foot care and counseling, the risk (if any) for amputations may be mitigated. Overall, CREDENCE takes the positive outcome evidence accruing for SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes (since EMPA-REG OUTCOME in 2015) to the next level, and indeed may be considered a game-changing landmark trial for diabetic kidney disease, much like the pivotal EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial for secondary cardiovascular prevention.

CREDENCE Takes SGLT2 Inhibitors 'to the Next Level',"The enormity of the need for better treatments for diabetic kidney disease is underscored by the fact that it has been almost 18 years since the last advancement in this area, with the advent of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers. It's not surprising, then, that considerable excitement had built up in anticipation of results from the CREDENCE trial, which were presented recently in Melbourne, Australia, at the International Society of Nephrology congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.[1] This trial shows an unequivocal benefit of canagliflozin in diabetic kidney disease, similar to the straightforward secondary prevention and cardiovascular risk reduction revealed for empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial more than 3 years ago.[2] Although the composite renal endpoint reduction (a post hoc analysis at that time) was a pleasant surprise in EMPA-REG, nephroprotection was subsequently corroborated in the CANVAS program[3] with canagliflozin, and more recently in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial[4] with dapagliflozin, albeit as a secondary outcome. Unequivocal Renal Benefits Notably, CREDENCE randomly assigned participants to receive canagliflozin or placebo on top of RAAS blocker therapy (as a mandatory study inclusion criterion), and still observed a staggering 30% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death. In addition to the statistically significant primary outcome benefit, several clinically important renal outcomes, as well as the composite major acute cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death), were reduced significantly. In a subgroup analysis, the primary composite endpoint reduction appears to be at least as robust, if not more, in the 60% of trial participants who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Nephroprotection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, especially at a low eGFR, is thought to be glucose independent. This is quite apparent in CREDENCE, where a minimal end-of-study A1c difference (0.1%) was observed between the trial arms in favor of canagliflozin. This concept of glucose-independent nephroprotection is further set to be tested in the ongoing Dapa-CKD trial and the upcoming EMPA-KIDNEY trial, both of which include a proportion of participants without diabetes. Broadly, CREDENCE is yet another positive outcome trial—with renal endpoints reported as the primary objective for the first time for an SGLT2 inhibitor—that adds weight to the ongoing paradigm shift of clinical practice guidelines toward emphasizing reduction of complications as the primary goal of diabetes management rather than focusing solely on a glucose target approach.

Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors: A Case Study in Translational Research,"Natriuresis and Decreased Blood PressureWhen canagliflozin (300 mg) was administered to healthy volunteers, 24-h urinary Na+ excretion increased by 1.25 g, a mean increase of 32% (18). As discussed above, natriuresis was transient, with a return to baseline within 5 days. As shown in a study in subjects with type 2 diabetes, levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide decreased, and plasma renin activity increased (20). Drug-induced natriuresis likely contributes to a long-term reduction in blood pressure (3–5 mmHg systolic blood pressure) (Table 2). Other mechanisms have also been suggested. Despite a drug-induced decrease in blood pressure, it has been reported that SGLT2 inhibitors do not increase heart rate. For example, among patients with baseline heart rates &gt;80 beats/min (bpm), luseogliflozin was associated with a 7.5-bpm decrease in heart rate compared with a 3.9-bpm decrease in placebo-treated patients (48). Similarly, dapagliflozin did not increase heart rates compared with placebo (49). Cherney et al. (50) reported that empagliflozin did not change circulating catecholamine levels in patients with type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, they observed that empagliflozin decreased arterial stiffness (50). In any case, Kubota et al. (51) published a description of the rationale and study design for a clinical trial to study the effect of empagliflozin on cardiac sympathetic activity in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and Tanaka et al. (52) published the rationale and study design for a clinical trial to study the effect of empagliflozin on endothelial function.CardioprotectionAs required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cardiovascular outcome trials have been initiated for all SGLT2 inhibitors approved in the U.S. The primary outcomes were related to cardiovascular safety, but prespecified hierarchical statistical analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that there might be cardiovascular benefit. Tests for superiority were conducted only if the noninferiority analysis confirmed cardiovascular safety. Both the BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) and the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) demonstrated reductions of the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with hazard ratios of 0.86 for both empagliflozin (1) and canagliflozin (3). Data on secondary outcomes differed in some respects (e.g., differences in the risks of individual components of the primary composite MACE outcome cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke). These differences in secondary outcomes may reflect statistical variation rather than true differences. The Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events trial (DECLARE-TIMI 58) demonstrated that dapagliflozin achieved a statistically significant decrease in a composite end point of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure but a statistically insignificant trend toward fewer MACE (53). In the cardiovascular outcome trials for empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin, SGLT2 inhibitor–treated patients experienced decreased risks of hospitalization for heart failure (Table 2). It is likely that the natriuretic action of these drugs contributes importantly to the heart failure benefit. All three studies exhibited a trend toward a 10–15% decrease in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction but did not achieve statistical significance in any of the individual studies. None of the studies demonstrated benefit with respect to the risk of nonfatal stroke (Table 2), with point estimates of hazard ratios ranging from 1.24 (empagliflozin) to 0.90 (canagliflozin). Whereas empagliflozin demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 0.62), neither canagliflozin nor dapagliflozin was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk of cardiovascular death (Table 2). It is unknown whether the three drugs are truly differentiated with respect to cardiovascular benefit. It remains possible that random variation or differences in study design or patient population may contribute to the observed differences. For example, whereas &gt;99% of patients in EMPA-REG OUTCOME had established cardiovascular disease, this was true for only 65.6% in CANVAS and only 40.6% of patients in DECLARE-TIMI 58.EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 were all designed as randomized placebo-controlled trials. Compared with placebo-treated patients, drug-treated patients had lower HbA1c and lower blood pressure. HbA1c was ∼0.6% lower at 3–6 months, but the difference decreased to ∼0.2% by the end of the trials. Mean systolic blood pressure was ∼4 mmHg lower, which may have contributed to the decrease in cardiovascular risk. It would be of interest to conduct a treat-to-target study design in which patients were randomized to an SGLT2 inhibitor–based regimen or a non-SGLT2 inhibitor–based regimen (e.g., a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP-4] inhibitor) plus a generic antihypertensive and treated to equivalent blood pressure and glycemic control to evaluate differences in cardiovascular risk. When DPP-4 inhibitors become generic, a combination of a generic DPP-4 inhibitor plus a generic antihypertensive would likely be substantially less expensive than a proprietary SGLT2 inhibitor. Accordingly, this type of head-to-head comparison has the potential to provide great value by decreasing the cost of pharmacotherapy. The long-term randomized clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors have been sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and have been designed as placebo-controlled trials (1,3). There would be great value in conducting randomized controlled comparative effectiveness studies. Unfortunately, the National Institutes of Health–sponsored Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE) (54) does not include an SGLT2 inhibitor among the four drugs being evaluated as second-line therapy for combination with metformin.It is instructive to compare these data with the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure (ACCORD-BP) clinical trial and Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) (55). In the SPRINT study of patients without diabetes, intensive blood pressure control was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.64–0.89) for MACE. This represents a greater risk reduction than the hazard ratio of 0.86 observed in EMPA-REG OUTCOME (1) and CANVAS (3), but the magnitude of blood pressure reduction was also greater in SPRINT. Similarly, intensive blood pressure control was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% CI 0.63–0.95) for MACE in the standard glycemia arm of the ACCORD-BP study. The standard glycemia arm of ACCORD-BP had a similar mean HbA1c (∼7.5% [58 mmol/mL]) as the SGLT2 inhibitor arms of EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS. In contrast, the placebo-treated arm of EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS had substantially higher mean levels of HbA1c (8.0–8.2% [64–66 mmol/mol]).Exploratory analyses have evaluated correlations of various parameters with the observed decrease in the risk of cardiovascular death in empagliflozin-treated patients (56). Although the authors acknowledged that EMPA-REG OUTCOME was not designed to determine mechanisms, they applied statistical mediation analysis to generate hypotheses about possible causality. This approach identified several possible mediators (with percent mediation in parentheses): hematocrit (51.8%), albumin (25.5%), uric acid (24.6%), and fasting plasma glucose (16.1%). Although these hypotheses are thought provoking, a number of questions arise. For example, it is not clear whether exploratory statistical analysis can dissect the relative contributions of closely related physiological mechanisms, such as decreased blood pressure and increased hematocrit and albumin (all of which are triggered at least in part by drug-induced natriuresis). Furthermore, their mediation analysis placed great weight on how each parameter evolved over time. In the case of HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose, different conclusions were reached depending on how data were analyzed. Glycemic parameters seemed more important in an analysis that assessed chronic effects, whereas glycemia seemed less important in an analysis that focused on levels of HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose closer to the time of death. In the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, patients from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) were followed up 11 years after the end of DCCT. While mean HbA1c levels were essentially identical in both arms (intensive vs. conventional treatment) at the time of the analysis, patients receiving intensive treatment a decade earlier experienced a 57% decrease in the risk of MACE (57). A subsequent analysis published on the 30th anniversary of the DCCT confirmed the cardiovascular benefit with longer follow-up (58). These data strongly suggest that prior glycemic control may be more important than the level of glycemic control at the time an adverse cardiovascular event actually occurs. Whether the metabolic memory effect is mediated directly by glycemic control or indirectly (e.g., by postponement of renal disease), these observations suggest that chronic glycemic control (rather than glycemic control at the time of the adverse event) may have been an important predictor of cardiovascular death in EMPA-REG OUTCOME (56).SGLT2 inhibitor–induced natriuresis with plasma volume contraction could contribute to an acute increase in hematocrit as a result of hemoconcentration. In response to an SGLT2 inhibitor, however, hematocrit continues to increase gradually and attains maximum values only after 16 weeks of treatment (22). This gradual increase in hematocrit is unlikely due to plasma volume contraction because SGLT2 inhibitor–induced natriuresis is transient, with a new steady state being established within a few days. Rather, the increased hematocrit may be attributed to stimulation of renal erythropoietin secretion by SGLT2 inhibitors, leading to new red blood cell formation. Dapagliflozin has induced an early rise in serum erythropoietin accompanied by reticulocytosis and an increase in measured red cell mass (22,59). Empagliflozin has triggered a similar increase in serum erythropoietin (59).RenoprotectionEmpagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have been reported to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease (hazard ratio ∼0.70) (2,3,53). As discussed above for cardiovascular outcome trials, renal outcome data were obtained from placebo-controlled trials in which SGLT2 inhibitor–treated patients had a significantly lower mean HbA1c and blood pressure. While these two risk factors probably contributed to the observed renoprotection, it is not clear that the magnitude of decreases in HbA1c and blood pressure were sufficient to account for the magnitude of renoprotection. Other SGLT2 inhibitor–specific mechanisms have also been proposed to contribute to renal benefit. For example, hyperglycemia increases the quantity of glucose filtered at the glomerulus, which in turn drives upregulation of proximal tubular SGLTs, increasing renal proximal tubular reabsorption of both Na+ and glucose. This would decrease delivery of Na+ to the macula densa, thereby promoting hyperfiltration through the mechanism of tubuloglomerular feedback (19,60). Hyperfiltration is believed to be an important causal element in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. When empagliflozin was administered to patients with type 1 diabetes, the drug restored normal glomerular filtration rates in patients with hyperfiltration (19). Several other mechanisms have also been proposed to contribute to renoprotection, including decreased levels of serum uric acid, increased hematocrit, and elevated ketone body levels (2,3,61,62).",https://t.co/zsbojpYGej,others
Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy,"AbstractBackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide, but few effective long-term treatments are available. In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.MethodsIn this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to &lt;90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], &gt;300 to 5000) and were treated with renin–angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of &lt;15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.ResultsThe trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. At that time, 4401 patients had undergone randomization, with a median follow-up of 2.62 years. The relative risk of the primary outcome was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.82; P=0.00001). The relative risk of the renal-specific composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the creatinine level, or death from renal causes was lower by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P&lt;0.001), and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was lower by 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.86; P=0.002).

Postmarketing data support Fournier gangrene link with SGLT2 inhibitors,"medwireNews: Fournier gangrene remains very rare, but is more common in people using sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors compared with other diabetes medications and has severe consequences, shows research.The analysis of postmarketing data, reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine, reveals 55 cases in patients using SGLT2 inhibitors over a nearly 6-year period between March 2013 and January 2019. By contrast, there were only 19 cases in patients using other diabetes medications over a much longer 35-year period. Susan Bersoff-Matcha and FDA colleagues from Silver Spring, Maryland, USA, note that SGLT2 inhibitor treatment results in glycosuria, which raises the risk for urinary tract and urogenital infections, which in turn are thought to increase risk for Fournier gangrene.""In addition, because the perineum already is colonized with organisms from the gastrointestinal tract, the enriched environment provided by glycosuria-enhanced growth of urogenital flora may provide the ideal milieu for [Fournier gangrene],"" they say.However, urinary tract infection was reported in just two of the 55 patients in this study, and whether it ""was an important inciting event in the remaining cases is unclear,"" the team adds.Cases of Fournier gangrene occurred in patients using all SGLT2 inhibitors apart from ertugliflozin, which the researchers attribute to the latter's relatively short length of time on the market – just over a year at the time of the analysis. They stress that Fournier gangrene remains overall rare, ""accounting for less than 0.02% of annual hospitalizations in the United States.""The 39 men and 16 women who developed Fournier gangrene were aged between 33 and 87 years and they developed the condition between 5 days and 49 months after starting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.Three patients died, and all surviving patients required hospitalization, for between 5 and 51 days. Although the number of operations was not always stated, at least 25 patients underwent more than one surgical procedure, with one needing 17 operations. Other severe complications were common, with eight cases of diabetic ketoacidosis, nine of sepsis or septic shock, and four of acute kidney injury.Discharge destination was recorded for only six of the surviving patients, all of whom were transferred to a rehabilitation facility. But the researchers ""suspect that almost no patient could return home immediately and that total inpatient time was much longer.""Bersoff-Matcha and team stress that ""[t]he single most important factor in preventing death in patients with diabetes is early recognition and surgical intervention, with tissue sampling for culture,"" and highlight the need for education of healthcare providers who prescribe SGLT2 inhibitors.They note that six patients in their study had more than one healthcare provider contact before they received a Fournier gangrene diagnosis, suggesting that the provider had initially failed to recognize the true problem.""Systemic symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, and malaise, may be variable and nonspecific,"" the researchers observe.They say: ""Pain that seems out of proportion to findings on physical examination is a strong clinical indicator of necrotizing fasciitis and may be the most important diagnostic clue"", and urge a ""high index of suspicion"" for the condition in patients using SGLT2 inhibitors.

FDA Tallies Cases of Fournier Gangrene in Patients Taking SGLT2 Inhibitors,"The US Food and Drug Administration has identified 55 new cases of Fournier gangrene in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and recommend physicians prescribing the drugs ""have a high index of suspicion"" to identify the condition in its earliest stages. Time from onset after starting the SGLT2 inhibitor ranged from 5 days to 49 months and all patients required ""surgical debridement and were severely ill,"" according to the new analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database published May 6, 2017, in the Annals of Internal Medicine.Susan Bersoff-Matcha, MD (Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD), who led the analysis, stressed that Fournier gangrene is a rare event. ""While our study shows an association between treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and Fournier gangrene, we don't know exactly what the risk is, or if Fournier gangrene can be predicted,"" she told TCTMD via email. ""Doctors should be aware of the association between Fournier gangrene and SGLT2 inhibitor use and discuss this potential complication as part of an informed prescriber-patient discussion regarding appropriate diabetes therapy. Although the risk for Fournier gangrene is low, serious infection should be considered and weighed against the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.""Also known as necrotizing fasciitis of perineum, the condition is a rapid and progressive infection of the external genitalia, perineum, and perianal region that is treated with antibiotics and immediate surgery. The overall incidence of Fournier gangrene in the general population is 1.6 per 100,000 men, with a peak incidence of 3.3 per 100,000 men aged 50 to 79 years. Recent studies have shown that Fournier gangrene can occur in both men and women, with cutaneous, anorectal, and urogenital infections attributed as the cause in the majority of these cases. Bersoff-Matcha noted that diabetes is a known risk factor for Fournier gangrene, as is alcoholism, HIV infection, and use of cytotoxic drugs. The reason Fournier gangrene develops in a small minority of patients with diabetes is not well understood, she said.Dear Doctor Letters IssuedThe 55 cases of Fournier gangrene among patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors were reported to the FDA between March 2013 and January 2019. In total, 39 men and 16 women developed the necrotizing fasciitis. The average time from starting the SGLT2 inhibitor to the development of the condition was 9 months and cases included use of every SGLT2 inhibitor commercially available in the US except ertugliflozin (Steglatro; Merck). Complications of the gangrene included diabetic ketoacidosis, sepsis/septic shock, and acute kidney injury. Eight patients required fecal diversion surgery and two needed amputations of a lower extremity. Three patients died. In September 2018, the FDA warned physicians about the possible risk of Fournier gangrene in diabetic patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Health authorities in the United Kingdom also alerted physicians to reports of Fournier gangrene with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. To TCTMD, Darren McGuire, MD (UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), noted that physicians have received ""Dear Doctor"" letters regarding the potential risk of this rare event, but said he is uncertain what to make of the association given that the number of cases is small and abstracted from the voluntarily-reported FDA adverse event registry. Additionally, it is impossible at present to make direct comparisons across treatments or to map observed-versus-expected events based on epidemiologic/natural history estimates of risk or incidence. Nonetheless, even without definitive conclusions, ""this does rise to the level of 'risk signal' that we are paying attention to moving forward in the randomized trials,"" he told TCTMD in email.McGuire, one of the investigators of the DECLARE TIMI-58 trial testing dapagliflozin (Farxiga; AstraZeneca), noted their group presented adverse event data at the American Heart Association 2018 Scientific Sessions showing eight total cases of Fournier gangrene, with only one case in the dapagliflozin-treated group and seven in the placebo arm. While these numbers are ""way too small to draw any meaningful conclusions,"" he says, they do suggest there was no safety signal in the randomized controlled trial.For physicians, McGuire said, these new data should not be ""prohibitive or adversely affect prescription"" in patients eligible for SGLT2 inhibitors based on the randomized trial data and in accordance with the FDA label. The appropriate response is continued patient and provider education with a heightened awareness of signs and symptoms of Fournier gangrene, continued counseling on urinary hygiene when prescribing, and ongoing surveillance in the SGLT2 inhibitor trials, he said.",https://t.co/Pw4eCfPf9o,news

CREDENCE Takes SGLT2 Inhibitors 'to the Next Level',"The enormity of the need for better treatments for diabetic kidney disease is underscored by the fact that it has been almost 18 years since the last advancement in this area, with the advent of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers. It's not surprising, then, that considerable excitement had built up in anticipation of results from the CREDENCE trial, which were presented recently in Melbourne, Australia, at the International Society of Nephrology congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.[1] This trial shows an unequivocal benefit of canagliflozin in diabetic kidney disease, similar to the straightforward secondary prevention and cardiovascular risk reduction revealed for empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial more than 3 years ago.[2] Although the composite renal endpoint reduction (a post hoc analysis at that time) was a pleasant surprise in EMPA-REG, nephroprotection was subsequently corroborated in the CANVAS program[3] with canagliflozin, and more recently in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial[4] with dapagliflozin, albeit as a secondary outcome. Unequivocal Renal Benefits Notably, CREDENCE randomly assigned participants to receive canagliflozin or placebo on top of RAAS blocker therapy (as a mandatory study inclusion criterion), and still observed a staggering 30% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death. In addition to the statistically significant primary outcome benefit, several clinically important renal outcomes, as well as the composite major acute cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death), were reduced significantly. In a subgroup analysis, the primary composite endpoint reduction appears to be at least as robust, if not more, in the 60% of trial participants who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Nephroprotection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, especially at a low eGFR, is thought to be glucose independent. This is quite apparent in CREDENCE, where a minimal end-of-study A1c difference (0.1%) was observed between the trial arms in favor of canagliflozin. This concept of glucose-independent nephroprotection is further set to be tested in the ongoing Dapa-CKD trial and the upcoming EMPA-KIDNEY trial, both of which include a proportion of participants without diabetes. Broadly, CREDENCE is yet another positive outcome trial—with renal endpoints reported as the primary objective for the first time for an SGLT2 inhibitor—that adds weight to the ongoing paradigm shift of clinical practice guidelines toward emphasizing reduction of complications as the primary goal of diabetes management rather than focusing solely on a glucose target approach. Limitations to Consider Let me point out two limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results from CREDENCE: Further review and analyses may be necessary to provide clarity on the 27% of participants who discontinued the study drug within the median 2.6 years of follow-up. This percentage appears to be comparatively worse in CREDENCE than in most recently completed outcome trials in diabetes, which have an approximately 5% drug discontinuation rate per year. As acknowledged in the publication, one of the statistical limitations of CREDENCE is that the trial was stopped early at a planned interim analysis, which may increase the risk of overestimating effect sizes. Notwithstanding, the extremely tight (ie, small magnitude and spread) number needed to treat of 22 (95% confidence interval, 15-38) for the primary outcome over 2.5 years appears to be staggeringly clinically significant. What About the Amputation Risk? Anticipation (and anxieties) were even greater for this randomized trial to confirm (or not) the amputation and fracture signals observed in the CANVAS program. A collective sigh of relief was felt in the Melbourne presentation hall when no such increase in adverse outcomes was reported. The next pertinent question, then, is: How do we integrate the dissimilar amputation results in the cardiovascular versus kidney disease outcome trial programs of canagliflozin? Here are a few speculative guesses: Could differing populations have resulted in the observed amputation risk differential? Notably, unlike CANVAS, CREDENCE used only the lower dose of canagliflozin. Could this difference in study protocol, together with the less potent glucose lowering with canagliflozin at lower eGFR (and possibly less diuresis as a result), explain the discrepancy? Could practice and trial protocol adaptations after the CANVAS amputation revelations have influenced the subsequent amputation risk differential among the trial arms in CREDENCE? In addition to a more careful and comprehensive prospective assessment of foot complications (including full foot exams) mandated by a protocol amendment, investigators were recommended to interrupt study medication for any significant foot-related condition associated with amputations (including lower-extremity infection, skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, and critical limb ischemia) until the condition resolves. However, if indeed the above practice and protocol changes were effective, should we have expected a lower rate of amputations overall? Such a speculative explanation appears to fall flat if you consider the relatively high amputation rates observed in both trial arms (no statistical difference between an event rate of 12.3 in the canagliflozin group and 11.2 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group). Could the amputation signal in CANVAS be a statistical anomaly (ie, a type 1 error)? That interpretation, though possible, should only be entertained cautiously if none of the above or any other plausible explanations provide clues to the singular adverse findings in CANVAS. Speculations aside, we must remember that data are data, especially when the evidence is coming from a high-quality randomized trial such as CREDENCE. Hence, the correct interpretation of the nonobservance of an amputation signal in CREDENCE may be that in real-life clinical situations, when physicians choose patients similar to those enrolled in the trial and practice regular foot care and counseling, the risk (if any) for amputations may be mitigated. Overall, CREDENCE takes the positive outcome evidence accruing for SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes (since EMPA-REG OUTCOME in 2015) to the next level, and indeed may be considered a game-changing landmark trial for diabetic kidney disease, much like the pivotal EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial for secondary cardiovascular prevention.

Researchers warn about gangrene cases in patients on SGLT2 diabetes drugs,"After the FDA last year slapped a warning label on SGLT2 diabetes drugs, detailing risks of an infection with a rare flesh-eating bacteria, a team of researchers has come out with a new set of numbers—and a warning for doctors prescribing the drugs.In a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers found patients taking SGLT2 drugs—a class that includes Johnson &amp; Johnson's Invokana, AstraZeneca's Farxiga, and Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance —suffered from 55 unique cases of Fournier's gangrene, a rare flesh-eating bacterial infection of the genitals. The cases were recorded between March 1, 2013, and January 31, 2019.The researchers collected those numbers from the FDA's adverse event reporting database. Thirty-nine patients were men and 16 were women. The rare condition was associated with severe consequences. All patients had surgery to remove unhealthy tissue and were ""severely ill.""

Glenmark launches cheaper SGLT2 inhibitor class of anti-diabetes drug in India,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals on April 30 launched a novel and patented anti-diabetes drug belonging to the class of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which is said to be 50-60 percent cheaper than the existing medications of same class in the market.The drug, generically called as Remogliflozin etabonate, is used in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus in adults and was approved by Indian drug regulator CDSCO in March this year. India is the first country where the drug will be sold.According to data from IQVIA, India's diabetes market is estimated at Rs 11,413 crore for the year ended March 2019. The market size of SGLT2 inhibitors is estimated at Rs. 574 crore in the same period.The exact price of Remogliflozin isn't yet known.At present three versions of SGLT2 inhibitors are sold in India belonging to British drug maker Astrazeneca's dapagliflozin (Farxiga), US-based Janssen Pharmaceuticals canagliflozin (Invokana) and Germany-based Boehringer Ingelheim's empagliflozin (Jardiance). Their cost range anywhere between Rs 450 to Rs 550 per 10 tablets.Glenmark said it will commercialise Remogliflozin in India under brand names Remo and Remozen.SGLT2 inhibitors are third generation anti-diabetic drugs that help achieve glycemic control by acting on the SGLT2 receptors in the proximal tubule of the kidney, thereby preventing renal reabsorption of glucose and promoting excretion of glucose in the urine.SGLT2 drugs provide glycemic control, induce weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risks.Glenmark received regulatory approval for Remogliflozin 100 mg tablets, twice daily, after successfully completing Phase-3 clinical trials in which Remogliflozin demonstrated good efficacy and safety profile in a head-to-head comparison against Dapagliflozin.Remogliflozin, the latest drug in SGLT2 inhibitors' class to get regulatory approval in the world, has been studied in 26 clinical trials globally, covering around 2,500 people from various ethnicities.Remogliflozin was discovered and developed by Japanese firm Kissei Pharmaceutical and later developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Glenmark collaborator BHV Pharma, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avolynt.Glenmark secured certain rights to Remogliflozin through a licensing collaboration agreement with BHV Pharma, and conducted the Phase-3 clinical trial.""Globally, SGLT2 inhibitors are emerging as a preferred treatment for management of type-2 diabetes and Glenmark is proud to introduce a novel molecule in this class, which is cutting-edge and researched extensively. Diabetes is a key area of focus for Glenmark and with the launch of Remogliflozin, the company aims to improve access to SGLT2 inhibitors by providing an effective, high quality and world-class treatment option to patients in India,"" said Sujesh Vasudevan, President, India Formulations, Middle East and Africa at Glenmark Pharmaceuticals.The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes have recommended use of SGLT2 inhibitors as an alternative first line treatment to Metformin or as an adjunctive treatment in the management of type-2 diabetes mellitus.SGLT2 inhibitors are particularly recommended for use in patients that have certain established cardiovascular diseases.India is estimated to have around 72 million adults living with diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation's Diabetes Atlas 2017.Get Lok Sabha 2019 Live Election Results, constituency-wise tally, news, views and analysisFollow our Lok Sabha Election Result Live Blog here.",https://t.co/AkFcfbekpk,news
"In good news for diabetics, new drug to be 60% cheaper","Mumbai: Diabetics in the country have something to cheer about. A completely new drug in the SGLT2 Inhibitor (sodium glucose co-transporter-2) family is being introduced here for the first time globally, which promises to disrupt the anti-diabetes market by lowering cost of therapy by nearly 60%. The drug offers an affordable treatment for millions of type 2 diabetese patients to tackle the debilitating disease which gradually attacks and weakens all body organs. Remogliflozin, developed by Mumbai-based Glenmark, will be priced around Rs 25 for daily therapy, as against other drugs in the same class available between Rs 55-60 per day. This marks the first global approval to a new drug application by the regulator for an SGLT2 Inhibitor in India. SGLT2 Inhibitors are one of the fastest-selling diabetes drugs globally, totalling $9 billion, while in India they grew by 10 times over three years to nearly Rs 600 crore. At present, the same class of drugs available here are all patented. Diabetes is fast gaining the status of a potential epidemic in India with 74 million individuals currently diagnosed with the disease, along with a huge undiagnosed diabetes population. The economic burden of diabetes is high in India as most patients pay out of their pocket for treatment due to the lack of medical reimbursement. The cost of treatment includes consultation, investigations, drugs and monitoring, and, due to the nature of the disease, the complications related to the disease may increase it substantially.The SGLT2 category is known to provide glycemic control, induce weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risks, doctors say. Anoop Misra, an endocrinologist, says this is an excellent class (of drugs). For Remogliflozin, the pricing advantage will be attractive for patients who cannot afford the expensive alternatives, but more robust trials are needed to prove the efficacy and safety. Remogliflozin was discovered and developed by Japanese firm Kissei Pharmaceutical and later developed by GlaxoSmithKline and BHV Pharma, a subsidiary of US company, Avolynt. Glenmark secured certain rights to Remogliflozin through a collaboration with BHV Pharma, and developed the drug and conducted Phase-3 clinical trials on over 600 patients. Metformin continues to be the first line treatment for patients with type-2 diabetes but as the disease progresses, other diabetes medicines are added, which include Sulfonylureas class (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors class (teneligliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin) and SGLT2 Inhibitors class (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin).According to data from market research firm, IQVIA, the diabetes market in India is estimated at Rs 11,500 crore (MAT March 2019), with that of SGLT2 Inhibitors at nearly Rs 600 crore.",https://t.co/XvQI5qOnJz,news

SGLT2 inhibitors to prevent heart and kidney disease in type 2 diabetes,"SGLT2 inhibitors to prevent heart and kidney disease in type 2 diabetes Posted by Medivizor on Apr 27, 2019 in Diabetes mellitus | In a nutshell The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the prevention of heart and kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The main outcome was that SGLT2-inhibitors reduced hospitalization for heart failure and prevented the worsening of kidney disease in T2D.Some background There are many complications of T2D. These include heart and kidney disease. In particular, patients with T2D have an increased rate of atherosclerosis (ATS). This is a build-up of plaque in the blood vessels in the body. These plaques result in high blood pressure and increased risk of major cardiac events (heart attack, stroke, death). SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are drugs used in the treatment of T2D. They work by blocking the uptake of sugar in the kidney back into the blood. Instead, the sugar gets removed from the body in the urine. Some SGLT2i include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance). The effect of SGLT2i on preventing heart and kidney disease in patients with T2D is still under investigation.Methods &amp; findings This study included data from 3 trials with 34,322 patients. 60.2% of these patients already had established ATS before treatment with SGLT2i.SGLT2i reduced major cardiac events by 11%. However, this benefit was only seen in patients who already had ATS. SGLT2i also decreased the rate of hospitalization due to heart failure by 23%. This was seen in both patients with and without ATS. SGLT2i also prevented the worsening of kidney disease by 45% in patients with and without ATS.The bottom line The authors concluded that SGLT2i decreased the rate of major cardiac events only in patients with ATS. However, SGLT2i decreased the hospitalization for heart failure and prevented kidney disease worsening in both patients with and without ATS.Published By :Lancet (London, England)Original Title :SGLT2 inhibitors for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials.

SGLT2 inhibitors in Type 1 Diabetes: What Are the Risks?,"My name is Simon Heller. I'm professor of clinical diabetes at the University of Sheffield in the north of England and I'm going to discuss the recent approval [EU positive opinion for type 1 diabetes] of one of the newer agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the SGLT2 inhibitors.* A number of these drugs, for example dapagliflozin (Forxiga/Farxiga/Edistride, AstraZeneca), will soon be approved for use in certain people with type 1 diabetes. These drugs are already approved for the treatment of type 2 and they've been really quite useful. They help to lower blood glucose and improve HbA1c levels. They can also reduce weight, and perhaps most interesting of all, there's some evidence that they may reduce cardiac mortality. Perhaps, and this is speculation, but there is evidence that it might be because they have effects on reducing heart failure which is an issue in type 2 diabetes. I think perhaps most interesting of all there's a suggestion that they may have benefits on the kidney, they may be what we call renoprotective, and we need to know more about that. But clearly if there were medications which prevented the complication of diabetic kidney disease, that would be fantastic. So why not use them in type 1 diabetes? The reason that there has been caution and a bit of concern is that they do, in some cases even in type 2 diabetes, cause diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a potentially lethal complication. And therefore, we need to be absolutely sure that they can be used safely. So one of the issues is that they lower glucose levels by increasing secretion of glucose in the kidney, and therefore they may require insulin levels themselves to be reduced in people who are receiving insulin treatment. And could it be that that reduction in insulin is contributing [to ketoacidosis]? I think it probably is. So is it a wise decision to allow these drugs to be used in type 1 diabetes? They clearly have potential benefits, and some patients think they're really great when they go on them. So in terms of quality of life … that's an issue. But of course, if they do increase the risk of ketoacidosis, which is potentially fatal, I think we have to be very cautious. So, I think the approval has suggested that patients should be well aware of what needs to be done. And actually we've been involved in some of the clinical trials. And we have given patients very careful instruction about checking for their ketone levels, particularly if they're not feeling well, or that glucose has crept up. But interestingly, even with all that advice, we have had a few patients who still got into mild ketoacidosis. So I think we should regard this [upcoming] approval with a bit of concern. I think if you have people with [type 1] diabetes, who are very well educated, know exactly what to do, and do everything that their doctor and nurse tells them, probably that's fine. But of course, many individuals …find that challenging to do. There are people who don't take their insulin regularly who are at risk of ketoacidosis, whose HbA1c levels are often high. And if you're going to choose those people it could increase the risk that people might get very ill, or even might die, and that is my concern. The other issue is that [SGLT2 inhibitors] are used widely by primary care physicians and in type 2 diabetes, that's generally very safe. But of course, there are people with type 1 diabetes who attend primary care clinics because they don't find it easy or rewarding to go to secondary care units where most type 1 diabetes is treated, at least in the UK. I think giving these medications to people with type 1 diabetes without careful surveillance and expert supervision does increase the risk. So I think it's likely …the use of these medications in type 1 will increase. But I think we should have some concerns and scrutinise the results, particularly those who have side effects, very carefully as we move into a new era. * A second medication, the oral SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin (Sanofi) has also recently been given an EU positive opinion , also for use in certain patients with type 1 diabetes, under strict criteria. Sotagliflozin is not approved for type 2 diabetes, however.",https://t.co/MKkvtbTfYo,news
SGLT2 Inhibitors for Diabetes Linked to Rare 'Flesh-Eating' Genital Infection,"SGLT2 Inhibitors for Diabetes Linked to Rare 'Flesh-Eating' Genital InfectionMONDAY, May 6, 2019 -- Say you have type 2 diabetes and you are taking a newer class of medications to treat your disease -- but one day you notice pain, redness and a foul odor in your genital area.If this happens, new research suggests you need to see your doctor immediately, because you may be suffering from Fournier gangrene. Also known as a ""flesh-eating"" disease, this infection attacks your genital or anal region and can quickly kill tissue as it spreads rapidly.Unfortunately, it has become a rare but still possible safety concern for people taking diabetes medications known as SGLT2 inhibitors, according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists.SGLT2 inhibitors are a newer class of diabetes medications, introduced in 2013. Drugs in this class include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance) and ertugliflozin (Steglatro).Fournier gangrene occurred in 55 people taking these drugs between March 2013 and January 2019. For comparison, the researchers looked for cases of Fournier gangrene in people taking other diabetes medications from 1984 to 2019. They found only 19 such cases.Still, the risk for Fournier gangrene remains very low, the researchers stressed.""In 2017, an estimated 1.7 million patients received a dispensed prescription for an SGLT2 inhibitor,"" said study author Dr. Susan Bersoff-Matcha, a medical officer in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. So, ""Fournier gangrene is a rare event,"" she said. ""While our study shows an association between treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and Fournier gangrene, we don't know exactly what the risk is, or if Fournier gangrene can be predicted.""Broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgery to remove the dead tissue are treatment options, the researchers said.SGLT2 inhibitors work in the kidneys, allowing excess blood sugar to be removed in the urine, they said.In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, the drugs may also reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in some people with type 2 diabetes.But possible side effects include urinary tract infections and genital infections, such as yeast infections. Kidney problems can also be a concern with this class of medications.All of the patients with Fournier gangrene identified in this study needed to be hospitalized. Some had several surgeries. Three of the 55 people died from Fournier gangrene.The average age of the people with Fournier gangrene was 56. Thirty-nine were men. Forty-one cases occurred in the United States. Thirty-one of the 55 cases identified were also taking an additional diabetes medication.Of those with Fournier gangrene, 21 were using canagliflozin, 16 were using dapagliflozin and 18 were taking empagliflozin, the study said.Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, said that while the study was well-done, it cannot prove a cause-and-effect link between the drugs and the disease.""Infections of the pubic and rectal area are quite common in people with diabetes, they don't have Fournier's. Fournier's is a very aggressive, but extremely rare, disease,"" said Zonszein, who wasn't involved with the study.When Fournier gangrene does occur, it's hard to know if it is caused by a medication. He pointed out that a number of clinical trials have been done on SGLT2 inhibitors that have included tens of thousands of people, and there haven't been any reports of Fournier gangrene.""I counsel my patients about infections in the genitalia. The main concern is to be aware that they can occur. And, providers need to be more aware of Fournier's. They have to immediately try to establish the cause of infection and aggressively treat it if they suspect Fournier gangrene,"" Zonszein said.He said a far bigger concern is uncontrolled diabetes and the risk of complications when blood sugar levels aren't controlled. ""The benefits of these medications outweigh the risks,"" he said.In a statement, Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes Jardiance (empagliflozin), said the company actively monitors for side effects related to their medications.""We remain confident in the positive benefit-risk profile of empagliflozin, and empagliflozin-containing products, as outlined in the prescribing information,"" the statement from Boehringer Ingelheim said.The prescribing information of all SGLT2's was recently changed to reflect the possible risk of Fournier gangrene, as directed by the FDA.Janssen Pharmaceuticals, maker of Invokana (canagliflozin), and AstraZeneca, maker of Farxiga (dapagliflozin), did not respond to requests for comment.The findings were published May 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.More informationThe U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more about SGLT2 inhibitor medications. © 2019 HealthDay.

EMA confirms recommendations to minimise ketoacidosis risk with SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes,"Healthcare professionals should be aware of possible atypical casesThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has confirmed recommendations1 to minimise the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors (a class of type 2 diabetes medicines).Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes caused by low insulin levels. Rare cases of this condition, including life-threatening ones, have occurred in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes and a number of these cases have been atypical, with patients not having blood sugar levels as high as expected.An atypical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis can delay diagnosis and treatment. Healthcare professionals should therefore consider the possibility of ketoacidosis in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors who have symptoms consistent with the condition even if blood sugar levels are not high.Following a review of the cases, EMA has recommended updating the product information of SGLT2 inhibitors to list diabetic ketoacidosis as a rare adverse reaction (affecting up to 1 in 1,000 patients).Patients taking these medicines should be aware of the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, including rapid weight loss, nausea or vomiting, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to the breath, a sweet or metallic taste in the mouth, or a different odour to urine or sweat. Patients should contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straightaway if they have any of these symptoms.If diabetic ketoacidosis is suspected or confirmed, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors should be stopped immediately and should not be re-started unless another cause for the ketoacidosis is identified and resolved.Healthcare professionals should exercise caution with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with risk factors for ketoacidosis and inform patients of these factors. These include low insulin-producing capacity in the pancreas, a sudden drop in a patient's insulin dose, increased insulin requirement (due to illness, surgery or alcohol abuse) or conditions that can restrict food intake or lead to severe dehydration.In addition, EMA recommends temporarily stopping SGLT2 inhibitors in patients who are undergoing major surgery or are in hospital due to serious illness.Finally, EMA reminds healthcare professionals that SGLT2 inhibitors are not authorised for type 1 diabetes, noting that cases of ketoacidosis have also occurred during off-label use and clinical trials in type 1 diabetes.The benefits of these medicines continue to outweigh the risks in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.EMA's recommendations are based on an initial review by its Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC). The recommendations were then sent to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), which has now confirmed them and issued the Agency's final opinion.The CHMP's opinion will now be sent to the European Commission for a legally-binding decision valid throughout the EU.Information for patientsRare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis have occurred in people with type 2 diabetes taking diabetes medicines known as SGLT2 inhibitors.Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes. Symptoms include rapid weight loss, nausea or vomiting, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to the breath, a sweet or metallic taste in the mouth, or a different odour to urine or sweat.Some of the cases of diabetic ketoacidosis in people taking SGLT2 inhibitors did not show the very high sugar levels normally associated with this condition.If you have any of the symptoms above while taking an SGLT2 inhibitor, contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straightaway even if your sugar level is not particularly high. You may need emergency treatment and your diabetes medicine may need to be changed.SGLT2 inhibitors in the EU are available under the following trade names: Ebymect, Edistride, Forxiga, Invokana, Jardiance, Synjardy, Vokanamet and Xigduo.Information for healthcare professionalsRare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis, including life-threatening ones, have occurred in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, used to treat type 2 diabetes. A number of these cases were atypical with patients having only moderately raised blood sugar levels and some of them occurred during off-label use and clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes.Always consider the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors who have non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepiness.Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis and advise them to seek medical advice immediately if they develop such signs and symptoms.Stop treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors immediately if diabetic ketoacidosis is suspected or confirmed, and do not re-start treatment unless another clear precipitating factor for the condition is identified and resolved.Stop treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors temporarily in patients undergoing major surgical procedures or hospitalised due to acute serious medical illnesses. Treatment may be restarted once the patient's condition has stabilised.Exercise caution in patients with risk factors for ketoacidosis and inform patients of these factors. These include low reserve of insulin-secreting cells, a sudden reduction in insulin dose, an increased requirement for insulin (due to illness, surgery or alcohol abuse) and conditions that restrict food intake or can lead to severe dehydration.Healthcare professionals are reminded that SGLT2 inhibitors are only authorised for treating type 2 diabetes.More about the medicineSodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes. They block a protein in the kidneys called SGLT2, which absorbs glucose back from the urine into the bloodstream as the blood is filtered in the kidneys. By blocking the action of SGLT2, these medicines cause more glucose to be removed through the urine, thereby reducing the levels of glucose in the blood.The following SGLT2 inhibitors are authorised in the EU: Ebymect (dapagliflozin/metformin), Edistride (dapagliflozin), Forxiga (dapagliflozin), Invokana (canagliflozin), Jardiance (empagliflozin), Synjardy (empagliflozin / metformin), Vokanamet (canagliflozin / metformin) and Xigduo (dapagliflozin / metformin).More about the procedureThe review of SGLT2 inhibitors was initiated at the request of European Commission in June 2015, under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.The review was first carried out by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), the Committee responsible for the evaluation of safety issues for human medicines, which made a set of recommendations. The PRAC recommendations were sent to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), responsible for questions concerning medicines for human use, which has adopted the Agency's final opinion.The CHMP opinion will now be forwarded to the European Commission, which will issue a final legally binding decision applicable in all EU Member States in due course.1PRAC recommendations issued on 11 February 2016",https://t.co/xegMWnEdL4,news

CREDENCE Takes SGLT2 Inhibitors 'to the Next Level',"The enormity of the need for better treatments for diabetic kidney disease is underscored by the fact that it has been almost 18 years since the last advancement in this area, with the advent of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers. It's not surprising, then, that considerable excitement had built up in anticipation of results from the CREDENCE trial, which were presented recently in Melbourne, Australia, at the International Society of Nephrology congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.[1] This trial shows an unequivocal benefit of canagliflozin in diabetic kidney disease, similar to the straightforward secondary prevention and cardiovascular risk reduction revealed for empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial more than 3 years ago.[2] Although the composite renal endpoint reduction (a post hoc analysis at that time) was a pleasant surprise in EMPA-REG, nephroprotection was subsequently corroborated in the CANVAS program[3] with canagliflozin, and more recently in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial[4] with dapagliflozin, albeit as a secondary outcome. Unequivocal Renal Benefits Notably, CREDENCE randomly assigned participants to receive canagliflozin or placebo on top of RAAS blocker therapy (as a mandatory study inclusion criterion), and still observed a staggering 30% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death. In addition to the statistically significant primary outcome benefit, several clinically important renal outcomes, as well as the composite major acute cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death), were reduced significantly. In a subgroup analysis, the primary composite endpoint reduction appears to be at least as robust, if not more, in the 60% of trial participants who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Nephroprotection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, especially at a low eGFR, is thought to be glucose independent. This is quite apparent in CREDENCE, where a minimal end-of-study A1c difference (0.1%) was observed between the trial arms in favor of canagliflozin. This concept of glucose-independent nephroprotection is further set to be tested in the ongoing Dapa-CKD trial and the upcoming EMPA-KIDNEY trial, both of which include a proportion of participants without diabetes. Broadly, CREDENCE is yet another positive outcome trial—with renal endpoints reported as the primary objective for the first time for an SGLT2 inhibitor—that adds weight to the ongoing paradigm shift of clinical practice guidelines toward emphasizing reduction of complications as the primary goal of diabetes management rather than focusing solely on a glucose target approach. Limitations to Consider Let me point out two limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results from CREDENCE: Further review and analyses may be necessary to provide clarity on the 27% of participants who discontinued the study drug within the median 2.6 years of follow-up. This percentage appears to be comparatively worse in CREDENCE than in most recently completed outcome trials in diabetes, which have an approximately 5% drug discontinuation rate per year. As acknowledged in the publication, one of the statistical limitations of CREDENCE is that the trial was stopped early at a planned interim analysis, which may increase the risk of overestimating effect sizes. Notwithstanding, the extremely tight (ie, small magnitude and spread) number needed to treat of 22 (95% confidence interval, 15-38) for the primary outcome over 2.5 years appears to be staggeringly clinically significant. What About the Amputation Risk? Anticipation (and anxieties) were even greater for this randomized trial to confirm (or not) the amputation and fracture signals observed in the CANVAS program. A collective sigh of relief was felt in the Melbourne presentation hall when no such increase in adverse outcomes was reported. The next pertinent question, then, is: How do we integrate the dissimilar amputation results in the cardiovascular versus kidney disease outcome trial programs of canagliflozin? Here are a few speculative guesses: Could differing populations have resulted in the observed amputation risk differential? Notably, unlike CANVAS, CREDENCE used only the lower dose of canagliflozin. Could this difference in study protocol, together with the less potent glucose lowering with canagliflozin at lower eGFR (and possibly less diuresis as a result), explain the discrepancy? Could practice and trial protocol adaptations after the CANVAS amputation revelations have influenced the subsequent amputation risk differential among the trial arms in CREDENCE? In addition to a more careful and comprehensive prospective assessment of foot complications (including full foot exams) mandated by a protocol amendment, investigators were recommended to interrupt study medication for any significant foot-related condition associated with amputations (including lower-extremity infection, skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, and critical limb ischemia) until the condition resolves. However, if indeed the above practice and protocol changes were effective, should we have expected a lower rate of amputations overall? Such a speculative explanation appears to fall flat if you consider the relatively high amputation rates observed in both trial arms (no statistical difference between an event rate of 12.3 in the canagliflozin group and 11.2 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group). Could the amputation signal in CANVAS be a statistical anomaly (ie, a type 1 error)? That interpretation, though possible, should only be entertained cautiously if none of the above or any other plausible explanations provide clues to the singular adverse findings in CANVAS. Speculations aside, we must remember that data are data, especially when the evidence is coming from a high-quality randomized trial such as CREDENCE. Hence, the correct interpretation of the nonobservance of an amputation signal in CREDENCE may be that in real-life clinical situations, when physicians choose patients similar to those enrolled in the trial and practice regular foot care and counseling, the risk (if any) for amputations may be mitigated. Overall, CREDENCE takes the positive outcome evidence accruing for SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes (since EMPA-REG OUTCOME in 2015) to the next level, and indeed may be considered a game-changing landmark trial for diabetic kidney disease, much like the pivotal EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial for secondary cardiovascular prevention.

Researchers warn about gangrene cases in patients on SGLT2 diabetes drugs,"After the FDA last year slapped a warning label on SGLT2 diabetes drugs, detailing risks of an infection with a rare flesh-eating bacteria, a team of researchers has come out with a new set of numbers—and a warning for doctors prescribing the drugs.In a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers found patients taking SGLT2 drugs—a class that includes Johnson &amp; Johnson's Invokana, AstraZeneca's Farxiga, and Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance —suffered from 55 unique cases of Fournier's gangrene, a rare flesh-eating bacterial infection of the genitals. The cases were recorded between March 1, 2013, and January 31, 2019.The researchers collected those numbers from the FDA's adverse event reporting database. Thirty-nine patients were men and 16 were women. The rare condition was associated with severe consequences. All patients had surgery to remove unhealthy tissue and were ""severely ill."" Three patients died. Eight had fecal diversion surgery, while two others developed flesh-eating infections in lower extremities that required amputations. Like this story?

The FDA tracked 19 cases during that time frame for patients on metformin, insulin glargine, short-acting insulin, Merck's Januvia plus metformin, and Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's GLP-1 drug Trulicity. Two of those patients died.In the Annals study, researchers note they can't establish causality, and that there may be more cases that went unreported.Still, they said Fournier's gangrene is a ""newly identified safety concern"" for patients on SGLT2 drugs and warned doctors prescribing the drugs to be ""aware of this possible complication."" They also wrote that doctors should ""have a high index of suspicion to recognize it in its early stages."" The study comes as SGLT2 drugmakers are counting on those treatments for growth. Johnson &amp; Johnson's Invokana sales have been hit by an amputation warning unique in the class, but the drugmaker recently reported data in diabetes patients suffering chronic kidney disease it hopes can help right the course for the drug.For their part, Lilly and Boehringer posted strong growth for Jardiance last year. Lilly reported that sales for the drug jumped 47% last year to $658 million. AZ's Farxiga is also on the upswing, leaping 30% last year to $1.39 billion.",https://t.co/MXfvkKOg0j,news
Glenmark launches cheaper SGLT2 inhibitor class of anti-diabetes drug in India,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals on April 30 launched a novel and patented anti-diabetes drug belonging to the class of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which is said to be 50-60 percent cheaper than the existing medications of same class in the market.The drug, generically called as Remogliflozin etabonate, is used in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus in adults and was approved by Indian drug regulator CDSCO in March this year. India is the first country where the drug will be sold.According to data from IQVIA, India's diabetes market is estimated at Rs 11,413 crore for the year ended March 2019. The market size of SGLT2 inhibitors is estimated at Rs. 574 crore in the same period.The exact price of Remogliflozin isn't yet known.At present three versions of SGLT2 inhibitors are sold in India belonging to British drug maker Astrazeneca's dapagliflozin (Farxiga), US-based Janssen Pharmaceuticals canagliflozin (Invokana) and Germany-based Boehringer Ingelheim's empagliflozin (Jardiance). Their cost range anywhere between Rs 450 to Rs 550 per 10 tablets.Glenmark said it will commercialise Remogliflozin in India under brand names Remo and Remozen.SGLT2 inhibitors are third generation anti-diabetic drugs that help achieve glycemic control by acting on the SGLT2 receptors in the proximal tubule of the kidney, thereby preventing renal reabsorption of glucose and promoting excretion of glucose in the urine.SGLT2 drugs provide glycemic control, induce weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risks.Glenmark received regulatory approval for Remogliflozin 100 mg tablets, twice daily, after successfully completing Phase-3 clinical trials in which Remogliflozin demonstrated good efficacy and safety profile in a head-to-head comparison against Dapagliflozin.Remogliflozin, the latest drug in SGLT2 inhibitors' class to get regulatory approval in the world, has been studied in 26 clinical trials globally, covering around 2,500 people from various ethnicities.Remogliflozin was discovered and developed by Japanese firm Kissei Pharmaceutical and later developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Glenmark collaborator BHV Pharma, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avolynt.Glenmark secured certain rights to Remogliflozin through a licensing collaboration agreement with BHV Pharma, and conducted the Phase-3 clinical trial.""Globally, SGLT2 inhibitors are emerging as a preferred treatment for management of type-2 diabetes and Glenmark is proud to introduce a novel molecule in this class, which is cutting-edge and researched extensively. Diabetes is a key area of focus for Glenmark and with the launch of Remogliflozin, the company aims to improve access to SGLT2 inhibitors by providing an effective, high quality and world-class treatment option to patients in India,"" said Sujesh Vasudevan, President, India Formulations, Middle East and Africa at Glenmark Pharmaceuticals.The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes have recommended use of SGLT2 inhibitors as an alternative first line treatment to Metformin or as an adjunctive treatment in the management of type-2 diabetes mellitus.SGLT2 inhibitors are particularly recommended for use in patients that have certain established cardiovascular diseases.India is estimated to have around 72 million adults living with diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation's Diabetes Atlas 2017.Get Lok Sabha 2019 Live Election Results, constituency-wise tally, news, views and analysisFollow our Lok Sabha Election Result Live Blog here.",https://t.co/ny1JtAjJ8w,news
SGLT2 Inhibitors for Diabetes Linked to Rare 'Flesh-Eating' Genital Infection,"SGLT2 Inhibitors for Diabetes Linked to Rare 'Flesh-Eating' Genital InfectionMONDAY, May 6, 2019 -- Say you have type 2 diabetes and you are taking a newer class of medications to treat your disease -- but one day you notice pain, redness and a foul odor in your genital area.If this happens, new research suggests you need to see your doctor immediately, because you may be suffering from Fournier gangrene. Also known as a ""flesh-eating"" disease, this infection attacks your genital or anal region and can quickly kill tissue as it spreads rapidly.Unfortunately, it has become a rare but still possible safety concern for people taking diabetes medications known as SGLT2 inhibitors, according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists.SGLT2 inhibitors are a newer class of diabetes medications, introduced in 2013. Drugs in this class include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance) and ertugliflozin (Steglatro).Fournier gangrene occurred in 55 people taking these drugs between March 2013 and January 2019. For comparison, the researchers looked for cases of Fournier gangrene in people taking other diabetes medications from 1984 to 2019. They found only 19 such cases.Still, the risk for Fournier gangrene remains very low, the researchers stressed.""In 2017, an estimated 1.7 million patients received a dispensed prescription for an SGLT2 inhibitor,"" said study author Dr. Susan Bersoff-Matcha, a medical officer in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. So, ""Fournier gangrene is a rare event,"" she said. ""While our study shows an association between treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and Fournier gangrene, we don't know exactly what the risk is, or if Fournier gangrene can be predicted.""Broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgery to remove the dead tissue are treatment options, the researchers said.SGLT2 inhibitors work in the kidneys, allowing excess blood sugar to be removed in the urine, they said.In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, the drugs may also reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in some people with type 2 diabetes.But possible side effects include urinary tract infections and genital infections, such as yeast infections. Kidney problems can also be a concern with this class of medications.All of the patients with Fournier gangrene identified in this study needed to be hospitalized. Some had several surgeries. Three of the 55 people died from Fournier gangrene.The average age of the people with Fournier gangrene was 56. Thirty-nine were men. Forty-one cases occurred in the United States. Thirty-one of the 55 cases identified were also taking an additional diabetes medication.Of those with Fournier gangrene, 21 were using canagliflozin, 16 were using dapagliflozin and 18 were taking empagliflozin, the study said.Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, said that while the study was well-done, it cannot prove a cause-and-effect link between the drugs and the disease.""Infections of the pubic and rectal area are quite common in people with diabetes, they don't have Fournier's. Fournier's is a very aggressive, but extremely rare, disease,"" said Zonszein, who wasn't involved with the study.When Fournier gangrene does occur, it's hard to know if it is caused by a medication. He pointed out that a number of clinical trials have been done on SGLT2 inhibitors that have included tens of thousands of people, and there haven't been any reports of Fournier gangrene.""I counsel my patients about infections in the genitalia. The main concern is to be aware that they can occur. And, providers need to be more aware of Fournier's. They have to immediately try to establish the cause of infection and aggressively treat it if they suspect Fournier gangrene,"" Zonszein said.He said a far bigger concern is uncontrolled diabetes and the risk of complications when blood sugar levels aren't controlled. ""The benefits of these medications outweigh the risks,"" he said.In a statement, Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes Jardiance (empagliflozin), said the company actively monitors for side effects related to their medications.""We remain confident in the positive benefit-risk profile of empagliflozin, and empagliflozin-containing products, as outlined in the prescribing information,"" the statement from Boehringer Ingelheim said.The prescribing information of all SGLT2's was recently changed to reflect the possible risk of Fournier gangrene, as directed by the FDA.Janssen Pharmaceuticals, maker of Invokana (canagliflozin), and AstraZeneca, maker of Farxiga (dapagliflozin), did not respond to requests for comment.The findings were published May 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.More informationThe U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more about SGLT2 inhibitor medications. © 2019 HealthDay.

A Practical Approach to Hypertension Management in Diabetes,"AssessmentMeasuring blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important aspect of the clinical examination of a diabetes patient. The patient should be seated with a backrest, their feet resting on the ground, and their arm resting or supported at heart level. BP measurement should be taken with an appropriate cuff size, after 5 min of rest, taking 2–3 readings while the patient is quiet. The cuff should be next to skin, sleeve not rolled up and checked at each patient visit by a trained health care professional. Measuring BP in supine, sitting and standing positions, also enables the exclusion of possible autonomic neuropathy [4, 13].Targets and ImplicationsLowering of BP is beneficial in many ways. The UKPDS trial showed that reducing BP from 160/94 to 144/82 reduced diabetes-related mortality (BP was 154/87 in another arm of the study) [4]. The reduced morbidity from heart failure (56%) and reduced mortality from macrovascular complications (34%), as evidenced in UKPDS [5], and benefit of BP reduction in diabetes were also seen in SHEP, ALLHAT, ASCOT, and HOT trials [6, 14, 15, 16].A multifactorial approach towards the control of hypertension and hyperglycemia reduces both macro- and microvascular complications as seen in various trials (UKPDS [5], ADVANCE [7], STENO-2 [17]). Treatment of hypertension in diabetes must be individualized, depending on comorbidity, advancing age, and advancing diabetes. Treatment should begin when BP is greater than 140/90 [4, 18]. Certain subsets of hypertension in diabetes, with proteinuria and diabetic kidney disease, may benefit from further lower targets. Control of BP also significantly reduces microalbuminuria and reduces new or worsening nephropathy [7] and, thus, impacts microvascular complication. In the elderly (over 80 years old) [19, 20], a BP target of 150/90 seems appropriate (Table 1).Table 1 Summary of the various targets given by different societies for the management of hypertension in diabetes Treatment of hypertension, whether uncomplicated or complicated, with presence of albuminuria and advancing age must be tailored to real-world requirements. For albuminuria patients, targets may be stricter. Masked hypertension is also quite common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Resistant hypertension may also be present in diabetes [4, 28]. The achievement of the individualized BP goal should guide the antihypertensive medication titration, as stopping medications after the goal is reached may lead to combined micro- and macrovascular complications [29].Tight targets of systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 120 mmHg in 9361 patients aged at least 50 years old with high risk for CV events but without diabetes and with an SBP of at least 130 mmHg have shown benefits in SPRINT [30]. On the other hand, in the ACCORD BP trial [31], 4733 patients with type 2 diabetes, average age 62 years, randomly assigned to intensive therapy, targeting an SBP less than 120 mmHg, or standard therapy, targeting an SBP less than 140 mmHg, significantly reduced only stroke but not mortality or CV outcomes. The fact that treatment of hypertension helps patients with diabetes more than those who do not have diabetes in various trials, tempts us to use SPRINT data in patients with diabetes. One recent (2016) systematic review and meta-analysis [32] suggests that reducing SBP to less than 140 mmHg may be harmful in patients with diabetes. Relying on the ACCORD-BP trial, the JNC-8 [20] gave recommendations for less than 140/90, which was also accepted by others like ASH [27], AHA [26], and ADA [4].The ""J-shaped"" phenomenon (paradoxical increase in morbidity and mortality associated with an excessive reduction in BP), which created controversy, was relaunched by the fact that the excess mortality is not due to low BP per se, but due to other factors (previous stroke, ischemic heart disease, or heart failure) [33]. In this study, BP reduction to under 120 mmHg had no adverse outcomes. However, further lowering of BP needs confirmation in patients with diabetes from future trials, and we await to solve this major target controversy in the future in this subset of hypertension in patients with diabetes.Non-Pharmacological InterventionsSalt restriction, weight loss, avoiding smoking, increasing activity, and decreasing alcohol intake may all play a part in the non-pharmacological management of hypertension in diabetes [4]. Counseling is important to enable the patient to understand the necessity of prescribed drugs and to reduce non-compliance and clinic non-attendance, which also form potential management problems, affecting mortality [34]. Since the ""pill and bill"" burden affects both the individual and the family, it is important to implement family therapy, to encourage better patient care and comfort, and thus better control of the disease and its complications [35]. It helps in relieving the stress of the disease, the protection of elderly hypertensives [36], and prevention of hypertension and its complications by educating caregivers in the family, especially the educated youth [37].Home monitoring of blood pressure (HMBP) may be advantageous in control, compliance, adherence, and response to drugs. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is helpful in difficult cases, where there are differences in office and home readings, masked hypertension, and compliance issues. De-stressing strategies such as identifying stimuli and coping mechanisms are also adjuvants in hypertension treatment [38].Pharmacological InterventionsTable 2 provides the various lines of drugs used in patients with diabetes and hypertension (complicated hypertension). Table 3 summarizes the metabolic profiles of the main antihypertensive drugs including changes in glucose and lipid profile.Table 2 Summary of drugs used in patients with diabetes and hypertension [4, 11] Table 3 Metabolic profiles of different antihypertensive drugs [11] Antihypertensive Drugs 1. RAAS blockers [ACEI (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers)]: ACEI/ARBs remain the mainstay in the treatment of hypertension in a diabetes patient. They are not only beneficial in the prevention of new onset diabetes but also for albuminuria [4]. They protect kidneys by reducing efferent glomerular arteriolar tone and inhibit mesangial growth factors. ARBs are equally efficacious, with fewer side effects, although in real-world settings may be better than ACEI in stroke prevention [39]. On the basis of evidence from ALTITUDE and ONTARGET, the combined use of ACEI/ARB is discouraged [40]. RAAS blockers have benefits beyond BP lowering [41], and the drug azilsartan, the newest addition to the sartan family, provides superior reduction of BP compared to olmesartan and telmisartan [42]. 2. Diuretics [16]: Chlorthalidone and indapamide are the two most frequently used diuretics in trials for the treatment of hypertension in diabetes. Their role in preventing heart failure in patients in ALLHAT makes them an important class in this group. They may be used as first-line or as add-on treatment. Concerns are monitoring of electrolytes and glucose. 3. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) [4]: CCBs may be used as first-line treatment for hypertension in elderly patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. They may also be used in patients with intolerance to RAAS blockers. They may help in preventing stroke, but have lower efficacy than RAAS blockers. 4. Beta blockers (BB): This class of antihypertensives is used in diabetes patients with heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or tachycardia. Apart from these indications, BB are infrequently prescribed for diabetes patients. Concerns are masking hypoglycemia, impairing insulin sensitivity, weight gain, and deranged lipids [4, 43]. 5. Alpha blockers: These are used as third- or fourth-line agents, especially with prostate hyperplasia. They have less efficacy for stroke prevention and heart failure compared to other classes [16, 44]. 6. Aldosterone antagonists [45]: Used in hypertension in diabetes, e.g., spironolactone, effective in low doses, and more effective when serum potassium is less than 4.5 mmol/L. Reduce albuminuria in diabetes patients, and renoprotection is independent of systemic hemodynamic alterations. Concerns are type 4 renal tubular acidosis, hyperkalemia, impotence, and gynecomastia. Finerenone is a newer non-steroidal antimineralocorticoid with a lesser side effect profile [46]. 7. Combination of antihypertensives [4]: Initiate combination therapy if not at goal or if initial BP is greater than 160/100. Since BP in many patients with hypertension and diabetes is uncontrolled, CCB/diuretics are used as an add-on to therapy. Combining ACEI/ARB with CCB may offer better renoprotection and reduced ankle edema. Patients with volume overload or obesity do well on ACEI/ARB and diuretic combination. Patients uncontrolled on either may benefit from the triple combination of ACEI/ARB plus CCB plus diuretic. Effective combinations may be with alpha blockers and beta blockers in cases of prostatic hyperplasia and heart failure, respectively. Some patients whose BP remains uncontrolled, or with resistant hypertension, may need the further addition of aldosterone antagonists [44]. Antidiabetic Drugs as Antihypertensives 1. SGLT2i (sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) [47]: SGLT2i are novel antidiabetic drugs with antihypertensive properties. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin all have BP-reducing properties. They reduce SBP/DBP by 3–5/2–3 mmHg, respectively. The mechanisms are diuresis, nephron remodeling, reduced arterial stiffness, and weight loss. Reducing the doses of diuretics or other antihypertensive drugs is essential. This class of drugs is effective in patients with high glucose, BP, and weight [48, 49]. 2. Incretins: (a) GLP1-RA (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists): Exenatide and liraglutide significantly reduced SBP and DBP by 1–5 mmHg in a meta-analysis of 16 RCTs compared with antidiabetic drugs including insulin, glimepiride, and placebo for patients with T2DM [50]. Liraglutide [51] reduces SBP by nearly 1.5 mmHg, while the 1-mg dose of semaglutide [52] reduces it by 2.6 mmHg (p &lt; 0.01). Both drugs reduce glucose and weight in diabetes patients. They have a mild reduction effect on BP, are cardioprotective, but should not be used as an alternative to antihypertensive drugs. (b) DPP4i (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors): Sitagliptin has shown SBP reduction of 1–3 mmHg [53], while in other studies it reduced BP significantly (p &lt; 0.01) without reducing body mass index [54] and also reduced office as well as home BP (p &lt; 0.01) [55], thus confirming pleotropic effects of this class. Vildagliptin also was shown to lower central BP, which is a glucose-independent beneficial effect of gliptins [56, 57]. DPP4i have been shown to have various effects on BP, and their overall effect may be considered as neutral. Though they have pressure-reducing effects, they should not be used as an alternative to antihypertensive drugs, at present.",https://t.co/OXVz72F1Vn,news
"Albuminuria-lowering effect of dapagliflozin alone and in combination with saxagliptin and effect of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (DELIGHT): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial - The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology","Background In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive glucose control can be renoprotective and albuminuria-lowering treatments can slow the deterioration of kidney function. We assessed the albuminuria-lowering effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with and without the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor saxagliptin, and the effect of dapagliflozin–saxagliptin on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (DELIGHT), we enrolled patients at 116 research centres in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, and the USA. We included patients with a known history of type 2 diabetes, increased albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 30–3500 mg/g), an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25–75 mL/min per 1·73 m 2, and an HbA 1c of 7·0–11·0% (53–97 mmol/mol), who had been receiving stable doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy and glucose-lowering treatment for at least 12 weeks. After a 4-week, single-blind placebo run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1; via an interactive voice–web response system) to receive dapagliflozin (10 mg) only, dapagliflozin (10 mg) and saxagliptin (2·5 mg), or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks. Primary endpoints were change from baseline in UACR (dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin–saxagliptin groups) and HbA 1c (dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group) at week 24 in all randomly allocated patients with available data (full analysis set). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02547935 and is completed. Findings The study took place between July 14, 2015, and May 18, 2018. 1187 patients were screened, of whom 461 were randomly assigned: 145 to the dapagliflozin group, 155 to the dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group, and 148 to the placebo group (13 patients were excluded because of data integrity issues). Dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin–saxagliptin reduced UACR versus placebo throughout the study period. At week 24, the difference ( vs placebo; n=134 patients with available data) in mean UACR change from baseline was −21·0% (95% CI −34·1 to −5·2; p=0·011) for dapagliflozin (n=132) and −38·0% (−48·2 to −25·8; p&lt;0·0001) for dapagliflozin–saxagliptin (n=139). HbA 1c was reduced in the dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group (n=137) compared with the placebo group (n=118) at week 24 (−0·58% [−0·80 to −0·37; p&lt;0·0001]). The numbers of patients with adverse events (79 [54%] in the dapagliflozin group, 104 [68%] in the dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group, and 81 [55%] in the placebo group) or serious adverse events (12 [8%], 12 [8%], and 16 [11%], respectively) were similar across groups. There were no new drug-related safety signals. Interpretation Dapagliflozin with or without saxagliptin, given in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment, is a potentially attractive option to slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease.

Please enable JavaScript to use all the features on this page.Empagliflozin versus dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin, glimepiride and dipeptidyl peptide 4 inhibitors: A 52-week prospective observational studyAbstractAimsTo directly compare the effectiveness and safety between two distinct sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, as part of a quadruple oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D).MethodsThis study was an open-labeled, prospective, 52-week study conducted in T2D patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ranging 7.5–12.0% with metformin, glimepiride and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Patients were divided into either empagliflozin (25 mg/day) or dapagliflozin (10 mg/day). The outcome measures included changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and cardiometabolic variables and the safety profiles.ResultsIn total, 350 patients were enrolled with empagliflozin (n = 176) and dapagliflozin (n = 174), respectively. After 52 weeks, both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1c and FPG, but the reduction was greater in the empagliflozin group (P &lt; 0.001). Both groups showed significantly decreased blood pressure and body weight and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased in the empagliflozin (between groups, P = 0.035). Both groups showed similar safety profiles.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors can be effectively used as a fourth OAD in T2D patients who are treated with three other OADs. More specifically, empagliflozin was more effective in reducing HbA1c and improving other cardiometabolic parameters than dapagliflozin.Clinical Trial Number NCT03748810 (ClinicalTrials.gov).KeywordsDapagliflozinEmpagliflozinQuadruple combination antidiabetic drugsSGLT2 inhibitorType 2 diabetesRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

55 Cases of Flesh-Eating Bacterial Infections Linked to Diabetes Drug,"The flesh-eating bacterial infection known as Fournier's gangrene affects only about 1.6 per 100,000 males in the US each year. But according to a new report, that risk can be significantly higher if you are living with type 2 diabetes using a certain type of medication.The heightened risk appears to be associated with taking Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a second-line treatment for type 2 diabetes which promotes glucose excretion through the urine. While most medications carry some degree of risk for adverse events, the seriousness of Fournier's gangrene cannot go unnoticed.A new report published in Annals of Internal Medicine cites 55 cases of Fournier's gangrene among diabetics taking SGLT2 inhibitors over a seven-year period. Cases were reported within five days to 49 months of using the drugs and all patients were deemed ""severely ill"".Fournier's gangrene, also called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, is a life-threatening bacterial infection that affects the external genitalia and surrounding area. The infection rapidly progresses from tenderness and redness to tissue death possibly requiring amputation. Of the 55 cases, eight required fecal diversion surgery, two had required lower extremity amputations and three people died.SGLT2 inhibitors, first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013, are associated with other adverse events like diabetic ketoacidosis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), acute kidney injury and increased risk of bone fractures. The prevalence of these adverse events has been compiled into similar reports, each presenting mixed results. A report which examined 122 randomized controlled trials concluded that an increased risk for UTIs was the most ""plausible"" for SGLT2 inhibitors.Cases of Fournier's gangrene are extremely rare, making it difficult to explore a causal relationship. Moreover, confounding factors like underreporting and variations in reporting could impact those numbers.Despite these limitations, the FDA issued a warning last year about Fournier's gangrene, demanding all manufacturers to update their warning labels on all approved SGLT2 inhibitors. Previously, the agency had issued warnings about life-threatening blood or kidney infections originating from UTIs (2015) and acute kidney injury risk (2016).SGLT2 inhibitors still appear to be an attractive option for people with type 2 diabetes. In addition to effective glucose controls, some studies report cardiovascular benefits and weight loss as other promising features of SGLT2 inhibitors. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim all have their own versions on the market.But as more adverse events stream into the FDA database, healthcare professionals and researchers have become increasingly concerned about the drug's safety. Are drug companies manufacturing and selling these drugs despite being aware of potentially fatal side effects?These accusations form the basis of over 1,000 lawsuits accrued over several years against Johnson &amp; Johnson's Invokana (canagliflozin) and AstraZeneca's Farxiga (dapagliflozin) alone, according to drugwatch. Legal action has prompted several SGLT2 makers to reassess drug safety to win over troubled patients and boost sales.",https://t.co/7GzlqXV4C1,news
"Albuminuria-lowering effect of dapagliflozin alone and in combination with saxagliptin and effect of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (DELIGHT): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial - The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology","Background In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive glucose control can be renoprotective and albuminuria-lowering treatments can slow the deterioration of kidney function. We assessed the albuminuria-lowering effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with and without the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor saxagliptin, and the effect of dapagliflozin–saxagliptin on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (DELIGHT), we enrolled patients at 116 research centres in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, and the USA. We included patients with a known history of type 2 diabetes, increased albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 30–3500 mg/g), an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25–75 mL/min per 1·73 m 2, and an HbA 1c of 7·0–11·0% (53–97 mmol/mol), who had been receiving stable doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy and glucose-lowering treatment for at least 12 weeks. After a 4-week, single-blind placebo run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1; via an interactive voice–web response system) to receive dapagliflozin (10 mg) only, dapagliflozin (10 mg) and saxagliptin (2·5 mg), or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks. Primary endpoints were change from baseline in UACR (dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin–saxagliptin groups) and HbA 1c (dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group) at week 24 in all randomly allocated patients with available data (full analysis set). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02547935 and is completed. Findings The study took place between July 14, 2015, and May 18, 2018. 1187 patients were screened, of whom 461 were randomly assigned: 145 to the dapagliflozin group, 155 to the dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group, and 148 to the placebo group (13 patients were excluded because of data integrity issues). Dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin–saxagliptin reduced UACR versus placebo throughout the study period. At week 24, the difference ( vs placebo; n=134 patients with available data) in mean UACR change from baseline was −21·0% (95% CI −34·1 to −5·2; p=0·011) for dapagliflozin (n=132) and −38·0% (−48·2 to −25·8; p&lt;0·0001) for dapagliflozin–saxagliptin (n=139). HbA 1c was reduced in the dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group (n=137) compared with the placebo group (n=118) at week 24 (−0·58% [−0·80 to −0·37; p&lt;0·0001]). The numbers of patients with adverse events (79 [54%] in the dapagliflozin group, 104 [68%] in the dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group, and 81 [55%] in the placebo group) or serious adverse events (12 [8%], 12 [8%], and 16 [11%], respectively) were similar across groups. There were no new drug-related safety signals. Interpretation Dapagliflozin with or without saxagliptin, given in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment, is a potentially attractive option to slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease.

SGLT2 inhibitors in Type 1 Diabetes: What Are the Risks?,"My name is Simon Heller. I'm professor of clinical diabetes at the University of Sheffield in the north of England and I'm going to discuss the recent approval [EU positive opinion for type 1 diabetes] of one of the newer agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the SGLT2 inhibitors.* A number of these drugs, for example dapagliflozin (Forxiga/Farxiga/Edistride, AstraZeneca), will soon be approved for use in certain people with type 1 diabetes. These drugs are already approved for the treatment of type 2 and they've been really quite useful. They help to lower blood glucose and improve HbA1c levels. They can also reduce weight, and perhaps most interesting of all, there's some evidence that they may reduce cardiac mortality. Perhaps, and this is speculation, but there is evidence that it might be because they have effects on reducing heart failure which is an issue in type 2 diabetes. I think perhaps most interesting of all there's a suggestion that they may have benefits on the kidney, they may be what we call renoprotective, and we need to know more about that. But clearly if there were medications which prevented the complication of diabetic kidney disease, that would be fantastic. So why not use them in type 1 diabetes? The reason that there has been caution and a bit of concern is that they do, in some cases even in type 2 diabetes, cause diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a potentially lethal complication. And therefore, we need to be absolutely sure that they can be used safely. So one of the issues is that they lower glucose levels by increasing secretion of glucose in the kidney, and therefore they may require insulin levels themselves to be reduced in people who are receiving insulin treatment. And could it be that that reduction in insulin is contributing [to ketoacidosis]? I think it probably is. So is it a wise decision to allow these drugs to be used in type 1 diabetes? They clearly have potential benefits, and some patients think they're really great when they go on them. So in terms of quality of life … that's an issue. But of course, if they do increase the risk of ketoacidosis, which is potentially fatal, I think we have to be very cautious. So, I think the approval has suggested that patients should be well aware of what needs to be done. And actually we've been involved in some of the clinical trials. And we have given patients very careful instruction about checking for their ketone levels, particularly if they're not feeling well, or that glucose has crept up. But interestingly, even with all that advice, we have had a few patients who still got into mild ketoacidosis. So I think we should regard this [upcoming] approval with a bit of concern. I think if you have people with [type 1] diabetes, who are very well educated, know exactly what to do, and do everything that their doctor and nurse tells them, probably that's fine. But of course, many individuals …find that challenging to do. There are people who don't take their insulin regularly who are at risk of ketoacidosis, whose HbA1c levels are often high. And if you're going to choose those people it could increase the risk that people might get very ill, or even might die, and that is my concern. The other issue is that [SGLT2 inhibitors] are used widely by primary care physicians and in type 2 diabetes, that's generally very safe. But of course, there are people with type 1 diabetes who attend primary care clinics because they don't find it easy or rewarding to go to secondary care units where most type 1 diabetes is treated, at least in the UK. I think giving these medications to people with type 1 diabetes without careful surveillance and expert supervision does increase the risk. So I think it's likely …the use of these medications in type 1 will increase. But I think we should have some concerns and scrutinise the results, particularly those who have side effects, very carefully as we move into a new era. * A second medication, the oral SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin (Sanofi) has also recently been given an EU positive opinion , also for use in certain patients with type 1 diabetes, under strict criteria. Sotagliflozin is not approved for type 2 diabetes, however.",https://t.co/CEpLWC02xp,news
CREDENCE Takes SGLT2 Inhibitors 'to the Next Level',"The enormity of the need for better treatments for diabetic kidney disease is underscored by the fact that it has been almost 18 years since the last advancement in this area, with the advent of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers. It's not surprising, then, that considerable excitement had built up in anticipation of results from the CREDENCE trial, which were presented recently in Melbourne, Australia, at the International Society of Nephrology congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.[1] This trial shows an unequivocal benefit of canagliflozin in diabetic kidney disease, similar to the straightforward secondary prevention and cardiovascular risk reduction revealed for empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial more than 3 years ago.[2] Although the composite renal endpoint reduction (a post hoc analysis at that time) was a pleasant surprise in EMPA-REG, nephroprotection was subsequently corroborated in the CANVAS program[3] with canagliflozin, and more recently in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial[4] with dapagliflozin, albeit as a secondary outcome. Unequivocal Renal Benefits Notably, CREDENCE randomly assigned participants to receive canagliflozin or placebo on top of RAAS blocker therapy (as a mandatory study inclusion criterion), and still observed a staggering 30% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death. In addition to the statistically significant primary outcome benefit, several clinically important renal outcomes, as well as the composite major acute cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death), were reduced significantly. In a subgroup analysis, the primary composite endpoint reduction appears to be at least as robust, if not more, in the 60% of trial participants who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Nephroprotection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, especially at a low eGFR, is thought to be glucose independent. This is quite apparent in CREDENCE, where a minimal end-of-study A1c difference (0.1%) was observed between the trial arms in favor of canagliflozin. This concept of glucose-independent nephroprotection is further set to be tested in the ongoing Dapa-CKD trial and the upcoming EMPA-KIDNEY trial, both of which include a proportion of participants without diabetes. Broadly, CREDENCE is yet another positive outcome trial—with renal endpoints reported as the primary objective for the first time for an SGLT2 inhibitor—that adds weight to the ongoing paradigm shift of clinical practice guidelines toward emphasizing reduction of complications as the primary goal of diabetes management rather than focusing solely on a glucose target approach. Limitations to Consider Let me point out two limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results from CREDENCE: Further review and analyses may be necessary to provide clarity on the 27% of participants who discontinued the study drug within the median 2.6 years of follow-up. This percentage appears to be comparatively worse in CREDENCE than in most recently completed outcome trials in diabetes, which have an approximately 5% drug discontinuation rate per year. As acknowledged in the publication, one of the statistical limitations of CREDENCE is that the trial was stopped early at a planned interim analysis, which may increase the risk of overestimating effect sizes. Notwithstanding, the extremely tight (ie, small magnitude and spread) number needed to treat of 22 (95% confidence interval, 15-38) for the primary outcome over 2.5 years appears to be staggeringly clinically significant. What About the Amputation Risk? Anticipation (and anxieties) were even greater for this randomized trial to confirm (or not) the amputation and fracture signals observed in the CANVAS program. A collective sigh of relief was felt in the Melbourne presentation hall when no such increase in adverse outcomes was reported. The next pertinent question, then, is: How do we integrate the dissimilar amputation results in the cardiovascular versus kidney disease outcome trial programs of canagliflozin? Here are a few speculative guesses: Could differing populations have resulted in the observed amputation risk differential? Notably, unlike CANVAS, CREDENCE used only the lower dose of canagliflozin. Could this difference in study protocol, together with the less potent glucose lowering with canagliflozin at lower eGFR (and possibly less diuresis as a result), explain the discrepancy? Could practice and trial protocol adaptations after the CANVAS amputation revelations have influenced the subsequent amputation risk differential among the trial arms in CREDENCE? In addition to a more careful and comprehensive prospective assessment of foot complications (including full foot exams) mandated by a protocol amendment, investigators were recommended to interrupt study medication for any significant foot-related condition associated with amputations (including lower-extremity infection, skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, and critical limb ischemia) until the condition resolves. However, if indeed the above practice and protocol changes were effective, should we have expected a lower rate of amputations overall? Such a speculative explanation appears to fall flat if you consider the relatively high amputation rates observed in both trial arms (no statistical difference between an event rate of 12.3 in the canagliflozin group and 11.2 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group). Could the amputation signal in CANVAS be a statistical anomaly (ie, a type 1 error)? That interpretation, though possible, should only be entertained cautiously if none of the above or any other plausible explanations provide clues to the singular adverse findings in CANVAS. Speculations aside, we must remember that data are data, especially when the evidence is coming from a high-quality randomized trial such as CREDENCE. Hence, the correct interpretation of the nonobservance of an amputation signal in CREDENCE may be that in real-life clinical situations, when physicians choose patients similar to those enrolled in the trial and practice regular foot care and counseling, the risk (if any) for amputations may be mitigated. Overall, CREDENCE takes the positive outcome evidence accruing for SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes (since EMPA-REG OUTCOME in 2015) to the next level, and indeed may be considered a game-changing landmark trial for diabetic kidney disease, much like the pivotal EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial for secondary cardiovascular prevention.

SGLT2 inhibitors prevent HF hospitalization regardless of baseline LVEF,"NEW ORLEANS – Patients who have type 2 diabetes and are taking a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor have lower risks of heart failure hospitalization and all-cause mortality than patients on other glucose-lowering drugs regardless of whether their baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is preserved or reduced, based on data from a large real-world patient registry.""The observed beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure may extend across the range of baseline ejection fractions,"" Mikhail Kosiborod, MD, observed at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology.This is an important new insight. The major randomized cardiovascular outcome trials that showed lower risks of heart failure hospitalization and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetic patients on an SGLT2 inhibitor, such as EMPA-REG OUTCOME for empagliflozin (Jardiance) and CANVAS for canagliflozin (Invokana), didn't include information on baseline LVEF. So until now it has been unclear whether the beneficial effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors preventing heart failure hospitalization vary depending upon LVEF, explained Dr. Kosiborod, a cardiologist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Mo.He presented an analysis drawn from the patient database kept by Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel. The study included 5,307 patients with type 2 diabetes and an LVEF measurement recorded in their chart at the time they started on either empagliflozin or dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and an equal number of propensity-matched type 2 diabetic controls who started on other glucose-lowering drugs, most commonly an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor.During roughly 16,000 person-years of follow-up, 239 deaths occurred. Compared with patients on another glucose-lowering drug, the risk of death from all causes was reduced by 47% among patients who were on an SGLT2 inhibitor and had a baseline LVEF of 50% or greater and by 62% among the 9% of subjects who had a baseline LVEF less than 50%.Similarly, the risk of heart failure hospitalization was reduced by 29% in SGLT2 inhibitor users with a preserved LVEF and by 27% if they had a reduced LVEF.For the composite endpoint of heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality, the risk reductions associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy were 45% with preserved and 39% with reduced LVEF.Session comoderator Prakash C. Deedwania, MD, noted that there are ongoing major randomized trials of various SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with known heart failure, with cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization as primary endpoints. He asked Dr. Kosiborod whether, given that the results of these studies aren't in yet, he thinks clinicians should be prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to diabetic or prediabetic patients who don't have clinical symptoms of heart failure but may have a marker of increased risk, such as an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide.""At least in my mind, we have more than enough evidence at this point to say that SGLT2 inhibitors are effective in preventing heart failure,"" Dr. Kosiborod replied.""Obviously, if your risk for developing a condition is higher at baseline, then the absolute benefit that you're going to get from using an agent that's effective in preventing that event is going to be higher and the number needed to treat is going to be lower. So if you have a patient at high risk for heart failure by whatever risk predictor you're using and the patient doesn't yet have heart failure but does have diabetes, which is already a risk factor for heart failure, I think we have pretty solid data now that SGLT2 inhibitors will likely be effective in preventing heart failure in that kind of patient population. But I don't think we have definitive data at this point to say that the drugs are effective in treating heart failure in people who already have a manifest clinical syndrome of heart failure, which is why we're doing all these clinical trials now,"" he continued.Dr. Deedwania urged audience members to make the effort to become comfortable in prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors for their patients with type 2 diabetes.""Many different surveys show that these drugs are not being utilized effectively by cardiologists,"" noted Dr. Deedwania, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and director of the heart failure program at the university's Fresno campus.""As cardiologists, we may not want to own diabetes, but we at least have to feel that we have the ownership of treating the diabetic patient with cardiovascular disease with appropriate drugs. We don't need to depend on endocrinologists because if we do these patients may become lost,"" he said.Dr. Kosiborod concurred, citing evidence that diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease are much more likely to see a cardiologist than an endocrinologist in the course of usual care.""There's definitely a golden opportunity here to intervene to reduce risk,"" he said.Dr. Kosiborod reported serving as a consultant to roughly a dozen pharmaceutical companies.bjancin@mdedge.com SOURCE: Kosiborod M.

SGLT2 Inhibitors: Pros and Cons for Type 2 Diabetics,"You have several options for treating type 2 diabetes, and you and your healthcare team may consider using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors). Several studies, including one published in January 2019 in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), have suggested these drugs have heart benefits, which is welcome news because many people with diabetes are at a higher risk for heart disease and stroke compared with the general population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).SLGT2 inhibitors work differently from other medicines used to control blood glucose. In the kidneys, they prevent glucose from being reabsorbed from your urine back into your blood. This reduces blood glucose, and improves your A1C, the two- to three-month average of your blood sugar levels that can indicate how well diabetes is being controlled. ""These medicines block the transporter that allows the kidneys to reabsorb glucose,"" says Evan Sisson, PharmD, CDE, a pharmacist and associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. He adds that this can lower glucose in the bloodstream and flush out excess glucose in urine.The following SGLT2 inhibitors are available on the market, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA):Yet, as with any prescription drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors carry certain risks, including infection, the FDA points out.""Lowering blood sugar in and of itself is important in that it helps to prevent some of the complications of diabetes, particularly eye disease and kidney disease, and peripheral nerve disease,"" says Stephen D. Wiviott, MD, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""More recently, some classes of drugs, and SGLT2 inhibitors in particular, have demonstrated favorable effects on the heart and the progression of kidney disease as well.""RELATED: The Top Diabetes Treatments for Better Blood Sugar ControlHow SGLT2 Inhibitors May Boost Your Heart Health""The big news in recent years has been the cardiovascular benefits that go with these medications,"" says Dr. Sisson.Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people with diabetes, notes the CDC, so drugs that can both lower blood glucose and preserve heart health are critical, experts say. Three large studies have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors have a clear cardiovascular benefit, says Dr. Wiviott, who was involved with this research.First, SGLT2 inhibitors may help people with type 2 diabetes who already have heart disease, according to an empagliflozin study published in November 2015 in The NEJM and a canagliflozin study published in August 2017 in The NEJM. Both studies suggested the drugs may reduce the likelihood of having another heart attack, stroke, or dying from heart disease. The American Diabetes Association's guidelines, published in January 2019 in the journal Diabetes Care, recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for people with diabetes who have been diagnosed with heart disease or who are at high risk for heart disease.Second, the aforementioned January 2019 study in The NEJM suggested that the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin helps people with diabetes from being hospitalized for heart failure, regardless of whether they had heart disease in the past or not, says Wiviott.Why so much focus on the heart? In 2008, the FDA ensured that all diabetes drugs undergo studies to show their heart safety, says Daniel Hsia, MD, assistant professor at Louisiana State University's Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. Since then, research into SGLT2 inhibitors and another class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, including liraglutide and semaglutide, has shown no heart harm — and some heart rewards, according to one study published in July 2016 in The NEJM and another study, published in November 2016 in The NEJM.RELATED: 3 Ways Taking an SGLT2 Inhibitor Has Changed How I Manage DiabetesWhy SGLT2 Inhibitors May Increase Your Risk for Urinary Tract Infections Remember how SGLT2 inhibitors increase glucose in your urine? Well, excess sugar in your urine creates a cozy environment for bacteria and fungi to thrive in your urinary tract or genital area. People with diabetes are already at high risk for these infections, says Dr. Hsia. ""The incidence of urinary tract infections is about 50 perent greater in people with diabetes compared with people without diabetes,"" he says. ""Genital infections are 2 to 3 times more likely to occur in people with diabetes compared with those without diabetes,"" says Hsia.Wiviott says that there is a risk for genital infections for both men and women taking SGLT2 inhibitors, and these infections tend to be mild and easily treated with antibiotics. Tell your doctor if you have a history of these infections.Another more serious but rare form of infection has been reported in people taking SGLT2 inhibitors, called Fournier's gangrene, in which bacteria infect the underlying layers of skin of the genitals. In August 2018, the FDA warned that 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported in the past five years, and noted that patients should get attention immediately if they have symptoms of tenderness, redness, or swelling in their genital area. ""These symptoms can worsen quickly, so it is important to seek treatment right away, as it can be a life-threatening bacterial infection,"" says Hsia.Hsia points out that any and all drugs have risks, and that the risks of SGLT2 inhibitors must be balanced against their dual potential benefits for blood glucose and heart disease. The SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin carries a warning for increased risk of amputations, and the FDA has also warned about diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious and sometimes deadly condition in which high blood glucose, called hyperglycemia, over a long period of time causes a buildup of toxic ketones in the blood. SGLT2s are notorious for causing euglycemic DKA, a buildup of ketones in the blood even with normal blood sugar levels, meaning this health emergency doesn't only occur with hyperglycemia, noted an article published in September 2015 in the journal Diabetes Care. Sisson says SGLT2 inhibitors can also increase the risk for dehydration, especially in the summertime.RELATED: 10 Tips to Help You Take Your Diabetes Medications on TimeWho May Benefit From Taking SGLT2 Inhibitors — and Why""It's reasonable for patients who have cardiovascular disease or who are at risk for cardiovascular disease, either because they are older or have other risk factors … to talk to their physicians about whether these types of drugs might be right for them,"" says Wiviott. He adds that other risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco use, or a family history of heart disease.SGLT2 inhibitors can be a nice add-on medication for people who already take metformin for type 2 diabetes, who may also be at risk for heart failure, says Sisson. Other second-line treatments, such as sulfonylureas, may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and episodes of severe low blood glucose, according to a study published in July 2018 study in the journal BMJ.Sisson and Wivott both say these new drugs can cause providers to think beyond their specialties of cardiology or endocrinology. Good communication between different members of your healthcare team, including physicians, pharmacists, and diabetes educators, can help you choose the best medication, says Sisson. You might ask your team: Which medication gives the biggest bang for my buck? As a pharmacist and diabetes educator with the American Association of Diabetes Educators, Sisson points out the value of taking fewer medicines to cut costs and improve the likelihood that people stick to their medication regimen.RELATED: Second-Line Sulfonylureas May Pose Heart Risks for People With Type 2 Diabetes",https://t.co/TaLz03P02u,news

Less HF Hospitalization on Dapagliflozin in Diabetes at Any LVEF,"NEW ORLEANS — Patients with type 2 diabetes who received dapagliflozin (Farxiga/Forxiga, AstraZeneca) in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial showed a reduced risk for heart-failure (HF) hospitalization, regardless of their baseline left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Also, patients with an LVEF below 45% treated with the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, compared with placebo control subjects, had lower all-cause mortality and fewer cardiovascular (CV) deaths in the prespecified secondary analysis of the randomized trial. DECLARE-TIMI 58 had compared dapagliflozin wth placebo in about 17,000 patients with diabetes, including 7000 with established CV disease and 10,000 without CV disease but with multiple CV risk factors, all on a background of standard medical therapy. In the trial's primary analysis reported last year, those treated with dapagliflozin showed a significant 27% reduced risk for the secondary end point of HF hospitalization over a median follow-up of 4.2 years. The drug also seemed renoprotective in this group. The current analysis tries to tease out the possible benefits of dapagliflozin by HF history and LVEF, and notably suggests that the drug reduced the risk for HF hospitalization in patients, many with HF and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), observed Eri T. Kato, MD, MPH, PhD, Kyoto Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. ""I want to emphasize that dapagliflozin reduced hospitalization for heart failure regardless of ejection fraction,"" she said. So, although there was no survival benefit in patients without HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), there is at least some important clinical benefit in all the patients. ""We all know there are only a few therapies that would improve cardiac outcomes in HFpEF patients, so the fact that we saw a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure in HFpEF patients is important and huge."" Kata presented the DECLARE-TIMI 58 secondary analysis during a late-breaking clinical trial session and press briefing at the recent American College of Cardiology 68th Annual Scientific Session (ACC.19). She is also lead author on the study's simultaneous publication in Circulation. Not the Final Word Kato acknowledged that the analysis has limitations that make it far from conclusive, including the fact that the trial wasn't an HF trial per se and LVEF was not consistently measured. ""The objective of this study was not really heart failure, and I found that the number of patients with reduced ejection fraction was rather small, agreed Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York City, the assigned discussant at the press briefing. So, he added, ""I would call these preliminary data."" Also, the analysis categorized patients in unconventional ways. For example, it defined patients with HFrEF, 3.9% of the total trial population, as having an LVEF below 45% whether or not there was also a history of clinical HF. Of the remaining patients — classified as non-HFrEF — 7.7% had a history of clinical HF and 88.4% had no clinical history of HF. However, in both of these groups, there was no documentation that LVEF was below 45%, which could mean that LVEF was at least 45% or that LVEF was not documented. Studies like this one, ""that is, thought-provoking or hypothesis-generating,"" help clinicians identify which patients would be most likely to benefit from a therapy, press briefing moderator and ACC.19 vice chair Pamela Morris, MD, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, commented to theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology. The current DECLARE-TIMI 58 analysis, she said, ""would suggest that our HFrEF patients are going to be those we should really think hard about prescribing an SGLT2 inhibitor to."" Agreeing, coauthor and press-briefing panelist Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, said: ""I think it provides some insight into how SGLT2 inhibitors — I think it is a class effect — can reduce heart failure hospitalization across the full spectrum of patients with diabetes."" And as ""the icing on the cake,"" he said, ""there appears to be a reduction in all-cause mortality, largely confined to patients who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction."" The current study isn't ""the definitive word"" on whether SLGT2 inhibitors can prolong survival in patients with HFpEF, Bhatt said. ""But if I had to bet, this provides a pretty strong signal to me that a lot of the benefit in terms of hard events and end points might be in those with worse ejection fractions."" But, ""that doesn't diminish the importance in those with HFpEF or in those with no heart failure at all."" Class Effect? Treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, empagliflozin (Jardiance, Boehringer Ingelheim), or canagliflozin (Invokana, Vokanamet, Janssen), which lower glucose levels by inhibiting renal absorption, has been associated with decreased risk for CV death or HF hospitalization for heart failure. Those were the findings in DECLARE-TIMI 58 and the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials, respectively. In the current analysis, there was a 36% reduction in HF hospitalization in the patients with HFrEF who received dapagliflozin compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.95) and a 24% reduction in the non-HFrEF group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62 - 0.92). In the group with HFrEF as defined in the analysis, those receiving dapagliflozin had an HR of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.34 - 0.90) for CV death and an HR of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.88) for death from any cause. That means, the report states, that only 16 patients with type 2 diabetes and HFrEF would need to be treated for 4 years to prevent one death from any cause, and only 19 such patients to prevent one CV death. However, non-HFrEF patients who received dapagliflozin or placebo showed a similar risk for CV death (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.89 - 1.31) and for death from any cause (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86 - 1.10). Dapagliflozin, which has diuretic properties, was not associated with an increase in risk for serious adverse events, symptoms from volume depletion, or acute renal failure in either of the HF groups. Other Questions ""At baseline, less than half of the people were on a looped diuretic, and these are patients who have HFrEF,"" said Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, MD, Northwestern University, Chicago, alluding to what seemed to be diuretic undertreatment in that group. ""So is this drug just more furosemide, or some furosemide, for patients who maybe should have been on it anyway?"" asked Lloyd-Jones from the panel after Kato's formal presentation of the analysis. Other research suggests that dapagliflozin has a multifaceted mechanism of action, not just a diuretic effect, Kato replied. ""In patients with diabetes who have had a prior myocardial infarction, the use of an SGLT2 inhibitor should be strongly considered as part of routine secondary prevention. In these individuals, SGLT2 inhibitors will reduce ischemic, heart failure, and renal events, benefits which appear to be mediated largely via glucose-independent mechanisms,"" an accompanying editorial states. ""Whether patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome can also be treated safely and effectively with a SGLT2 inhibitor has not been studied, and a definitive recommendation cannot be given,"" write authors Subodh Verma, MD, PhD, University of Toronto, and John J.V. McMurray, MB, MD, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom. ""As for patients with heart failure, especially heart failure with preserved EF, we suggest waiting for the results of the dedicated studies with SGLT2 inhibitors which are ongoing in people with heart failure (and chronic kidney disease)."" Among those trials, Kato observed, are the Dapa-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced trials in patients with HFrEF, and the DELIVER, PRESERVED-HF, and EMPEROR-Preserved trials in patients with HFpEF. ""The ongoing trials,"" Verma and McMurray suggest, ""will also answer the two remaining questions about the potential use of these drugs in patients with heart failure —can they be used in patients without diabetes and can they be used in patients hospitalized with acute decompensation?"" DECLARE-TIMI 58 was funded by AstraZeneca.

SGLT2 inhibitors in Type 1 Diabetes: What Are the Risks?,"My name is Simon Heller. I'm professor of clinical diabetes at the University of Sheffield in the north of England and I'm going to discuss the recent approval [EU positive opinion for type 1 diabetes] of one of the newer agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the SGLT2 inhibitors.* A number of these drugs, for example dapagliflozin (Forxiga/Farxiga/Edistride, AstraZeneca), will soon be approved for use in certain people with type 1 diabetes. These drugs are already approved for the treatment of type 2 and they've been really quite useful. They help to lower blood glucose and improve HbA1c levels. They can also reduce weight, and perhaps most interesting of all, there's some evidence that they may reduce cardiac mortality. Perhaps, and this is speculation, but there is evidence that it might be because they have effects on reducing heart failure which is an issue in type 2 diabetes. I think perhaps most interesting of all there's a suggestion that they may have benefits on the kidney, they may be what we call renoprotective, and we need to know more about that. But clearly if there were medications which prevented the complication of diabetic kidney disease, that would be fantastic. So why not use them in type 1 diabetes? The reason that there has been caution and a bit of concern is that they do, in some cases even in type 2 diabetes, cause diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a potentially lethal complication. And therefore, we need to be absolutely sure that they can be used safely. So one of the issues is that they lower glucose levels by increasing secretion of glucose in the kidney, and therefore they may require insulin levels themselves to be reduced in people who are receiving insulin treatment. And could it be that that reduction in insulin is contributing [to ketoacidosis]? I think it probably is. So is it a wise decision to allow these drugs to be used in type 1 diabetes? They clearly have potential benefits, and some patients think they're really great when they go on them. So in terms of quality of life … that's an issue. But of course, if they do increase the risk of ketoacidosis, which is potentially fatal, I think we have to be very cautious. So, I think the approval has suggested that patients should be well aware of what needs to be done. And actually we've been involved in some of the clinical trials. And we have given patients very careful instruction about checking for their ketone levels, particularly if they're not feeling well, or that glucose has crept up. But interestingly, even with all that advice, we have had a few patients who still got into mild ketoacidosis. So I think we should regard this [upcoming] approval with a bit of concern. I think if you have people with [type 1] diabetes, who are very well educated, know exactly what to do, and do everything that their doctor and nurse tells them, probably that's fine. But of course, many individuals …find that challenging to do. There are people who don't take their insulin regularly who are at risk of ketoacidosis, whose HbA1c levels are often high. And if you're going to choose those people it could increase the risk that people might get very ill, or even might die, and that is my concern. The other issue is that [SGLT2 inhibitors] are used widely by primary care physicians and in type 2 diabetes, that's generally very safe. But of course, there are people with type 1 diabetes who attend primary care clinics because they don't find it easy or rewarding to go to secondary care units where most type 1 diabetes is treated, at least in the UK. I think giving these medications to people with type 1 diabetes without careful surveillance and expert supervision does increase the risk. So I think it's likely …the use of these medications in type 1 will increase. But I think we should have some concerns and scrutinise the results, particularly those who have side effects, very carefully as we move into a new era. * A second medication, the oral SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin (Sanofi) has also recently been given an EU positive opinion , also for use in certain patients with type 1 diabetes, under strict criteria.

SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes: a patent review (2013-2018).,"SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes: a patent review (2013-2018).Summary of ""SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes: a patent review (2013-2018).""The sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) is ascribed to target renal tubular glucose re-absorption, and its inhibition has been proved to induce glucosuria which improves the glycemic index. Accordingly, SGLT2 inhibitors have found to be the promising class of antidiabetic agents for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A large number of SGLT2 inhibitors have developed through structural modification and investigated for their ability to selectivity inhibit SGLT2 transporters with better bioavailability. Areas covered: This review comprises a summary of patent applications (2013 - 2018) of SGLT2 inhibitors with focus on chemical structural advancement and therapeutic potentials in the management of diabetes and related disorders. Expert opinion: SGLT2 inhibitors exert multiple metabolic benefits, including reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), improved glycemic control (fasting and postprandial), reduced body weight, reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure and improved HDL cholesterol. Due to the virtue of no interference with insulin action and secretion, their efficacy remains the same even in presence of progressive β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, few members of this class have been reported to exhibit cardioprotective, renoprotective and anticancer activity. However, more study on the long term outcomes in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors is warranted.AffiliationJournal DetailsThis article was published in the following journal.Name: Expert opinion on therapeutic patentsISSN: 1744-7674Pages: Links Medical and Biotech [MESH] DefinitionsConcurrent ReviewReview of the medical necessity of hospital or other health facility admissions, upon or within a short time following an admission, and periodic review of services provided during the course of treatment.Persistent Fetal Circulation SyndromeA syndrome of persistent PULMONARY HYPERTENSION in the newborn infant (INFANT, NEWBORN) without demonstrable HEART DISEASES.

Researchers warn about gangrene cases in patients on SGLT2 diabetes drugs,"After the FDA last year slapped a warning label on SGLT2 diabetes drugs, detailing risks of an infection with a rare flesh-eating bacteria, a team of researchers has come out with a new set of numbers—and a warning for doctors prescribing the drugs.In a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers found patients taking SGLT2 drugs—a class that includes Johnson &amp; Johnson's Invokana, AstraZeneca's Farxiga, and Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance —suffered from 55 unique cases of Fournier's gangrene, a rare flesh-eating bacterial infection of the genitals. The cases were recorded between March 1, 2013, and January 31, 2019.The researchers collected those numbers from the FDA's adverse event reporting database. Thirty-nine patients were men and 16 were women. The rare condition was associated with severe consequences. All patients had surgery to remove unhealthy tissue and were ""severely ill."" Three patients died. Eight had fecal diversion surgery, while two others developed flesh-eating infections in lower extremities that required amputations. Like this story?

SGLT2 Inhibitors: Pros and Cons for Type 2 Diabetics,"You have several options for treating type 2 diabetes, and you and your healthcare team may consider using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors). Several studies, including one published in January 2019 in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), have suggested these drugs have heart benefits, which is welcome news because many people with diabetes are at a higher risk for heart disease and stroke compared with the general population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).SLGT2 inhibitors work differently from other medicines used to control blood glucose. In the kidneys, they prevent glucose from being reabsorbed from your urine back into your blood. This reduces blood glucose, and improves your A1C, the two- to three-month average of your blood sugar levels that can indicate how well diabetes is being controlled. ""These medicines block the transporter that allows the kidneys to reabsorb glucose,"" says Evan Sisson, PharmD, CDE, a pharmacist and associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. He adds that this can lower glucose in the bloodstream and flush out excess glucose in urine.The following SGLT2 inhibitors are available on the market, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA):Yet, as with any prescription drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors carry certain risks, including infection, the FDA points out.""Lowering blood sugar in and of itself is important in that it helps to prevent some of the complications of diabetes, particularly eye disease and kidney disease, and peripheral nerve disease,"" says Stephen D. Wiviott, MD, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""More recently, some classes of drugs, and SGLT2 inhibitors in particular, have demonstrated favorable effects on the heart and the progression of kidney disease as well.""RELATED: The Top Diabetes Treatments for Better Blood Sugar ControlHow SGLT2 Inhibitors May Boost Your Heart Health""The big news in recent years has been the cardiovascular benefits that go with these medications,"" says Dr. Sisson.Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people with diabetes, notes the CDC, so drugs that can both lower blood glucose and preserve heart health are critical, experts say. Three large studies have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors have a clear cardiovascular benefit, says Dr. Wiviott, who was involved with this research.First, SGLT2 inhibitors may help people with type 2 diabetes who already have heart disease, according to an empagliflozin study published in November 2015 in The NEJM and a canagliflozin study published in August 2017 in The NEJM. Both studies suggested the drugs may reduce the likelihood of having another heart attack, stroke, or dying from heart disease. The American Diabetes Association's guidelines, published in January 2019 in the journal Diabetes Care, recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for people with diabetes who have been diagnosed with heart disease or who are at high risk for heart disease.Second, the aforementioned January 2019 study in The NEJM suggested that the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin helps people with diabetes from being hospitalized for heart failure, regardless of whether they had heart disease in the past or not, says Wiviott.Why so much focus on the heart? In 2008, the FDA ensured that all diabetes drugs undergo studies to show their heart safety, says Daniel Hsia, MD, assistant professor at Louisiana State University's Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. Since then, research into SGLT2 inhibitors and another class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, including liraglutide and semaglutide, has shown no heart harm — and some heart rewards, according to one study published in July 2016 in The NEJM and another study, published in November 2016 in The NEJM.RELATED: 3 Ways Taking an SGLT2 Inhibitor Has Changed How I Manage DiabetesWhy SGLT2 Inhibitors May Increase Your Risk for Urinary Tract Infections Remember how SGLT2 inhibitors increase glucose in your urine? Well, excess sugar in your urine creates a cozy environment for bacteria and fungi to thrive in your urinary tract or genital area. People with diabetes are already at high risk for these infections, says Dr. Hsia. ""The incidence of urinary tract infections is about 50 perent greater in people with diabetes compared with people without diabetes,"" he says. ""Genital infections are 2 to 3 times more likely to occur in people with diabetes compared with those without diabetes,"" says Hsia.Wiviott says that there is a risk for genital infections for both men and women taking SGLT2 inhibitors, and these infections tend to be mild and easily treated with antibiotics. Tell your doctor if you have a history of these infections.Another more serious but rare form of infection has been reported in people taking SGLT2 inhibitors, called Fournier's gangrene, in which bacteria infect the underlying layers of skin of the genitals. In August 2018, the FDA warned that 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported in the past five years, and noted that patients should get attention immediately if they have symptoms of tenderness, redness, or swelling in their genital area. ""These symptoms can worsen quickly, so it is important to seek treatment right away, as it can be a life-threatening bacterial infection,"" says Hsia.Hsia points out that any and all drugs have risks, and that the risks of SGLT2 inhibitors must be balanced against their dual potential benefits for blood glucose and heart disease. The SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin carries a warning for increased risk of amputations, and the FDA has also warned about diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious and sometimes deadly condition in which high blood glucose, called hyperglycemia, over a long period of time causes a buildup of toxic ketones in the blood. SGLT2s are notorious for causing euglycemic DKA, a buildup of ketones in the blood even with normal blood sugar levels, meaning this health emergency doesn't only occur with hyperglycemia, noted an article published in September 2015 in the journal Diabetes Care. Sisson says SGLT2 inhibitors can also increase the risk for dehydration, especially in the summertime.RELATED: 10 Tips to Help You Take Your Diabetes Medications on TimeWho May Benefit From Taking SGLT2 Inhibitors — and Why""It's reasonable for patients who have cardiovascular disease or who are at risk for cardiovascular disease, either because they are older or have other risk factors … to talk to their physicians about whether these types of drugs might be right for them,"" says Wiviott. He adds that other risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco use, or a family history of heart disease.SGLT2 inhibitors can be a nice add-on medication for people who already take metformin for type 2 diabetes, who may also be at risk for heart failure, says Sisson. Other second-line treatments, such as sulfonylureas, may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and episodes of severe low blood glucose, according to a study published in July 2018 study in the journal BMJ.Sisson and Wivott both say these new drugs can cause providers to think beyond their specialties of cardiology or endocrinology. Good communication between different members of your healthcare team, including physicians, pharmacists, and diabetes educators, can help you choose the best medication, says Sisson. You might ask your team: Which medication gives the biggest bang for my buck? As a pharmacist and diabetes educator with the American Association of Diabetes Educators, Sisson points out the value of taking fewer medicines to cut costs and improve the likelihood that people stick to their medication regimen.RELATED: Second-Line Sulfonylureas May Pose Heart Risks for People With Type 2 Diabetes",https://t.co/Y7ZUzewzzd,news

Visualization of ligand-induced transmembrane signaling in the full-length human insulin receptor,"IntroductionThe insulin receptor (IR) is a ubiquitously expressed receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is of fundamental importance for the regulation of glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism and growth (Saltiel and Kahn, 2001). Its dysfunction has been linked to severe pathologies including diabetes mellitus, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease (Haeusler et al., 2018).In the canonical model of RTK signaling, receptor activation is mediated by ligand-induced dimerization and oligomerization (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990). However, a subset of RTKs can form noncovalent but inactive dimers before ligand binding (Maruyama, 2014; Freed et al., 2015). IRs are unique among RTKs in that they exclusively exist as covalently linked (αβ)2 homodimers at the cell surface (Fig. 1 A). Independent of their oligomeric state, all RTKs are activated by their cognate ligands, arguing that distinct allosteric changes within the dimeric receptor structure may contribute to receptor activation and signaling outcome (Maruyama, 2014; Freed et al., 2017).Figure 1.

Experimental details are provided in the In vitro phosphorylation assay and SDS-PAGE and Western blots sections in Materials and methods as well as Figs. S1 and S2.Our structural understanding of IRs derives largely from crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies of receptor fragments (Hubbard et al., 1994; McKern et al., 2006; Menting et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Cabail et al., 2015; Croll et al., 2016), most notably those of an unliganded ectodomain (Croll et al., 2016) and a truncated ectodomain in complex with insulin (Menting et al., 2013). Attempts to image full-length IRs by EM yielded inconclusive results and did not reveal ligand-dependent structural changes (De Meyts and Whittaker, 2002), leaving the structural basis for transmembrane signaling to be elucidated (De Meyts, 2015; Tatulian, 2015).To obtain insights into IR activation, we reconstituted recombinant full-length IR into lipid nanodiscs and visualized them by single-particle EM. In the absence of insulin, the IR ectodomain adopted the symmetric inverted U-shaped conformation described in previous studies of the ectodomain (Tulloch et al., 1999; McKern et al., 2006; Croll et al., 2016). Upon insulin binding, however, the receptor ectodomain converted into a T-shaped conformation that brought the transmembrane domains together, presumably facilitating autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domains.Results and discussionTo elucidate the mechanism underlying transmembrane IR signaling, we produced recombinant full-length human (αβ)2 IRs (Fig. 1 A) in freestyle HEK293F cells, purified them in CHAPS to near-homogeneity by a single affinity chromatography step, and used membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs; Denisov et al., 2004; Schuler et al., 2013) to reconstitute them into lipid nanodiscs (Fig. 1, B and C; and Fig. S1). For reconstitution, we used a ternary lipid mixture consisting of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol at a ratio that forms homogeneous membranes in the liquid-disordered phase (Tumaneng et al., 2010). Assaying kinase activity upon exposure to insulin demonstrated increased autophosphorylation activity over basal levels for both the detergent-solubilized and the nanodisc-embedded IR (Figs. 1 D and S2), although the latter exhibited considerably higher background activity.Inactive IRs exhibit an inverted U-shaped ectodomain conformation and well-separated transmembrane domainsFull-length IRs were first reconstituted with MSP1E3D1, an MSP variant that forms nanodiscs of ∼12 nm in diameter (Denisov et al., 2007), and the resulting structures were imaged by negative-stain EM. Although heterogeneous, many particles showed circular shapes representing nanodiscs, from which additional densities extended (Fig. S3 A). About 10,000 interactively selected particles were subjected to K-means classification into 200 classes (Fig. S3 B) and to iterative stable alignment and clustering (ISAC; Fig. S3 C; for classification details, see Table S1). K-means classification assigns every particle to one of the specified number of classes and can therefore be used to quantify particle populations (see numbers throughout the study). ISAC only uses a subset of the particles, namely those that fall into stable and reproducible classes. ISAC is thus not suitable to quantify particle populations, but it produces averages with very reliable and crisp features (for more details, see Yang et al., 2012). Some ISAC averages revealed an L-shaped density extending from a nanodisc (Fig. S3 C), presumably representing unprocessed monomeric IRs (see Fig. 2 for an interpretation of the 2D class averages in terms of the 3D structures they likely represent). Because monomeric IRs do not exist at the cell surface under physiological conditions (Hedo et al., 1983), they will not be discussed further. Many ISAC averages showed an inverted U-shaped density that either extended from a single nanodisc (20%; see the Image processing section of Materials and methods for estimation of particle populations; Fig. 3 A, top) or connected two nanodiscs (80%; Fig. 3 A, bottom). The width of the U-shaped density (∼8–11 nm) was consistent with the respective IR ectodomain dimension seen in a previous negative-stain EM study (Tulloch et al., 1999) and in crystal structures (McKern et al., 2006; Croll et al., 2016). The unliganded ectodomain extended 8.5–10 nm from the edge of the nanodiscs, which presumably is an underestimation of the total length of the ectodomain because the nanodisc density makes it impossible to identify the precise position where the protein emerges from the membrane. However, as most IR dimers reconstituted into two separate nanodiscs, the two transmembrane domains must generally be well separated from each other in unliganded receptors.Figure 2. Schematic illustration of the conformations assigned to IRs in nanodiscs. (A and B) Representative class averages (A) and schematic drawings (B) of IRs in nanodiscs adopting different conformations: U-shaped dimer (ectodomain in red) in one (1U) or two nanodiscs (2U), T-shaped dimer (ectodomain in blue) in one (1T and II) or two nanodiscs (2U), and L-shaped monomer (ectodomain in dark gray) in one nanodisc (L). (C) Models of how the nanodisc-embedded IRs may look in solution. Because the tyrosine kinase domains are flexibly tethered to the transmembrane domains, their locations are somewhat speculative, especially in the 2T conformation. Note, however, that extra density in the class averages of the 1T and II conformations may represent tyrosine kinase domain dimers.Figure 3. Selected EM averages of IRs reconstituted into MSP1E3D1 nanodiscs and ligand-induced IR activation. (A) In the absence of insulin, IRs reconstituted into one nanodisc (1U; top) or two nanodiscs (2U; bottom) and adopted a U-shaped conformation. (B) Upon insulin addition, all IRs in a single nanodisc adopted the T-shaped conformation (1T; middle), whereas IRs in two nanodiscs adopted either the U-shaped (top) or T-shaped conformation (2T; bottom). (C) In the presence of insulin, all IRs reconstituted into a single nanodisc. Most of them adopted a T-shaped conformation (top), whereas some showed an II-shaped conformation (II), likely representing a different view of IRs in the T-shaped conformation (bottom). The first three averages show a globular density that may represent dimerized tyrosine kinase domains (TKDs; arrows). (D) Upon insulin addition, all IRs showed a T-shaped conformation. The side length of individual panels is 47.7 nm. (E) Quantification of IR populations with a particular ectodomain (ECD) conformation at given insulin concentrations. (F) Cartoon illustrating the ligand (green) binding–induced conformational change in the ectodomain and its coupling to the transmembrane domains (TMDs) with concomitant activation of the tyrosine kinase domains by autophosphorylation (red asterisks). Our experimental data imply that binding of one ligand is sufficient to induce the transition of the IR ectodomain from the U-shaped to the T-shaped conformation. Insulin binding results in structural rearrangements of the receptor that allow the transmembrane domains to come togetherLigand binding by IRs displays negative cooperativity. The first ligand binds with high affinity and is suggested to suffice for receptor activation under physiological ligand concentrations (Lee and Pilch, 1994). At concentrations of ∼1–100 nM, a second insulin molecule can bind with lower affinity but accelerates dissociation of the first ligand. At ligand concentrations &gt;1 µM, three insulin molecules may occupy the receptor (De Meyts and Whittaker, 2002; Kiselyov et al., 2009).To understand the consequences of insulin binding, IRs were first incubated with a saturating insulin concentration of 1 µM before they were reconstituted into nanodiscs. EM images of this IR preparation showed that all receptors were incorporated into a single nanodisc (Fig. 3 C). All averages showed a dramatic conformational change in the ectodomains from the U-shaped conformation predominantly to a T-shaped conformation (∼72%; Fig. 3 C, top). A smaller fraction showed II-shaped ectodomains (26%), presumably representing a different view of the T-shaped conformation (Fig. 3 C, bottom). Additional exposure to 1 µM insulin after reconstitution showed that all dimeric IR ectodomains adopted the T-shaped conformation (Fig. 3 D). Importantly, because all ligand-bound IR dimers were incorporated into a single nanodisc, the two transmembrane domains must be in close proximity and presumably interact with each other.To confirm that the conformational change also occurs in membrane-embedded IRs, we used IRs reconstituted into nanodiscs in the absence of insulin (Fig. 3 A) and exposed them to 1 µM insulin. Averages still revealed IRs in the U-shaped conformation connecting two nanodiscs (Fig. 3 B, top), but these constituted a smaller fraction (∼53%). Strikingly, all IRs that were reconstituted into a single nanodisc appear to have undergone the conversion from the U-shaped to the T-shaped conformation upon insulin binding (Fig. 3 B, middle). The T-shaped receptors had a wingspan of ∼12.5–14.5 nm and extended ∼11–13.5 nm from the edge of the nanodiscs. In addition, averages now also showed T-shaped IRs extending from two nanodiscs (∼16%; Fig. 3 B, bottom). From these results, ligand binding to IRs reconstituted into two nanodiscs should convert their ectodomains into a T-shaped conformation, which, in turn, would exert a driving force to bring the transmembrane domains together. This force will tend to bring the two nanodiscs together, which was indeed seen in some of the averages (Fig. 3 B, bottom). Furthermore, nanodiscs connected by a T-shaped IR in general appeared to be closer to each other than those connected by a U-shaped IR (Fig. 3 B, compare top with bottom). The resulting juxtaposition of the two nanodiscs may only occasionally lead to fusion, allowing the transmembrane domains to interact, whereas in most cases, the two nanodiscs would likely remain separate, preventing the transmembrane domains from interacting.To test whether the transition into the T-shaped conformation also occurs at nonsaturating ligand conditions, we exposed IRs embedded in nanodiscs to an insulin concentration of 12 nM as well as to the physiologically relevant and highly substoichiometric insulin concentration of 0.8 nM. The quantification of the receptors in different conformations (Fig. 3 E and Table S3) implied that one ligand is sufficient to induce the conversion of the IR ectodomain from the U- to the T-shaped conformation.In the absence of insulin, the transmembrane domains are well separatedCrystallographic studies established that in unliganded IRs, the membrane-proximal segments of the ectodomains are ∼12 nm apart (McKern et al., 2006; Croll et al., 2016). We therefore hypothesized that reconstituting unliganded IRs into smaller nanodiscs should increase the number of IRs that incorporated into two nanodiscs. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the above experiments with MSP1D1, an MSP that forms smaller nanodiscs of ∼10 nm diameter (Denisov et al., 2004). As expected, in the absence of insulin, all receptors adopted the U-shaped conformation. More importantly, with the smaller nanodiscs, the two transmembrane domains of the dimeric IRs incorporated exclusively into separate nanodiscs, strengthening the notion that the transmembrane domains do not interact with each other in unliganded receptors (Fig. S4 A). In the presence of insulin, however, even with the smaller nanodiscs, all IRs reconstituted into single nanodiscs (Fig. S4 C). In summary, all results were consistent with those obtained with IRs reconstituted into the larger nanodiscs (Fig. S4).The T-shaped conformation of the activated IR described in this study resembles what has been seen in previous EM images of IRs in detergent and reconstituted into liposomes (Christiansen et al., 1991; Tranum-Jensen et al., 1994; Woldin et al., 1999). These studies, however, did not reveal conformational changes in the receptor upon exposure to insulin, whereas our data now provide direct structural evidence for a ligand-driven conformational change in the IR ectodomain and its importance for signal propagation across the membrane. In the absence of such data, mutually exclusive models have been proposed for IR activation (De Meyts and Whittaker, 2002; Ward et al., 2013; Kavran et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; De Meyts, 2015; Tatulian, 2015). In one model, IR transmembrane domains interact with each other in the inactive state, and insulin binding then pries them apart (Lee et al., 2014). In an opposing model proposed for the homologous insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, the ectodomains keep the transmembrane domains separated in the inactive state. Ligand binding would then release this inhibition and allow the transmembrane domains to interact (Kavran et al., 2014). An inhibitory role of the ectodomain has also been suggested for inactive preformed dimers of the EGF receptor in which the unliganded ectodomain exerts steric constraints to prevent the association of the N-terminal segments of the transmembrane helices (Zhu et al., 2003; Arkhipov et al., 2013). In line with this model, tryptic removal of the IR ectodomain was shown to result in constitutively active kinase domains (Shoelson et al., 1988). Our results unambiguously support the latter model also for IR regulation (Fig. 3 F): insulin binding induced a large conformational change in the IR ectodomain, releasing the constraint on the transmembrane domains and concomitantly facilitating autophosphorylation of the kinase domains. Indeed, some averages of the receptor in the T-shaped conformation showed a strong globular density (arrows in Fig. 3 C) that was not seen in averages of the receptor in the U-shaped conformation, suggesting that the tyrosine kinase domains in these averages may be more restricted in their localization and dimerized.Given the importance of the rearrangements in the IR transmembrane domains, we envision that the lipid environment will have an effect on receptor activation and regulation, a notion that can be tested further using the nanodisc system. Our results also provide novel structural insights that answer longstanding questions concerning the mechanism of how insulin activates the receptor, thus improving our understanding of the receptor and providing new perspectives for pharmacological intervention strategies.Materials and methodsExpression and purification of full-length IRscDNA for human IR isoform A was cloned into a pTT6 vector as described previously (Gerl et al., 2014), resulting in a construct consisting of the human IR isoform A followed by a C-terminal human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site and a tandem affinity purification tag.The receptor was produced in suspension-adapted FreeStyle HEK293F cells (RRID: CVCL_D603; Thermo Fisher Scientific) that were grown at 37°C in protein-free FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1× penicillin/streptavidin at 90 rpm and 8% CO2. Cells at 2 × 106 cells/ml in antibiotics-free medium were transiently transfected with 1 mg/liter endotoxin-free plasmid DNA (precomplexed with polythelenimine at a 1:8 [wt/wt] ratio; Gerl et al., 2014). The cells were maintained for 64 h at 31°C, 8% CO2, and 90 rpm. After harvesting the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min, the cell pellet from 1 liter of cell culture was resuspended in 100 ml ice-cold detergent-free HBS (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl, supplemented with 8 mM Pefabloc, 10 µM E64, and two tablets of complete protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Resuspended cells were disrupted using a tip sonicator (Ultrasonic Homogenizer Sonopuls HD 3100 with an SH70 G horn and MS 73 microtip [3 mm]; Bandelin Electronic) in the absence of detergent by four to six sonication cycles (1 s pulse and 1 s pause for 30 s total followed by 1 min pause at 17% amplitude). Protein purification was performed at 4°C as described previously for EGF receptor (Coskun et al., 2011), except that the pH of all purification buffers was 7.5 and that after the washing step with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol-containing running buffer, the column was equilibrated with HBS supplemented with 1% (wt/vol) CHAPS and 8% (vol/vol) glycerol for overnight incubation with human rhinovirus 3C protease and protein elution.IR concentration was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient of 377,585 M−1 cm−1 as calculated by ProtParam (ExPASy), assuming 42 of the total 94 cysteines are forming disulfide bonds in the dimeric receptor (Croll et al., 2016). The typical yield of purified IR was ∼0.5 mg from 1 liter of cell culture.For quality controls, analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superose 6 3.2/300 column (GE Healthcare) with IR elution buffer at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min at room temperature followed by SDS-PAGE of the collected fractions and silver staining. Purified IR was immediately reconstituted into nanodiscs.Purification of MSP1E3D1 and MSP1D1Plasmids encoding MSP pMSP1E3D1 (20066) and pMSP1D1 (20061) were purchased from Addgene. Both MSP variants were produced in E. coli BL21Gold(DE) (Agilent Technologies) and purified as described previously (Inagaki et al., 2012) with the exceptions that prepacked His-Trap HP columns (GE Healthcare) were used for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and that an additional wash step with cholate was introduced (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, and 32 mM cholate). The His tag was not removed.Reconstitution of IRs into nanodiscs1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), N-stearoyl-d-erythro-sphingosyl-phosphorylcholine (SM), and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. All lipid stocks were quantified on a regular basis to correct for solvent evaporation by a phosphate assay for phospholipids (Rouser et al., 1966) or an Amplex red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen) and were controlled for their stability by thin-layer chromatography. DOPC, SM, and cholesterol were mixed at a ratio of 80:15:5 mol%, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and left under vacuum overnight to remove residual solvent. To better solubilize the lipid mixture containing cholesterol and sphingomyelin and to improve reproducibility, the dried film was first used to form liposomes by addition of reconstitution buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl) with vigorous shaking at 54°C followed by 10 freeze-thaw cycles and 21 extrusions through a 100-nm pore-size polycarbonate filter. The resulting unilamellar liposomes were then solubilized by addition of cholate (Alfa Aesar) to a final concentration of 18 mM and subsequent sonication in a water bath.IRs were reconstituted into nanodiscs in the presence or absence of human insulin (I2643; Sigma-Aldrich). For reconstitutions in the presence of insulin, 0.3 µM IR in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (wt/vol) CHAPS, and 8% (vol/vol) glycerol was incubated with 1 µM insulin for 1 h on ice. Before usage, insulin was dissolved to a concentration of 180 µM in 5 mM HCl. Insulin was added to the IR reconstitution mix to a final concentration of 1 µM. Even though the pH of the solution did not change, the same amount of 5 mM HCl was added to the unliganded receptor to rule out potential effects of HCl on IR. For nanodisc formation, 0.3 nmol liganded or unliganded IR was incubated with 200 nmol cholate-solubilized lipids and 10 nmol MSP1E3D1 or MSP1D1 for 30 min in the presence of 13.2 mM CHAPS at 25°C with gentle shaking at 300 rpm. The reconstitution mix was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was extensively dialyzed against at least a 1,000× excess of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl for 26 h at 4°C with three buffer exchanges followed by a fourth exchange to 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl for 18 h. Dialysis was performed in Spectra/Por 7 standard regenerated cellulose pretreated dialysis tubings (Spectrum Labs) with a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kD (for the first 18 h) and 50 kD (until the end of the dialysis). Because of the aggregation propensity of nonreconstituted MSPs, aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 g for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. IR-containing nanodiscs were separated from empty nanodiscs by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl, and only the peak fraction was collected.For EM experiments of IR reconstituted into nanodiscs with MSP1E3D1, the peak fraction was split into four aliquots. One aliquot was imaged directly by negative-stain EM, and the other aliquots were incubated with varying amounts of insulin (final concentrations of 0.8 nM, 12 nM, or 1 µM) for 1 h at 4°C before imaging. For IR reconstituted into nanodiscs with MSP1D1, the peak fraction was split into halves. One half was imaged directly by negative-stain EM, whereas the other half was incubated with 1 µM insulin (final concentration) for 1 h at 4°C before imaging.The concentration of IR in nanodiscs was estimated by UV spectroscopy at 280 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 438,030 M−1 cm−1 for samples reconstituted with MSP1E3D1 and 420,445 M−1 cm−1 for samples reconstituted with MSP1D1 as calculated with ProtParam (ExPASy) assuming that 42 of the 94 cysteines formed disulfide bonds.In vitro phosphorylation assayA saturating insulin concentration (200 nM) was added to purified CHAPS-solubilized IRs or nanodisc-embedded IRs and allowed to bind for 1 h on ice. Phosphorylation was performed with 0.25 mM ATP in 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM MnCl2 in a final volume of 25 µl and incubated for 12 min at 25°C. For solubilized IRs, the CHAPS concentration was kept at the critical micellar concentration of 0.6% (wt/vol). The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM EDTA. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and IR tyrosine kinase domain phosphorylation was assessed by Western blotting.SDS-PAGE and Western blotsElectrophoresis was performed with precast 4–12% Bis-Tris gels with MOPS SDS running buffer or 3–8% Tris-acetate gels or NativePAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) using the corresponding commercial running buffers (Invitrogen). Proteins were stained with Coomassie blue or silver stain or were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunodetection. Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk powder in TBST (0.1% [vol/vol] Tween-20 in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 µM NaVO4 and 20 µM β-glycerophosphate). Membranes were probed with antibodies against phospho-IRβ (Tyr-1150/1151; 1:1,000; 3024; RRID, AB_331253; Cell Signaling Technology) or against total IRβ C terminus (1:2,000; 3020; RRID, AB_2249166; Cell Signaling Technology). The secondary antibodies goat anti–rabbit IgG (H+L; 170-6515; RRID, AB_11125142; Bio-Rad Laboratories) or goat anti–mouse IgG (H+L; 170-6516; RRID, AB_11125547; Bio-Rad Laboratories) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used at a 1:10,000 dilution, and detection was performed using SuperSignal West Femto maximum-sensitivity substrate electrochemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a charge-coupled device imager (Imager 600; GE Healthcare).Specimen preparation and EMAn aliquot (3.5 µl) of full-length IR reconstituted into nanodiscs was adsorbed to a glow-discharged 200-mesh copper grid covered with a thin carbon-coated plastic film. After adsorbing the sample for 1 min, the grid was blotted with a filter paper and washed twice with buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl), once with deionized water, and once with a 0.75% (wt/vol) uranyl formate solution, blotting the grid with filter paper between each drop, and then it was stained for 30 s with the uranyl formate solution. After blotting the grid again with filter paper, the remaining solution was removed by vacuum aspiration (see Ohi et al. [2004] for further details). Images were collected using an XR16L-ActiveVu charge-coupled device camera (AMT) on a Philips CM10 electron microscope (FEI) operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The calibrated magnification was 41,513× (nominal magnification of 52,000×), yielding a pixel size of 2.65 Å at the specimen level. The defocus was set to –1.5 µm.Image processingImages of nanodisc-embedded IRs showed a very heterogeneous particle population. Therefore, for further image processing, particle selection focused on particles that showed one nanodisc with an additional density extending from them or two nanodiscs connected by a density. For each sample, ∼10,000 particles (the exact numbers of images and selected particles are summarized in Table S1) were manually selected using the e2boxer.py command of the EMAN2 software package (Tang et al., 2007) and windowed into 180 × 180–pixel images. After image normalization and particle centering, the particle images were classified into 200 groups using K-means classification procedures implemented in SPIDER (Frank et al., 1996). For the ISAC algorithm (Yang et al., 2012) implemented in SPARX software (Hohn et al., 2007), the particle images were reduced to 76 × 76 pixels and subjected to several ISAC generations specifying 50 images per group and a pixel error threshold of 0.7 (the number of ISAC generations and resulting number of averages for each sample are summarized in Table S1).To estimate the approximate number of receptors adopting a particular conformation, we used the K-means classification into 200 groups and visually assigned the averages to show (a) a U-shaped IR reconstituted into one nanodisc (1U), (b) a U-shaped IR reconstituted into two nanodiscs (2U), (c) a T-shaped IR reconstituted into one nanodisc (1T), (d) a T-shaped IR reconstituted into two nanodiscs (2T), (e) a II-shaped IR (II; we only observed IRs in this conformation associated with one nanodisc), and (f) an L-shaped IR (L; we only observed L-shaped IRs associated with one nanodisc, consistent with the assumption that these particles represent IR monomers). For each set of averages, the particles in the classes assigned to one of these six classes were summed up and are listed in Table S2. Many of the averages could not be unambiguously assigned to one of the six classes. These classes (X) were considered uninterpretable and were excluded from the quantification. The assignments of the classes for each experimental condition are denoted in Fig. S3 C and dataviewer content showing the 200 SPIDER class averages. In addition, the particles showing the L-shaped nonphysiological monomeric IR were not considered when calculating the percentage of dimeric receptors in each conformation (1U, 2U, 1T, 2T, or II) as listed in Table S3.Online supplemental materialFig. S1 illustrates the biochemical analyses of purified IR and IR reconstitution into nanodiscs. Fig. S2 shows autophosphorylation assays for IRs in detergent and in nanodiscs. Fig. S3 presents EM analysis of IR reconstituted into large nanodiscs with MSP1E3D1 in the absence of insulin, showing an EM image and the class averages obtained by ISAC and K-means classification. Fig. S4 shows the conformation of IR reconstituted into small nanodiscs with MSP1D1 under different insulin exposure conditions. Table S1 provides statistics for EM image collection and ISAC classification. Table S2 provides the numbers of particles assigned to specific IR conformations, and Table S3 provides the corresponding percentages of the dimer population.

Diabetes Management and Insulin Pumps - Online Continuing Education,"Diabetes Management and Insulin Pumps Contact Hours: 2.5 Cost: $25.00 Since the introduction of insulin pumps several decades ago, Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) therapy has become the preferred method of treatment for everyone with Type 1 Diabetes. For patients using CSII, it replaces multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin. Insulin pumps are also used for some people with Type 2 Diabetes who, as a result of the progression of their diabetes, require MDI of insulin a day, similar to a person who has Type 1 Diabetes. Many of the patients admitted to long term care facilities, assisted living facilities, post acute care facilities and rehabilitation units are mentally alert but need of physical care during an extended recovery or rehabilitation time. The dilemma in the post acute care settings, when a patient is admitted who has been on CSII, is whether to continue the use of the insulin pump or revert back to MDI of insulin. In this course, we will explore when it is appropriate to leave the patient on CSII, when to consider reverting to multiple injections and how to manage an insulin pump in the post acute care setting when it is determined to be the preferred method of treatment. Videos, pictures and links to pertinent web sites are included to enhance the learning experience. ObjectivesUpon completion of this course, the participant will be able to:1. Discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of continuing CSII in a post-acute care facility.2. Identify the most important resource needed to continue CSII in a post-acute care facility.3. Name the urgent interventions required to problem solve hyper and hypoglycemia for a patient on CSII.4. Specify the type of insulin most commonly used in CSII.CurriculumChapter 1 Introduction to CSII• Types of Diabetes• History of Insulin Pumps• Advantages of CSII• Disadvantages of CSIIChapter 2 Insulin Used in CSII• Types of Insulin• CSII TerminologyChapter 3 Insulin Pump Companies and Equipment• Pumps Currently on the Market in U.S.• Web Sites for Insulin Pump Companies• Insulin Pump EquipmentChapter 4 Mechanics of Operating Insulin PumpsAnimas One Touch PingMedtronicDiabetes ParadigmOmnipod t:slim Chapter 5 Acute Illness and/or Unexplained Hyperglycemia• General Rules for Sick Day Management• Timing of Boluses During Illness• Unexplained hyperglycemiaChapter 6 Hypoglycemia• Assessment• TreatmentChapter 7 Routine Assessment and Documentation• Assessment• Documentation Chapter 8 Resources• Patient• Family• Facility Dietitian• Local or Area Diabetes Center• Endocrinologist/Diabetologist• Pump Company Websites• Pump Company Representatives",https://t.co/LzqWL76Jil,papers
Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells,"IntroductionEditorial, see p 1951Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is characterized by valvular calcification, followed by aortic stenosis and subsequent heart failure.1,2 CAVD progression is accompanied by highly regulated biological changes, including fibrous thickening and osteogenic changes in the aortic valve,3–6 wherein inflammation is the initiating event.3,4,7 Although CAVD shares similar pathological features with atherosclerosis in terms of lipid deposition and inflammation,7 previous trials with cholesterol-lowering statin therapy failed to prevent CAVD progression.8,9 Recent investigations identified reciprocal interactions between valvular endothelial cells (VECs) and valvular interstitial cells (VICs), which are critical for osteogenic changes in aortic valve tissues.1,4,10,11 However, the molecular mechanisms or targets for nonsurgical treatments, to prevent or slow the progression of CAVD, remain elusive.12Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26)—a multifunctional enzyme—is found in the catalytically active soluble form in plasma and on the surface of most cell types.13,14 DPP-4 cleaves the N-terminal dipeptides (ie, proline or alanine residues) from its substrates. Because most DPP-4 substrates are incretin hormones, DPP-4 has become a major target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, the prescription of DPP-4-inhibitors, a new class of oral hypoglycemics, has markedly increased over the past few years.15,16 Nevertheless, DPP-4 has a wide range of biological functions and can bind with numerous peptides that serve as potential substrates for DPP-4. The nonglycemic actions of DPP-4 and its inhibitor, particularly in cardiovascular disease involving the myocardium or heart valves, have not been fully characterized, and further studies are required.In the present study, we assessed whether DPP-4 can serve as a molecular therapeutic target for aortic valve calcification. DPP-4 increases valvular calcification and promotes CAVD progression by limiting autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling by the enzymatic degradation of IGF-1 in human VICs and inducing the subsequent osteogenic transdifferentiation of these cells to calcifying cells. In particular, we aimed to demonstrate that the DPP-4–IGF-1 axis is an important mechanism to explain the reciprocal interactions between VECs and VICs, which play a critical role in valve homeostasis, and that this axis can be an effective therapeutic target for the prevention of CAVD progression.MethodsHuman SubjectsHuman aortic valve tissues were obtained from patients with CAVD who underwent aortic valve replacement (n=10) and from extracted recipient hearts for use as non-CAVD controls (n=8) (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Half of each sample specimen was used to prepare VECs and VICs or was immediately stored in RNAlater (Life Technologies), whereas the other half was fixed in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek). The Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) approved the study protocol for the collection of human samples (reference no. 2013-0442), and all patients provided written informed consent.Animal ExperimentsMiceAll animal experiments were performed according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Committee for the Use and Care of Laboratory animals. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient (eNOS−/−) mice with a C57BL/6 background were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Wild-type (WT) and eNOS−/− mice (8 weeks of age) were randomly assigned and administered saline or Sitagliptin (15 mg/kg/d, Selleckchem) orally for 12 weeks. Mice were maintained on a 12-hour light−dark cycle. Under anesthesia, the mice were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Mice were euthanized, and blood and aortic valve samples were collected for analysis. The hearts were dissected, fixed overnight, and paraffin embedded. Serial sections (5 μm) were cut from the entire aortic valve area.RabbitsTwenty-nine male New Zealand white rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) were used in this study. They were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the diet and were followed for 12 weeks: (1) rabbits fed normal chow (control group, n=5), (2) rabbits fed 0.5% cholesterol-enriched chow (Dytes Inc.) plus 25 000 IU/day vitamin D2 (Vit.D2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in drinking water (Chol+Vit.D2 group, n=9), and (3) rabbits fed high-cholesterol diet+vitamin D supplements and also administered Sitagliptin orally for 12 weeks (Sitagliptin group, n=15). Rabbits in the Sitagliptin group were again randomized according to the Sitagliptin dose: 4, 8, or 15 mg/kg/day. Blood samples were obtained by the marginal vein of the rabbit ear at baseline and every 3 weeks thereafter. After 12 weeks, the rabbits were euthanized, and blood and aortic valve tissue samples were collected for analysis.Statistical AnalysisAll quantitative experiments were performed in triplicate (at a minimum). Data are presented as means±standard deviation. The Osteosense imaging and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed by individuals blinded to the allocation during outcome assessment. In vitro data were normally distributed, with similar variances among the groups. Because of the small number of animals in each group and because some of the distributions were not normal in the animal study, a nonparametric analysis of variance was used to compare continuous variables among the groups. A 2-tailed Student's t test or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Wilcoxon's signed rank tests were used to assess statistical significance. Bonferroni correction was performed to adjust for the multiple comparisons. A value of P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.The Supplemental Methods section in the online-only Data Supplement provides a detailed description of the global gene expression analysis; cell culture; osteogenic differentiation; alkaline phosphatase, alizarin red, and Von Kossa staining; calcium assay; reporter assays; alkaline phosphatase activity assays; fluorescence reflectance imaging in vivo; immunohistochemistry; immunofluorescence staining; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; immunoblot assay; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; determination of DPP-4 activity; and echocardiography.ResultsDPP-4 Expression Is Upregulated in the Aortic Valves of Patients With CAVDTo determine the key factors for CAVD, we investigated the global gene expression profiles involved in human CAVD using Affymetrix Gene Chip microarrays. The genes associated with calcification, fibrosis, and inflammation were upregulated in the aortic valve tissue of patients with CAVD, compared with those of age-matched non-CAVD controls (Figure 1A). In particular, DPP-4 was significantly upregulated in patients with CAVD (Figure 1A and 1B). High DPP-4 protein expression was observed in the regions of the CAVD aortic valves with prominent calcified lesion formation, as demonstrated by alizarin red and Von Kossa staining, and was localized in VICs, as indicated by the coexpression of DPP-4 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of activated myofibroblast-like VICs (Figure 1C, 1D, 1E, and 1F). In contrast, the DPP-4 expression in non-CAVD human aortic valve tissue was negligible (Figure 1F).Figure 1. Upregulation of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) expression in human aortic valve tissue from a patient with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD).A, Gene expression profiles of calcification, fibrosis, and inflammation in aortic valve tissue. Up- and downregulated transcripts are shown in red and green, respectively. The columns correspond to aortic valve samples without (non-CAVD #1–3) and with (CAVD #1–3) CAVD. The heat map is scaled at the row level to compare expression profiles between samples for a given probe set. B, mRNA level of human DPP-4 (hDPP-4) was validated by performing quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in aortic valves from non-CAVD (n=8) and CAVD (n=10) samples. The expression values of the samples are shown relative to that of the GAPDH reference gene. Values represent fold changes of the mean value measured in the non-CAVD controls. C, Aortic valves from patients with CAVD and non-CAVD controls were stained with alizarin red (AR), Von Kossa (VK), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), hDPP-4, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining. Merged images (DAPI, hDPP-4, and α-SMA) are shown. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 100 μm. D, The bar graph presents the AR-positive area and (E) VK-positive area measured in each aortic valve from non-CAVD (n=8) and CAVD samples (n=10). F, The DPP-4 expression level in the aortic valve is represented as a percentage of immunoreactive cells in the aortic valves of non-CAVD (n=8) and CAVD samples (n=10).

Only the human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs) expressing α-actin 2 and cardiac beta myosin heavy chain 7 in patients with CAVD exhibited a marked elevation of the osteogenic marker, alkaline phosphatase mRNA (Figure 2A), which coincided with an increase in both DPP-4 mRNA expression (Figure 2A) and DPP-4 protein level (Figure 2B). In contrast, human VECs expressing platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule showed minimal differences in the DPP-4 mRNA levels between patients with CAVD and non-CAVD controls (Figure 2A). The human VECs from CAVD aortic valves expressed lower levels of eNOS mRNA (Figure 2A) and protein (Figure I in the online-online Data Supplement), compared with those in the controls. These results suggest that prominent dysfunction in VECs and osteogenic changes in VICs are characteristic features of patients with CAVD.Figure 2.

A, Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of PECAM1 (platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1), ACTA2 (α-SMA) (alpha-actin 2), MYH7 (myosin heavy chain 7), ALP (alkaline phosphatase), human DPP-4 (hDPP-4), and human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (heNOS) from human valvular endothelial cells (hVECs) and human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs) in non-CAVD controls (n=8) and patients with CAVD (n=10). Values represent fold changes of the mean value measured in the non-CAVD hVEC group. B, The levels of hDPP-4 protein in conditioned media (CM) were measured in hVECs and hVICs of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. C, hDPP-4 mRNA levels in hVICs treated with Diethylenetriamine-NONOate (DETA-NO) as determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Values represent the fold changes of the mean value measured in the vehicle. D, Immunoblot analysis of hDPP-4 and β-actin from hVICs treated with DETA-NO for 48 h. Quantification of the hDPP-4 density relative to β-actin. Values represent fold changes of the mean value measured for vehicle treatment. E, hDPP-4 protein levels in CM from non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD. hVICs treated with DETA-NO were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using Student's t tests.Given that the administration of Nω-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, enhances DPP-4 expression in the aorta,18 we reasoned that NO depletion would trigger DPP-4 expression. NO supplemented with DETA-NONOate (DETA-NO) decreased DPP-4 mRNA expression (Figure 2C) and DPP-4 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in hVICs (Figure 2D). Moreover, DPP-4 protein secretion was higher in hVICs from patients with CAVD than in hVICs from non-CAVD controls and was suppressed by DETA-NO supplementation (Figure 2E).DPP-4 Expression Is Directly Regulated by NF-κB Activity, and DPP-4 Activation Results in the Osteogenic Differentiation of Aortic VICsNF-κB activity is known to be suppressed by NO, which is derived from endothelial cells.19 Because the DPP4 promoter contains a putative NF-κB binding site, we tested whether NF-κB activity directly regulates DPP-4 promoter activity. The elevation of DPP-4 promoter activity was reduced by DETA-NO supplementation in hVICs as well as HEK293 cells (Figure 3A and Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). However, mutating the NF-κB binding site in the DPP-4 promoter led to a significant inhibition of DPP-4 promoter activity, even in the absence of DETA-NO (Figure 3A). These results demonstrate that NO depletion leads to the induction of DPP-4 expression by the activation of NF-κB, suggesting a regulatory link between VECs and VICs. To obtain more direct evidence of the regulation of DPP-4 expression by NF-κB, we examined the effect of the NF-κB inhibitor on DPP-4 protein expression in hVICs. We found that the NF-κB inhibitor significantly reduced DPP-4 expression in hVICs in patients with CAVD (Figure 3B).Figure 3. DPP-4 upregulation by nitric oxide deprivation-dependent NF-κB activation results in osteogenic transdifferentiation of aortic valve interstitial cells. A, Schematic of the putative NF-κB binding site in the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) promoter. The underlined letters indicate mutations (MT) in the NF-κB binding site. Human DPP-4 (hDPP-4) promoter activity was measured in valvular interstitial cells (VICs) after transfection with either the luciferase constructs of the wild-type (WT) or MT hDPP-4 promoters followed by treatment with Diethylenetriamine-NONOate (DETA-NO). B, hDPP-4 levels in conditioned media from non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD.

C, Alizarin red (AR) staining of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD hVICs in the presence or absence of Sitagliptin (100 μM) after 4 weeks of osteogenic stimulation. The bar graph presents the AR-positive area measured in each culture dish. D, The calcium concentration in the cells from (C) was measured as described in the Supplemental Methods section in the online-only Data Supplement. E, Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of ALP (alkaline phosphatase), RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2), Sp7 (Sp7 Transcription Factor), and BGLAP (bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein) mRNA from hVICs of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD after treatment with Sitagliptin. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using Student's t tests.The high levels of DPP-4 expression in hVICs from the aortic valves of CAVD cases suggest that DPP-4 plays a role in osteogenic transition, particularly in the phenotypic change from VICs to calcifying cells.20 Thus, we examined the effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor in hVICs from patients with CAVD and age-matched non-CAVD controls. Sitagliptin is a highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of human type 2 diabetes mellitus.21 Sitagliptin treatment significantly attenuated the osteogenic changes in hVICs from patients with CAVD in vitro (Figure 3C and 3D), which coincided with a decrease in the mRNA expression of osteogenic markers, including alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, Sp7 transcription factor (also known as osterix), and bone γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (also known as osteocalcin) (Figure 3E). Moreover, we confirmed the attenuation of in vitro calcification in DPP-4 knockout mouse VICs (mVICs). When compared with WT mVICs, the alkaline phosphatase staining and activity were significantly diminished in DPP-4 knockout mVICs, even after osteogenic stimulation (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).DPP-4 Induces the Osteogenic Transition of Aortic Valvular Interstitial Cells by Inactivating IGF-1-Mediated SignalingWe believe that the peptidase activity of DPP-422,23 might promote osteogenic changes in VICs. The addition of DPP-4 and its substrate, IGF-1, to hVICs induced osteogenic differentiation; however, none of the other DPP-4 substrates affected VIC calcification (Figure 4A). IGF-1 is known to inhibit osteogenic changes in vascular smooth muscle cells by binding to the IGF-1 receptor by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.24–26 The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and Akt on IGF-1 stimulation in hVICs was suppressed by DPP-4 (Figure 4B). A truncated form of IGF-1, resulting from DPP-4-mediated proteolytic cleavage, displays reduced binding to IGF-1 receptor23 and fails to activate the autocrine system for IGF-1 production.27 Moreover, we found that IGF-1 production was inhibited by DPP-4 but recovered after Sitagliptin treatment (Figure 4C and 4D). DPP-4 treatment increased the osteogenic potential of hVICs in the presence of IGF-1, and this effect was abrogated by Sitagliptin treatment (Figure 4E and 4F).Figure 4. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inactivates insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-mediated signaling to induce osteogenesis in human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs) in vitro.

Values represent the percentage of AR-positive areas compared with the control. F, The calcium concentration in the cells from (E) was determined. G, Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of IGF-1 from hVECs and hVICs of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD. Values represent the fold changes of the mean value measured in the non-CAVD hVEC. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using Student's t tests. H, Immunofluorescence staining of IGF-1 in the aortic valves of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Merged images (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI] and IGF-1) are shown. Scale bar, 100 μm.The IGF-1 mRNA levels in hVICs from patients with CAVD were ≈2.5-fold lower than those from non-CAVD controls (Figure 4G). These findings suggest that DPP-4 limits autocrine IGF-1 signaling by the enzymatic degradation of IGF-1, thus leading to VIC calcification. Therefore, we hypothesized that IGF-1 levels could be associated with CAVD progression and analyzed the tissue levels of IGF-1 in patients with CAVD. The expression of IGF-1 protein in the aortic valve (Figure 4H) was lower than those in non-CAVD controls, indicating a negative association between IGF-1 levels and CAVD.Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 Inhibitor, Reduced Calcified Lesion Formation in eNOS−/− Mice by Restoring IGF-1 SignalingeNOS−/− mice are used as an animal model of aortic valve calcification.3,28 DPP-4 was found to be upregulated in the calcified regions of the aortic valve leaflets of eNOS−/− mice, as demonstrated by Von Kossa-positive staining (Figure 5A). The DPP-4 mRNA expression in the aortic valve (Figure 5B) and circulating DPP-4 protein levels (Figure 5C) were higher in eNOS−/− mice than in WT mice. Thereafter, we evaluated the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors for treating aortic valve calcification in eNOS−/− mice. Fluorescence reflectance imaging, with a bisphosphonate-conjugated molecular imaging agent, showed that eNOS−/− mice had much higher levels of calcification of the aortic root and valve than WT mice (Figure 5D, 5E, and 5F). The oral administration of Sitagliptin decreased in vivo calcification (Figure 5D) as well as Von Kossa-stained regions and calcium deposition in the aortic valves of eNOS−/− mice, compared with those receiving vehicle treatment (Figure 5E and 5F).Figure 5.

C, Comparison of the plasma levels of mDPP-4 in WT and eNOS−/− mice as determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (n=7 per group).

Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using Student's t tests.Moreover, Sitagliptin treatment significantly inhibited osteogenic changes in eNOS−/− mVICs in vitro (Figure 6A and 6B) and decreased the mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, Sp7, and bone γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (Figure 6C), similar to that noted in hVICs. IGF-1 treatment attenuated the osteogenic changes in eNOS−/− mVICs, which was diminished by DPP-4 treatment (Figure 6D and 6E). Sitagliptin treatment significantly inhibited DPP-4-mediated osteogenic differentiation (Figure 6D and 6E). Moreover, the plasma IGF-1 levels in eNOS−/− mice were ≈3-fold lower than those in WT mice but increased after Sitagliptin treatment (Figure 6F).Figure 6.

Values represent the percentage of AR-positive areas compared with the control. E, The calcium content in the cells from (D) was measured. F, The levels of mIGF-1 in plasma were measured in WT and eNOS−/− mice treated with vehicle or Sitagliptin (n=7 per group). Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using Student's t tests.Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis Can Be Prevented by DPP-4 Inhibition With Sitagliptin in a Rabbit Model of CAVDWe induced aortic valve stenosis and significant calcium deposition through a combination diet with high-cholesterol and vitamin D (vit.D2) supplements in rabbits as described previously.29,30 The rabbits were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the diet and were followed for 12 weeks: (1) the control group (fed a normal diet), (2) the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, and (3) the Sitagliptin group (treated with 15 mg/kg/day of Sitagliptin, with a cholesterol-vit.D2 diet). Table II in the online-online Data Supplement summarizes the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics over the study period in all 3 groups. There was no significant difference in animal weight among the 3 groups at the time of sacrifice. The baseline echocardiographic measurements were also comparable in all 3 groups (Table II in the online-online Data Supplement).Although aortic valve cusps were thickened and became hyperechogenic after 12 weeks in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, the administration of Sitagliptin markedly reversed cusp morphology similar to that observed in the control group (Figure 7A). Moreover, the aortic valve area, measured using the standard continuity equation, remained unchanged in the Sitagliptin group but significantly decreased in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group (Figure 7B). Continuous-wave Doppler assessment of aortic valve function indicated that the cholesterol-vit.D2 group had much higher levels of transaortic maximal velocity at 12 weeks (Figure 7C and 7D). The mean transaortic pressure gradients were also significantly increased in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group (Figure 7E). However, when Sitagliptin was orally administered, no change in the Doppler parameters was noted (Figure 7C, 7D, and 7E), indicating the therapeutic effect of DPP-4 inhibition by the attenuation of cholesterol-vit.D2 diet-induced aortic valve stenosis in a rabbit model. These results support our hypothesis that the inhibition of DPP-4 can resolve aortic valve calcification and significant aortic stenosis in vivo.Figure 7. Effect of Sitagliptin on the aortic valve in a rabbit model with calcific aortic valve disease as determined by echocardiographic assessment. A, Representative 2-dimensional echocardiographic images of the aortic valve cusp at 12 weeks after treatment initiation. The aortic valves were imaged in the parasternal short axis (Upper) and long axis (Lower) views to assess valve morphology. In the control group fed a normal diet, the aortic valve shows a barely visible thin structure. However, in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet and vitamin D2 supplements (Chol+Vit.D2), the aortic cusps had become thickened and hyperechogenic (arrows). Treatment with Sitagliptin (Chol+Vit.D2 +Sitagliptin) could reverse the valve morphology to a similar state as in the control group. B, The aortic valve area (AVA) was measured using the standard continuity equation. C, Continuous-wave Doppler was used to measure the integral of the transvalvular flow to be utilized in the continuity equation for AVA calculation and to record the transaortic (D) peak velocity (Vmax) and (E) mean pressure gradients. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using nonparametric matched data analysis and a Wilcoxon's signed rank test.The therapeutic effects were observed in a dose-dependent manner and were generally greater for rabbits receiving a higher dose (8 or 15 mg/kg) of Sitagliptin than for rabbits receiving a relatively lower dose (4 mg/kg) (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement). Despite treatment with high-dose Sitagliptin, the rabbits did not show any evidence of hypoglycemia (Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement). Although the blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, compared with the control group, the levels were decreased in the Sitagliptin group and remained within the normal range for rabbits at 3 weeks (Figure VA in the online-only Data Supplement) and at 12 weeks (Figure VB in the online-only Data Supplement).Hematoxylin-eosin staining demonstrated the marked thickening of the aortic valve cusps, related to increased cellularity (Masson trichrome stain), in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, compared with the control group (Figure VI in the online-only Data Supplement, Figure 8A and 8B). In contrast, the cusps from the Sitagliptin group were relatively thin, and calcium deposits (alizarin red stain) were localized to a much lesser extent than in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group (Figure VI in the online-only Data Supplement, Figure 8A and 8B). A greater number of macrophages infiltrated the aortic side of the cusp in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, whereas only a few macrophages were detected in the aortic cusps of rabbits treated with Sitagliptin (Figure VI in the online-only Data Supplement, Figure 8A and 8B). The plasma DPP-4 activity in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group showed a marked elevation, compared with that in the control group at 6 and 12 weeks (Figure 8C, Figures VIIA and VIII in the online-only Data Supplement), which was associated with lower plasma IGF-1 level (Figure 8D, Figure VIIB in the online-only Data Supplement). However, the rabbits treated with Sitagliptin displayed high plasma IGF-1 levels (Figure 8D, Figure VIIB in the online-only Data Supplement) and significantly suppressed DPP-4 activities over a 12-week period (Figure 8C, Figures VIIA and VIII in the online-only Data Supplement). This result supports our hypothesis that low plasma IGF-1 levels are associated with CAVD progression, and that Sitagliptin treatment significantly increased plasma IGF-1 levels, which subsequently diminished the osteogenic changes in the aortic valve leaflets and prevented CAVD progression in vivo.Figure 8.

A low-magnification view of these images was provided in Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement. B, Longitudinal section of rabbit aortic cusps attached to the aortic root. An asterisk indicates the aortic side of the cusp. Scale bar, 200 μm. Hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining demonstrates marked thickening on the aortic side of the cusp in the high-cholesterol diet and vitamin D2 supplements (Chol+Vit.D2) group. This thickening is associated with an increase in cellularity (Masson trichrome stain [MT]), macrophage infiltration (RAM-11 immunostain), and calcification (alizarin red [AR] stain). C, Plasma DPP-4 activity and (D) IGF-1 levels were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, or 12 weeks. Each group comprised ≥5 animals. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. ND indicates normal diet.DiscussionIn the present study, we observed a novel mechanism wherein endothelial cell dysfunction, resulting in significantly low NO levels, increased the DPP-4 expression by NF-kB signaling and promoter binding in aortic VICs. Furthermore, we found that IGF-1 is a potential substrate for DPP-4 that mediates calcification and showed that treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor is protective against the progression of aortic valve calcification in animal models. Thus, these findings reveal potential new mechanisms of aortic valve calcification, which suggest DPP-4 and IGF-1 as mediators of osteogenic transformation in VICs.Recently, the nonglycemic effect of DPP-4 has been reported to be beneficial in a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 protects against myocardial infarction,31 ischemia/reperfusion injury,32 and cardiac hypertrophy33 in animal models. DPP-4 inhibitors have also been found to improve endothelial dysfunction34 and attenuate inflammation and subsequent plaque development in the vascular systems of human patients,35 thus leading to therapeutic benefits in cardiovascular disease. However, the issue of the potential association with heart failure is unclear. In a recent, large randomized study,36 no difference was observed in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. Moreover, a retrospective, large cohort study37 also found no evidence of an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure with DPP-4 inhibitors among patients with and without cardiovascular disease history at baseline. These reports support previous observations of the potential beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibition on heart failure.38,39 To our knowledge, this is the first report on the nonglycemic function of DPP-4 as part of the mechanism of valvular heart disease, particularly in aortic valve calcification. We suggest that the main mechanisms of CAVD development and progression are the DPP-4 overexpression, which is triggered by endothelial dysfunction, and the increased enzymatic activity, which leads to the suppression of IGF-1 activity.IGF-1 is an anabolic growth hormone with pleiotropic actions on the cardiovascular system.40 IGF-1 signaling regulates contractility, metabolism, hypertrophy, autophagy, senescence, and apoptosis in the heart. IGF-1 deficiency is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas the cardiac activation of the IGF-1 receptor protects against the detrimental effects of a high-fat diet and myocardial infarction.41 Moreover, IGF-1 was found to protect against endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic plaque development, and metabolic syndrome, thus indicating that IGF-1 can serve as a vascular protective factor.42 The protective effect of IGF-1 on the proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells has already been reported.43,44 Along with the coincidental vascular calcification with bone loss or osteoporosis, regulatory mechanisms of IGF-1 on vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic transformation to osteogenic-like cells were considered to have a potential clinical implication for osteoporosis therapy.44 However, its potential implication for the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of VICs has yet to be reported. In the present study, we sought to identify the other important roles of IGF-1 signaling in the onset and progression of CAVD. In particular, we determined the critical role of IGF-1 signaling in the downstream mechanism after DPP-4 activation in CAVD through mechanistic studies on cultured hVICs. The addition of DPP-4 and IGF-1, as its substrate, to hVICs induced osteogenic differentiation. However, none of the other DPP-4 substrates affected VIC calcification. We found that IGF-1 production was inhibited by DPP-4, which recovered after the administration of a specific DPP-4 inhibitor, Sitagliptin. Furthermore, the administration of the DPP-4 inhibitor reduced the osteogenic changes in hVICs and mVICs by reestablishing the activity of IGF-1 (Figure IX in the online-only Data Supplement), and direct inhibition of IGF1 signaling using IGF-1 receptor antagonist resulted in enhancement of in vitro calcification of hVICs and increased aortic valve calcification in eNOS-/- mice (Figure X in the online-only Data Supplement). These observations suggest a direct relationship between DPP-4 and IGF-1, thereby adding support to the notion that DPP-4 and IGF-1 are key proteins regulating valvular calcification. Considering the current lack of medical therapy for CAVD, these findings have potential clinical implications suggesting a novel target of CAVD with a new molecular mechanism. Because IGF-1 also protects against fibrosis,41,45 an earlier pathological process in CAVD progression,46 targeting the IGF-1 pathway to protect both fibrosis and calcification provides a theoretical advantage to prevent CAVD development and progression, compared with targeting other pathways that affect calcification alone.47,48The most interesting finding in the present study is a regulatory link between VECs and VICs that plays a critical role in the osteogenic transformation of VICs and CAVD progression (Figure VIII in the online-only Data Supplement). The functional relationship between VECs and VICs in the aortic valve is intrinsic to the maintenance of aortic valve tissue homeostasis and the prevention of calcification.49,50 In the present study, we found that NO depletion in human VECs leads to the induction of DPP-4 expression by NF-kB activation in hVICs. Moreover, we noted that the alteration of DPP4 activity induces the suppression of IGF-1 signaling, which leads to the transdifferentiation of VICs to osteogenic cells. These results suggest that the interaction between VECs and VICs is important in regulating DPP-4 activity and IGF-1 signaling as novel mediators of osteogenic transformation of VICs (Figure XI in the online-only Data Supplement). Our findings support the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction contributes to CAVD by initiating the calcification of the neighboring VICs in a paracrine manner.51In summary, we found that DPP-4 was a potential player in aortic valve calcification and showed that DPP-4 could serve as a novel molecular therapeutic target for treating CAVD. Given that no effective treatment option exists other than invasive valve replacement procedures in patients with advanced CAVD, successful repositioning of DPP-4 inhibitors to halt CAVD progression is expected to result in a revolutionary paradigm shift in the management of patients with CAVD.LimitationsWe assessed the levels of DPP-4 or IGF-1 in cultured VICs from patients with CAVD and also in animal models of aortic valve calcification. However, in the present study, it was not possible to fully evaluate whether the plasma levels of DPP-4 and IGF-1 were useful biomarkers for CAVD. In particular, such a finding cannot be made through a single observation in a small cohort of patients with aortic stenosis. Thus, further proof-of-concept studies and applications in a large population are needed to obtain sufficient evidence to support the potential use of DPP-4 and IGF-1 as biomarkers in CAVD. However, the absence of these supporting data would not diminish the importance of the DPP-4–IGF-1 axis in the pathogenesis of CAVD. We believe that the local alterations of DPP-4 activity and IGF-1 signaling in aortic valve tissue, rather than the systemic changes in the plasma, would be more important in the pathophysiological processes leading to CAVD in humans.Although our in vivo observations in mice and rabbits were consistent with in vitro data using VICs from patients with CAVD, the clinical efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors needs to be further tested. Some differences might be found in the distribution of various DPP-4 inhibitors in organs and tissues. Hence, it is crucial to define an adequate dose of a specific DPP-4 inhibitor, in compliance with its tissue distribution, that is most effective for attenuating the nonglycemic function of DPP-4 to halt CAVD progression. Furthermore, the potential impact of our novel pathway on other possible calcification mechanisms, including circulating progenitors,52 endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition,53 and nonosteogenic calcification,54 needs to be evaluated.Thus, our results show that DPP-4-dependent IGF-1 inhibition in VICs contributes to the osteogenic differentiation of valve cells and leads to aortic valve calcification. We believe that this may be a novel mechanism underlying CAVD, and we suggest that DPP-4 could serve as a potential therapeutic target to halt CAVD progression.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to Sung-Cheol Yun, PhD, for providing statistical support.Sources of FundingThis work was supported by grants of the Korea Health Technology R&amp;D Project funded by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea (HI14C19160000), the Basic Science Research Program funded by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (2013R1A1A3010455), the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education (2014R1A6A3A04056205), and the Asan Institute for Life Sciences and Corporate Relations of the Asan Medical Center (14–021).Footnotes*Drs Choi and S.

"Bariatric surgery as a model to explore the basis and consequences of the Reaven hypothesis: Small, dense low-density lipoprotein and interleukin-6","IntroductionThe advent of reliable plasma insulin assays in the 1960s provided the opportunity for Gerald Reaven et al.1 to discover the association between the insulin response to carbohydrate feeding and serum triglyceride levels. Higher insulin responses were associated with higher triglyceride levels.1 Reaven and others went on to report that a constellation of other abnormalities was also associated with an exaggerated insulin response in addition to hypertriglyceridaemia, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or a predisposition to it, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, hypertension, hyperuricaemia and raised plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), fibrinogen and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).2–5 This, he termed 'Syndrome X',2 although it is now more widely known as the metabolic syndrome, particularly when associated with obesity. Initially, Reaven's hypothesis stated that increased insulin levels were the cause of the hypertriglyceridaemia, because insulin was at that time believed to stimulate hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion.1 However, later experiments with adult hepatocytes maintained in tissue culture showed that the primary effect of insulin on hepatic VLDL secretion was inhibitory.6–8 Thus, the hypertriglyceridaemia was due to insulin resistance, rather than hyperinsulinaemia, as previously proposed by Himsworth9 many years previously. Reaven thus modified his hypothesis and extended it to state that both muscle and the liver must be resistant to the action of insulin, at least in relation to their diminished capacity for the uptake of glucose, and therefore, the increased insulin levels were a response to overcome the insulin resistance. That hepatic insulin resistance could also explain the hypertriglyceridaemia of metabolic syndrome and T2DM, was later confirmed in human studies of VLDL kinetics.10–12 Throughout his life Reaven continued to argue, however, that it was impossible using available techniques and models to separate the effects of insulin resistance from the effects of too much insulin in humans.13 It is known that insulin resistance due to inherited insulin receptor defects results in reduced glucose uptake and hyperinsulinaemia, but does not lead to hypertriglyceridaemia or hepatic steatosis.14 However, after its uptake by functioning receptors, insulin regulates multiple intracellular pathways through several signalling mechanisms.15 It therefore remains entirely possible that some of these are resistant to insulin, whereas, as Reaven originally postulated, others are over-stimulated by the hyperinsulinaemia which develops to maintain euglycaemia. When the increased delivery of insulin is inadequate to overcome insulin resistance to glucose uptake, T2DM develops, but the insulin levels are much higher than in healthy, non-obese, people without diabetes.16The provision of evidence that hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance is causal for hypertriglyceridaemia and the other components of the metabolic syndrome was, until the advent of bariatric surgery, hampered by the lack of a means of dramatically reversing it. Drugs which decrease insulin resistance tend to have multiple other actions and the effect of weight reduction through dietary restriction can only be studied when a large proportion of failures are excluded. Bariatric surgery provides a means of substantially and consistently reversing hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance. While the substantial decrease in adiposity may explain this reversal of hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance, additional mechanisms such as changes in gut hormone profiles due to intestinal bypass may contribute. We, and others, have previously reported a decrease in elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and an increase in adiponectin after bariatric surgery.17–20 These cytokines emanate from adipose tissue and those from visceral adipose tissue, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), arrive at the liver via the portal circulation,21 and are believed to be responsible for hepatic resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake.22Quite why the metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) has never been fully explained. Increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and in its major protein moiety, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), which are definitely causal, are not a feature of metabolic syndrome.2,23 Moderate hypertriglyceridaemia, typical of the metabolic syndrome has proved controversial as a cause of CVD,24 and the role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in atherogenesis is currently being re-evaluated.25 We have previously made a preliminary report of a decrease in small, dense low-density lipoprotein (SD-LDL) following bariatric surgery.18 SD-LDL is increased in hypertriglyceridaemia 26–28 and is particularly susceptible to atherogenic modifications, such as oxidation and glycation.29,30 Inflammatory cytokines associated with atherothrombosis may also make a major contribution to CVD in metabolic syndrome.31 In the present study, we have undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the effect of bariatric surgery on insulin secretion and insulin resistance in relation to the change in SD-LDL and IL-6, an upstream regulator of C-reactive protein (CRP),4 as there is emerging evidence from Mendelian randomisation studies that it has a longer term association with CVD than hs-CRP.32,33 We have sought to establish the basis for the change in insulin secretion and insulin resistance after bariatric surgery, to further understand the basis of the Reaven hypothesis.MethodsStudy design and patient recruitmentThis study was a prospective observational cohort study. Forty patients (8 men and 32 women) with obesity were recruited from the pre-bariatric surgery clinic at Salford Royal Hospital, a Tier 4 specialist weight management service in the North West of England. They all underwent Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.Prior ethical approval was sought and granted by the Central Manchester Research and Ethics Committee. All patients were given detailed information about the study and each person provided informed consent before taking part in the study.Patient assessmentsPatients were asked to attend a morning appointment (between 09:00 and 10:30 h) having fasted from 22:00 h at baseline and then 6 and 12 months after bariatric surgery. At each visit, a detailed medical history including medication used was assessed. Each participant underwent measurement of their weight and height and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Blood pressure was measured after resting in a seated position for 15 min, using an Omron HEM 705-CP semiautomatic oscillometric recorder. Fasting venous blood was collected at each visit. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the current revision from the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III.23Complete remission from type 2 diabetes was determined 12 months post-operatively with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) below 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) and no active pharmacological therapy, as per the American Diabetes Association consensus statement.34Laboratory procedures and analysesHbA1c and fasting glucose were assessed in the biochemistry laboratory at Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust using routine methods. The remaining samples were processed in the Cardiovascular Research Lab at the University of Manchester. Laboratory procedures and measurements were carried out according to our previously described protocol.18 Serum and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma were isolated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4°C within 2 h of blood collection. Aliquots for biochemical analysis were frozen at −80°C.Total cholesterol was measured using the cholesterol oxidase phenol 4-aminoantipyrine peroxidase method and triglycerides by the glycerol phosphate oxidase phenol 4-aminoantipyrine peroxidase method. HDL-C was measured using a second-generation homogeneous direct method (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK). LDL-C was estimated using the Friedewald formula.35 ApoB was measured using immunoturbidimetric assays (ABX Diagnostics, Shefford, UK). All these tests were performed on a Cobas Mira analyser (Horiba ABX Diagnostics, Nottingham, UK).Small, dense low-density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B (SD-LDL ApoB; LDL particles of density &gt; 1.044 g/mL) was isolated from plasma and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 r/min (435,680 × g) for 5 h at 4°C using a Beckman Optima TLX bench top ultracentrifuge fitted with TLA 120.2 fixed angle rotor (Beckman Coulter UK).36 ApoB in SD-LDL was then determined using an immunoturbidimetric assay (ABX Diagnostics). SD-LDL is thus expressed in terms of the plasma concentration of its ApoB component.An in-house, antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using anti-human CRP antibody, calibrators and controls from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) was used to measure hs-CRP. IL-6 was measured by ELISA using kits from R&amp;D Systems (Abingdon, UK). The upper limit (95th percentile) for IL-6 in plasma was 3.1 pg/mL.37 Plasma insulin was measured with Mercodia ELISA kits from Diagenics Ltd. (Milton Keynes, UK). Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess insulin resistance,38 using the formulaHOMA-IR=[insulin(mU/L)×glucose(mmol/L)]/22.5The laboratories participated in the UK National External Quality Assessment Service (UKNEQAS, Birmingham, UK) for quality control of general blood chemistry.Statistical analysisSPSS for Mac (Version 23.0; IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and GraphPad Prism (Version 7.00; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) were used for analysis of data. Tests for normality were done using the Shapiro–Wilk test, visualisation of histograms and Q-Q plots. When more than two time points were being compared, one-way ANOVA was used for parametric data and Friedman's two-way analysis of variance by Ranks was used for non-parametric data. Specific post hoc pairwise comparisons were done using the Bonferroni correction in SPSS. The McNemar test was used to compare paired categorical variables. The percentage change in variables was determined as the absolute difference between measurements 12 months after surgery and baseline divided by the baseline value (and multiplied by 100). Correlation analysis was done using Pearson's test for parametric and Spearman's test for non-parametric data. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.DiscussionThis study shows that a marked reduction in hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance in obese people after bariatric surgery ameliorates not only raised triglycerides, hs-CRP and low HDL-C, features of the Reaven syndrome,2 but also SD-LDL and IL-6, irrespective of the presence of T2DM or statin therapy.SD-LDL concentration increases with triglyceride levels.26 It is a cholesterol-depleted low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the presence of which is not evident from measurement of LDL-C. It contributes to total serum ApoB and is the cause of hyperapobetalipoproteinaemia,39 but the majority of ApoB-containing lipoproteins are of lower density so that even when total ApoB is measured its presence may not be obvious. It is likely that it is the cause of the association between hypertriglyceridaemia and CVD.24,26,27 SD-LDL is more susceptible both to oxidative and glycative modification than less dense LDL species.29,30 Both oxidatively modified and glycated LDL, unlike more buoyant, unmodified LDL, are rapidly taken up via scavenger receptors on macrophages in tissue culture to become foam cells similar to those in atheromatous lesions.40 In our series of patients, the SD-LDL concentration of 22.1 mg/dL at baseline declined to 10.2 mg/dL 12 months after bariatric surgery, restoring its levels close to the median value in a healthy population (14 mg/dL for men and 9 mg/dL for women).41A raised level of hs-CRP is recognised as a feature of metabolic syndrome2 and is closely associated to the risk of developing CVD.4 However, evidence that hs-CRP is causally related to CVD has not been forthcoming.4 On the other hand IL-6, a major regulator of hepatic CRP secretion, unlike CRP, has been found in Mendelian randomisation studies to be linked to atherosclerosis.4,32,33 Many adipokines are released both from peripheral and visceral adipose tissue, which have the potential to contribute to hepatic insulin resistance and secretion of CRP, but those released from visceral fat may have a special place in the genesis of the metabolic syndrome, because they arrive at the liver through the portal vein and may do so at higher concentration than those arriving by the hepatic artery after dilution in the systemic circulation. IL-6 was found in much higher concentration in portal blood than in systemic arterial blood by Fontana et al.21 in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery for obesity. Tumour necrosis factor-α, resistin, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 and adiponectin concentrations were similar in the portal vein and radial artery. Portal vein IL-6 concentration also correlated directly with systemic CRP. The decrease in IL-6 after bariatric surgery, suggests that it could be associated with the decrease in hs-CRP and other features of hepatic insulin resistance. Recently, reduction in IL-6 levels similar to that reported here, but achieved by administration of a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-1β, was reported to be associated with decreased atherosclerotic CVD incidence.31The findings of this and earlier reports in which the effects of the decrease in insulin resistance accompanying weight loss on components of the metabolic syndrome have been investigated,17–20 provide powerful support for Reaven's hypothesis. Bariatric surgery which induces the most dramatic decreases in hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance is a model which could yield an even greater understanding of, for example, the mechanism by which atheroma risk is increased. Our finding of a decrease in SD-LDL should lead to exploration of the effects of weight loss due to bariatric surgery on modified, potentially highly atherogenic LDL subspecies, such as oxidised and glycated LDL. Furthermore, it could lead to some resolution of the conflict which exists between which components of the metabolic (Reaven) syndrome are due to resistance to insulin (too little insulin action) and which are due to hyperinsulinaemia itself (too much insulin action). In recent years, it has often been forgotten that, because insulin regulates several intracellular signalling pathways controlling a variety of processes, while its effects will be deficient in pathways resistant to it, in others the high levels of insulin produced to attempt to maintain euglycaemia may hyperstimulate non-resistant pathways. An example might be the regulation of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG), which is decreased in insulin resistance, leading to increased free androgen levels in both men and women.42,43 This at least partly explains the androgenisation of insulin resistant women and thus their male pattern (visceral; central) obesity and hirsutism. Despite the association of insulin resistance with decreased SHBG, however, tissue culture experiments with human hepatocytes reveal insulin to have an inhibitory action on SHBG production.44,45 Thus, unlike the VLDL production pathway where insulin resistance decreases the inhibitory effect of insulin despite the increase in its concentration in response to resistance to glucose uptake, the pathway for the production of SHBG must escape resistance to the action of insulin and be inhibited by hyperinsulinaemia. The model of bariatric surgery may provide opportunities for futher study of this mechanism as it may for other phenomena associated with the hyperinsulinaemia of insulin resistance, such as the pathways linking metabolic syndrome to hyperuricaemia.46It has been difficult to distinguish components of the metabolic syndrome due to resistance to insulin action and those hyperstimulated by the ensuing increase in insulin secretion to maintain euglycaemia as first discussed in Kim and Reaven.13 We found that the strength of the associations between change in components of the metabolic syndrome, such as triglycerides and HDL-C, and change in fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were similar with perhaps the suggestion that triglyceride concentration was more closely related to insulin resistance and HDL-C to fasting insulin levels. It has been suggested that the insulin clamp technique would be a better means of assessing insulin resistance rather than HOMA-IR, which relies on the ratio between fasting insulin and glucose.38 However, this argument is less persuasive when it is considered that in insulin clamping, the insulin is administered into the systemic rather than the portal circulation into which it is secreted physiologically.47 This means that physiologically the liver is subject to much higher levels than peripheral tissues and the insulin clamp is thus measuring insulin resistance to glucose uptake in tissues, such as skeletal muscle, while hepatic uptake is relatively unaffected by insulin arriving by the hepatic artery. Presumably, HOMA-IR, however, represents the contribution of both hepatic and peripheral glucose disposal. At the time of bariatric surgery, direct measurement of hormones and metabolites in portal venous blood can be undertaken,21 but repetition of this after weight loss is not possible, at least in human models. Nonetheless, discovering which processes are resistant to insulin and which are over-stimulated by the accompanying hyperinsulinaemia could be important therapeutically.We conclude that bariatric surgery provides an excellent model to dissect Reaven's hypothesis, to discover the mechanisms by which its components, such as raised SD-LDL and IL-6, cause atherosclerosis. It also raises questions about the respective roles of insulin resistance and of hyperinsulinaemia on different components of the metabolic syndrome.1.Reaven, GM, Lerner, RL, Stern, MP.

Eating and pumping: evaluating the nutrition service of the insulin pump clinic at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. (Insight: Original Research).,"Abstract Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a nutritioninformation session in an insulin pump clinic in improving knowledge andfood choices, and to assess patient satisfaction with the session. Design: An eight-part self-administered questionnaire. Subjects: Twenty-five patients who had attended insulin pumptraining from August 2000 to July 2001 were invited by mail toparticipate in the study. Setting: Insulin pump 'stabilisation clinic' at The RoyalMelbourne Hospital, Victoria. Main outcome measures: Patient-rated usefulness of the writteninformation, retention of nutrition messages, dietary changes made andbest aspects of the program. Results: Sixteen patients responded. Eleven had attended thenutrition session and of these ten received written information. Fourpatients reported carbohydrate counting and glycaemic index as the mostuseful information. Of the 11, eight demonstrated retention of messagesconsistent with nutrition information provided; five made dietarychanges; six reported the best thing about the nutrition session wasconfirmation that their knowledge and food practice was in line withcurrent recommendations; and four suggested a follow-up session and moretime with the dietitian as improvements. Conclusion: Patient-reported improvements in dietary practice andpositive feedback about the nutrition sessions indicate the value ofdietetic education in the insulin pump clinic. As the number of patientstreated with insulin pumps increases in Australia, sharing ofinformation and nutrition research is encouraged to develop bestpractice. Key words: insulin pump, diabetes mellitus, dietary counselling,nutrition education Introduction The importance of nutrition intervention by a dietitian fordiabetes management is well accepted (1,2) and leads to improved healthoutcomes (3,4). In particular, dietary advice on carbohydrate foods isan integral part of nutrition intervention because of the evidence thatdifferent carbohydrate foods affect blood glucose control (5). Through the 1990s the findings of the Diabetes Control andComplications Trial (DCCT) (6) have led to more intensive insulintreatment, designed to normalise glycosylated haemoglobin ([HbA.sub.1C]). One approach used in the DCCT was treatment with insulinpumps, referred to as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. This isa relatively common form of treatment in the US but until recently, hasbeen uncommon in Australia. However, the increased publicity regardingthe positive outcomes with insulin pump therapy (7-9) has led manypatients to seek this treatment in Australia. The insulin pump providesa continuous basal infusion of short acting insulin to reduce hepaticglucose production and normalise glucose in the fasting state thusmimicking the normal function of the pancreas. Before meals, the personinfuses a predetermined bolus of insulin, the dose being based on thecarbohydrate content of the food to be eaten and the blood glucoseconcentration. This treatment approach allows greater flexibility inlifestyle and food choices. A clinic specifically designed to commence people on an insulinpump was established at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. To date, therehave been no published reports of such clinics in Australia, and noreports on the role of the dietitian in these clinics. From theinception of the clinic at the hospital, a dietitian has worked closelywith the diabetes educator and endocrinologist to provide education andadvice aimed at promoting self-care and effective management of diabetesfor people using an insulin pump. Patients commencing with the pump at the hospital undergoone-and-a-half days of training with the diabetes educator to learn tooperate the pump and to set the initial basal rates and pre-mealboluses. The nutrition session is held at the end of the second half-dayand is normally 45 to 60 minutes' duration. Patients training inpairs attend the nutrition session together. For the insulin pump to beeffective, patients must learn to match pre-meal insulin boluses withmeals through carbohydrate counting (10,11). Being able to provide thisinformation in a practical way is an important role for the dietitian inthese clinics (12). Written information available in the nutrition session includesinformation on carbohydrate exchanges and glycaemic index (GI),developed by the hospital's Nutrition Department, and theSanitarium[R] booklets, 'Facts on fat' and 'Sugarupdate'. Most patients attending the clinic have had diabetes formany years and have had previous intervention from a dietitian, butinformal feedback from patients indicated that the information formerlyprovided might not be meeting their needs. The objective of this studywas to determine whether the nutrition information provided was usefuland resulted in improved knowledge and food choices, as rated by thepatients. Method Of the 27 patients who attended the insulin pump clinic from August2000 to July 2001, 25 were invited by mail to participate in the study.This included those who did not attend a nutrition session. Two patientswere less than 18 years old and therefore were not eligible toparticipate. Patients received a package that included a letter ofinvitation, an eight-part self-administered questionnaire (copiesavailable from author) and a stamped self-addressed envelope. A reminderletter was sent one week after the due date to encourage participation. The questionnaire was not previously piloted and included questionsabout age, occupation, height, weight, and the month of attendance atthe clinic. Patients were also asked to indicate the written informationthey received, if they read it, whether it was useful to them, and torecall one of the messages from the nutrition session. Patients wereasked to state whether they had altered their diet, reasons they had notdone so, or if they had, what changes they made. The questionnaire usedopen-ended questions about the most and least useful aspects of thenutrition session and a question about how the nutrition service couldbe improved. The latter question had prompts such as need for follow-up,relevance, further learning requirements and presence of others in thesession. As the number of subjects is small, statistical analyses areinappropriate and the results presented are a descriptive summary. This project was approved by The Royal Melbourne Hospital ClinicalResearch and Ethics Committee as part of routine patient care. Results Of the 25 people invited to participate, 16 responded. Of these 16,11 had attended both the pump training and the nutrition informationsession. Four were unable to attend the nutrition session due to othercommitments and/or the dietitian being unavailable, and the remainingpatient reported he did not require further nutrition education. Table 1summarises the demographics of the 16 patients. Of the 11 who attended the pump training and nutrition session, tenreceived written information. All ten reported reading through theinformation. Four found the information on carbohydrate counting and GIuseful, two reported the sugar update useful, and one found informationon fats useful (see Table 2). Five patients reported making dietarychanges. These included using margarine instead of butter, using lowerGI cereal, including lower GI snacks, changing type of rice eaten,counting carbohydrate more carefully and observing the effects ofdifferent carbohydrate types on blood glucose concentration morecarefully. Those who did attend but did not make a dietary changereported that this was because they were already following an eatingplan that was consistent with recommended guidelines. In contrast, thefive patients who had not attended the nutrition session reported nodietary changes had been made since attending the clinic. The 11 patients who attended the nutrition information session wereasked to recall one message from the session. Eight messages recalledwere consistent with information provided in the nutrition session, twowere not, and one did not respond. Ten respondents provided feedback on'the best thing about the nutrition session'. Six of the tenreported confirmation that they were doing the right things and tworeported the session to be a good update. One patient responded thattheir blood glucose concentration had improved as a result of increasedmotivation and implementation of improved food choices after attendingthe nutrition session. In response to 'the worst thing about thenutrition session', there were four responses. Two were abouthaving to make changes to their dietary practice, one reported theinformation was too broad and the other patient attending dominated thesession, and the remaining patient reported that there was noinformation on the effect of protein on blood sugar concentrations. On 'improving the nutrition service', four patientsrecommended a follow-up session, three suggested more time with thedietitian, and one recommended individual sessions. Otherrecommendations included e-mail access to the dietitian, provision of alist of relevant web sites, a newsletter, eating a meal out with thedietitian to practice carbohydrate counting in a restaurant, andrecipes. Discussion In this study we assessed improvements in dietary knowledge andfood choices, and patient satisfaction with a nutrition informationsession for patients commencing on an insulin pump. The Humber of participants in this study is small, but this form ofinsulin treatment is new and few centres have more than one or twopatients using a pump. Therefore, the results presented in this paperare a summary and have been qualitatively evaluated. A limitation ofthis study is that those who were invited to participate, but did notrespond, may have different views from those who participated. Despitethis, we believe the information provided by patients was informativeand provides a starting point to guide provision of nutritioninformation to patients commencing on an insulin pump. Patients who attended the clinic were generally well educated andwithin a healthy weight range. Few patients found the writteninformation on fat and sugar useful. This is expected as information onfat and sugar is of a more general nature, than GI and carbohydratecounting which are comparatively more complex. The dietitian determinedthe level of patient's knowledge during the consultation and on thebasis of this patients were given appropriate written information.Therefore, not all patients received all available written information. Overall, patients who attended the nutrition session respondedpositively to nutrition education, reporting that even if a specificdietary change had not been made, it improved their confidence with foodchoices. In contrast, those that had not attended the nutrition sessiondid not report any dietary change. Although numbers are small, thisprovides evidence that attendance at the nutrition session should beencouraged and become part of standard practice. It has been suggested that for people with an insulin pump, therecan be an overemphasis on carbohydrate counting that can result inreduced carbohydrate intake and an increase in fat intake (11). This wasnot assessed in this study, but as carbohydrate counting is a keycomponent of nutrition education, it is suggested that a diet historypre- and post-nutrition intervention be used to monitor such dietarychange. Body weight, fat intake, haemaglobin [A.sub.1c] and serum lipids should also be included as routine measures in the clinic. Such measureswould provide objective evidence when researching the role of medicalnutrition therapy in insulin pump treatment. There is currently no suchresearch reported in the literature. Practice guidelines for medical nutrition therapy by dietitians forthe management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes are available (13) andreport that patients are more likely to be successful in improvingdiabetes management with ongoing nutrition therapy rather than a singlenutrition session (12,13). In this study, two people recalled nutritionmessages that were not consistent with information provided during thesession. A follow-up session would be of benefit to ensure correctinformation is retained. Four patients stated that a follow-up sessionwould have been useful. Follow-up sessions are currently beinginvestigated at the hospital's clinic with the model expected to bereferral to a dietitian in community or private practice when thepatient leaves the hospital clinic and returns to his or her ownendocrinologist. In conclusion, following attendance at the nutrition informationsession, improvements in behaviour and food choices were reported, andpatients gave positive feedback about their nutrition session. Insulinpump clinics also provide an avenue for research in medical nutritiontherapy. A collegial approach to patient care with sharing ofinformation, research and expertise is encouraged as the number ofpatients using pump therapy increases.Table 1Demographic information on the 16 patients responding to the mailedquestionnaireCharacteristicAge (years) 31 to 50 (range)Education 9 with tertiary qualificationsWeight (kg) 69 [+ or -] (mean [+ or -] SD)BMI (kg/[m.sup.2]) 25 [+ or -] (mean [+ or -] SD)Table 2Number of patients who received written information and patient- ratedusefulness of it.

Upon transfer to the cardiac surgery division, if fasting glucose was ≥130 mg/dl, a basal + premeal insulin therapy was initiated (121 patients, group 1); for &lt;130 mg/dl, a premeal insulin alone was initiated (691 patients, group 2).FindingsCompared with group 2, group 1 showed reductions in PIC (2.48% vs 7.96%, p &lt; 0.049; odds ratio: 0.294; 95% CI: 0.110–0.780), C-Reactive Protein (p &lt; 0.05) and white blood cell (p &lt; 0.05) levels despite glucose levels and CIII that were higher during the first two days after surgery (179.8 ± 25.3 vs 169.5 ± 10.6 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.01; 0.046 ± 0.008 vs 0.037 ± 0.015 U/kg/h, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Normal glucose levels were achieved in both groups from day 3 before the discharge. The mean length of hospital duration was 18% lower in group 1 than in group 2 (7.21 ± 05.08 vs 8.76 ± 9.08 days, p &lt; 0.007), providing a significant impact on public health costs.ConclusionsBasal + preprandial insulin therapy was associated with a lower frequency of PIC than preprandial insulin therapy alone, suggesting a beneficial effect of basal insulin therapy on post-surgery outcome.Abbreviations: PIC, postoperative infective complications; BIT, basal insulin therapy; PCP, perioperative cardiosurgery period; CIII, continuous intravenous insulin infusion; DM, diabetes mellitus; ICU, intensive care units; CRP, C-Reactive Protein; WBC, white blood cellKeywords: Insulin therapy, Cardiac surgery, Post-surgery infections, Hyperglycemia, HypoglycemiaIntroductionIt is well recognized that inadequate perioperative glucose control is a predictor of postoperative infection rates, worse wound healing, recurrent ischemic events, increased duration of hospital stay and overall short- and long-term mortality [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].The benefit of glucose control for patients undergoing surgery has been shown in many previous studies. Following cardiac surgery glucose control provides benefits even to patients without pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM) [1], [5], [6]. However, intensive insulin therapy is consistently associated with increased risk for severe hypoglycemia, which may outweigh the potential benefits of reducing blood glucose [7].According to the current published guidelines, a glycemic goal of 140–180 mg/dl is optimal in intensive care units (ICU) while tighter control of circulating glucose (110–140 mg/dl) may be appropriate in selected patients, as long as this can be achieved without a significant risk for hypoglycemia [8]. On the other hand, several studies have found an important association between hyperglycemia and susceptibility to bacterial infection [9], [10], although the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Animal studies have shown that insulin modulates the production and release of cytokines, the expression of adhesion molecules and neutrophil migration during the course of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung inflammation [11]. Therefore, it could be possible that an increase in circulating insulin levels by exogenous insulin therapy could be beneficial in the perioperative setting. According with the knowledge of physiologic insulin secretion, we evolved into the use of regimens that incorporate both the basal and bolus insulin therapy.In agreement with this hypothesis, intensive insulin therapy reduces morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients [5], [12] and may increase neutrophil activity and phagocytosis in patients following major surgery [13]. On the other hand, it is very difficult to differentiate the effect of insulin per se on the postoperative infective complications from the effects which insulin has in reducing these risks through lowering blood sugar levels.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a retrospective analysis to determine the association between a constant increase in insulin levels by the use of basal insulin therapy, independent of glucose levels, and a possible improvement of postoperative infective complications after cardiac surgery. This study selected patients admitted for cardiac interventions, where a continuous intravenous insulin infusion (CIII) for an acute increase of glucose levels was undertaken. On the day of the transfer of the patient to the cardiac surgery unit patients were divided into two groups: in one group, where fasting glucose was ≥130 mg/dl, a basal + premeal insulin was started. In the other group, where fasting glucose was &lt;130 mg/dl, premeal insulin alone was administered. This allowed the comparison of the effect of a constant versus an intermittent increase in insulin levels on post cardiac-surgery infections.Secondary outcomes included differences between treatment groups in daily circulating glucose concentration, the occurrence of mild or severe hypoglycemia, the length of hospital stay and the occurrence of any of the following post-surgery complications: stroke, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, heart failure, low cardiac output syndrome, acute atrial fibrillation, anemia or exitus.Materials and methodsElegible populationThis was a retrospective chart review from a single cardiac surgery center. Patients who had undergone cardiac surgery were identified according to these inclusion criteria and they had to meet both 1 and 2:1)patients with or without DM admitted for cardiac surgery due to mitral or aortic valve disease, affected by ischemic heart disease, or both;2)patients, who during the cardiac surgery intervention period, required treatment with continuous intravenous insulin infusion (CIII) for an acute increase of circulating glucose levels (blood glucose ≥130 mg/dl on two assessments during surgery);Exclusion criteria were:1)Patients with cancer, undergoing chronically outpatient steroid therapy, or with type-1 DM.2)Patients with clinically relevant hepatic disease, with serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dl, or with a history of hyperglycemia before admission during the last 3 months (HbA1c &gt; 10%).From January 2009 to December 2011, 2114 patients underwent surgery in the cardiac division (cardiac valve repair or replace surgery alone in 1637 patients, cardiac revascularization surgery alone in 284 patients or both cardiac revascularization surgery and cardiac valve repair or replace surgery in 193 patients).Among these, 812 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and were analyzed and the clinical characteristics of this population are presented in .Table 1Clinical characteristics and medical history of patients requiring continuous intravenous insulin infusion during the cardiac surgery period for an acute increase of circulating glucose levels (blood glucose was ≥130 mg/dl on two assessments during surgery) from 01 March 2009 to 30 November 2011.No. of patients812Period of hospitalization01 March 2009 to 30 November 2011Age (years)62.50 ± 11.50Sex (Males/Females)511/302No. of patients with valve disease (VD)633No. of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD)96No. of patients with VD and IHD83Co-morbidities: Diabetes mellitus95 Hypertension674Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease85 Chronic atrial fibrillation195Body weight (kg)73.04 ± 14.03Body mass index (kg/m2)25.62 ± 4.15Fasting glucose (mg/dl)*100.3 ± 23.7Glycated Hemoglobin (%)*5.52 ± 1.38Creatinine (mg/dl)*0.92 ± 0.37BUN (mg/dl)*46.92 ± 18.85Plasma albumin (mg/dl)*41.49 ± 3.84Hemoglobin (g/dl)*13.58 ± 1.62Study designAll subjects underwent cardiac surgeries including mitral valve replacement/repair, aortic valve replacement/repair, cardiac revascularization surgery or a combination of the aforementioned surgeries.Consultation with a diabetologist was performed daily throughout the pre-operative, perioperative and post-surgery period to optimize the insulin therapy.During the surgery period, if the blood glucose was ≥130 mg/dl on two assessments, a CIII was initiated and continued after transfer to the cardiovascular intensive care unit. Glucose was assessed hourly by arterial blood gases intra-operatively and every 30–120 min while in the cardiovascular intensive care unit. The same insulin infusion protocol was continued postoperatively, using the same criteria with a blood glucose target of ≤120 mg/dl. If the blood glucose reached ≤80 mg/dl, the infusion was halted and restarted only if the threshold of 130 mg/dl was reached again.On the day of transfer from the cardiovascular intensive care unit to the cardiac surgery division, patients were fasting and the insulin infusion was stopped, if present. After 3–4 h, if the capillary fasting glucose levels were ≥130 mg/dl a basal + premeal insulin therapy was started. This occurred with 121 patients (isophane, i.e., protophane every 12 h, in 69 patients, detemir every 12 h in 50 patients and glargine every 24 h in 2 patients; group 1). The initial insulin dose of basal insulin was determined as 50% of the estimated insulin requirements of the previous 24 h, during the cardiovascular intensive care unit period (usually between 0.2 to 0.5 U/kg body weight). Conversely, if the capillary fasting glucose was &lt;130 mg/dl, a premeal insulin alone administration was started (691 patients; group 2). The doses of premeal insulin (aspart insulin) therapy were adjusted according to a pre-specified protocol (breakfast: 0.05–0.10 U/kg, lunch: 0.10–0.30 U/kg; dinner 0.10–0.20 U/kg).The decision to start insulin therapy if baseline blood sugar levels were above 130 mg/dl in these patients was contained in the internal guidelines established since 2008 from doctors diabetologists and physicians of surgical departments, endorsed by the Institute's Health Department. The ability to start insulin sc therapy at levels ≥130 mg/dl was based on the daily valuation of diabetologists who interacted with nurses and doctors of the department so as to optimize insulin therapy and reduce the possible hypoglycemic episodes.There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding age, gender, BMI, creatinine, BUN, plasma albumin, hemoglobin and other co-morbidities except for the presence of DM in group 1, which was significantly higher than in group 2 (19.8% vs 9.6%, p &lt; 0.01). However, fasting glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin were not significantly different, being 100.1 ± 22.1 mg/dl and 5.55 ± 1.23% in group 1 and 100.9 ± 23.8 mg/dl and 5.51 ± 1.41% in group 2 (p = 0.93 and p = 0.69, respectively, ).Table 2Clinical Characteristics and co-morbidities of patients.

All blood glucose check times were standardized and occurred at 7:30 am (fasting, before breakfast), 12:00 pm (before lunch), 6:00 pm (before dinner) and 12:00 am.Outcome measuresThe primary outcome of the study was the difference between treatment groups in the composite of major postoperative infective complications according to Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network Criteria determined by chart review for each patient [14]: deep incisional surgical infection, mediastinitis, infection endocarditis, cardiac device infection, pneumonia and bloodstream infection.The secondary outcomes determined by chart review for each patient included differences between treatment groups in daily capillary blood glucose concentrations, the occurrence of mild or severe hypoglycemia (&lt;70 mg/dl and &lt;40 mg/dl, respectively, 15), the length of hospital stay and the occurrence of any of the following post-surgery complications: the occurrence in temperature ≥38.5 °C at least 3 days after surgery [16] associated with increase in WBC ≥ 10.0 × 103/mm3[17] and CRP ≥114 mg/l [18] six days after surgery as indirect index of infection complication, stroke, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, heart failure, low cardiac output syndrome, acute fibrillation, anemia or exitus.Statistical methodsContinuous variables were expressed as the mean ± SD median and were compared using the unpaired t-test. Categorical variables were expressed as number with percentage and were compared using the Chi-Square test. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of group 1, with patients of group 2 as a reference. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).Calculation of the sample sizeThe calculation of the sample size was calculated analyzing previous studies in which 7.1% of subjects submitted to basal insulin (either as CIII or sc therapy), and 23.7% of subjects treated with sliding scale regular insulin sc therapy, showed infective complications after cardio or general surgery [15], [19], [20]. In the present study, we aimed to detect a minimal difference of 50% in the primary outcome between treatments with a 2-sided type error protection of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Therefore, we estimated that the required sample size was at least 115 subjects for each group; we optimized the power of the study with a ratio of 1:6.Ethics statementThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of IRCCS San Raffaele Institute, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.ResultsEvaluation of clinical outcomesAs shown in , the composite of postoperative infective complications was found in 2.48% and in 7.96% of the patients in group 1 and in group 2, respectively (p &lt; 0.049). The risk of presenting with these complications was reduced by almost 70% in group 1 compared with group 2, with an odds ratio of 0.294 (95% CI; 0.111–0.780). The most common organisms identified in the bloodstream infection cultures were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, psedomonas, Escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis. In confirmation of this result, the risk of presenting with temperature ≥38.5 °C at least 3 days after surgery associated with increase in WBC ≥ 10.0 × 103/mm3 and CRP ≥ 114 mg/l six days after surgery was decreased by 70% (1.65% vs 5.21%) in group 1 compared to group 2, with an odds ratio of 0.306 (95% CI; 0.094–0.999).Table 3Composite hospital complications and outcomes.All (%)Group 1 (%)Group 2 (%)P valueOdd Ratio (IC 95%)PostoperativeInfection complications58 (7.14)3 (2.48)55 (7.96)0.0490.294 (0.110–0780)Wound infection10 (1.23)1 (0.83)9 (1.30)Mediastinitis5 (0.62)0 (0.00)5 (0.72)Endocarditis3 (0.37)0 (0.00)3 (0.43)Cardiac device infection2 (0.25)0 (0.00)2 (0.29)Pneumonia9 (1.11)0 (0.00)9 (1.30)bloodstream infection29 (3.57)2 (1.65)27 (3.91)Temperature ≥ 38.5 °C + WBC ≥ 10.0x103/mm3 + CRP ≥ 114 mg/dl*38 (4.68)2 (1.65)36 (5.21)0.140.306 (0.094–0.999)Acute atrial fibrillation237 (29.19)42 (34.71)195 (28.22)0.181.350 (0.989–1.848)Low cardiac output syndrome140 (17.24)17 (14.05)123 (17.80)0.380.755 (0.478–1.191)Pericardial effusion52 (6.40)4 (3.31)48 (6.95)0.190.458 (1.188–1.116)Stroke5 (0.62)1 (0.83)4 (0.58)0.750.431 (0.191–10.743)Myocardial infarction4 (0.49)1 (0.83)3 (0.43)0.891.912 (0.363–10.050)Anemization201 (24.75)28 (23.14)173 (25.04)0.220.742 (0.504–1.093)Acute respiratory failure113 (13.92)19 (15.70)94 (13.60)0.631.183 (0.756–1.850)Heart failure163 (20.03)17 (14.05)146 (21.13)0.090.610 (0.383–0.971)Acute kidney failure133 (16.38)22 (18.18)111 (16.06)0.651.161 (0.758–1.780)Mortality**9 (1.11)1 (0.82)8 (1.16)0.43Mild hypoglycemia (&lt;70 mg/dl)46 (5.67)18 (14.88)28 (4.05)0.00014.140 (2.626–6.522)Severe hypoglycemia (&lt;40 mg/dl)5 (0.61)1 (0.83)4 (0.58)0.751.430 (0.272–7.526)Length of stay (days)8.54 ± 8.627.21 ± 5.088.76 ± 9.080.007No significant differences were found when evaluating the other secondary outcomes in the two groups, except for the length of hospital stay and the presence of mild hypoglycemic episodes. The mean length of hospital stay was 18% lower in group 1 than in group 2 (7.21 ± 05.08 vs 8.76 ± 9.08 days, p &lt; 0.007) despite the risk of presenting with mild hypoglycemia being increased by almost four times in group 1 compared with group 2 (odds ratio 4.140, 95% CI; 2.626–6.522) However, no differences were found in evaluating the risk for severe hypoglycemic episodes between the two groups (odd ratio 1.430; 95% CI; 0.272–7.526).Inflammatory markers during the perioperative periodBefore the surgery, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) levels were 6.19 ± 14.86 mg/l and 6.85 ± 2.10 × 103/mm3 in group 1 and 5.38 ± 10.68 mg/l and 6.75 ± 1.91 × 103/mm3 in group 2 (N.S.).After surgery, CRP and WBC increased, with the highest levels being at day 2, after which the levels decreased but remained higher than baseline levels in both groups (). Conversely, CRP and WBC levels were lower in group 1 than in group 2 from day 2 to the day of discharge (, p &lt; 0.05 two days and six days after surgery and discharge for both).Table 4Inflammatory marker profiles during the perioperative periodGroup 1Group 2P valueC Protein Reactive (mg/l)Before the surgery6.19 ± 14.865.38 ± 10.680.572 days after surgery178.18 ± 73.49193.05 ± 76.03&lt;0.054 days after surgery146.70 ± 79.43156.38 ± 125.200.416 days after surgery95.40 ± 59.44111.23 ± 73.55&lt;0.05Discharge81.34 ± 56.0294.39 ± 67.25&lt;0.05White Blood Cells (103/mm3)Before the surgery6.85 ± 2.106.75 ± 1.910.622 days after surgery14.97 ± 6.0116.40 ± 5.80&lt;0.054 days after surgery9.80 ± 3.089.90 ± 3.620.756 days after surgery8.97 ± 3.249.71 ± 3.99&lt;0.05Discharge8.87 ± 2.789.52 ± 5.07&lt;0.05Glucose levels and insulin requirement during the during the perioperative period ()Glucose levels and insulin therapy during the perioperative period. Glucose levels (A) were significantly higher in group 1 (basal + pre-meal insulin therapy, black lines and squares) than in group 2 (pre-meal insulin therapy, black lines and white diamonds) from immediately after surgery until day 2 post-surgery. Rapid insulin administration (B) during the surgery and on day 1 after the surgery, was performed intravenously (U/kg/hr) in the intensive care unit, with the amount being significantly higher in group 1 (black histograms) than in group 2 (white histograms). From day two after surgery to discharge, rapid insulin was administered subcutaneously (U/kg) and the amount was similar in both groups. Rapid insulin in the ICU was regular insulin while in the cardio-surgery ward was aspart insulin. Basal insulin administration (C, black histograms) started from day 2 after surgery until discharge in group 1. Basal insulin in the cardio surgery ward was isophane, i.e., protophane every 12 h, in 69 patients, detemir every 12 h in 50 patients and glargine every 24 h in 2 patients. (*): p &lt; 0.05 group 1 vs group 2. (**): p &lt; 0.01 group 1 vs group 2.Surgery period Before surgery, glucose levels were 100.1 ± 22.1 and 100.3 ± 23.8 mg/dl in group 1 and group 2, respectively (N.S.). The mean glucose levels during surgery were 137.9 ± 41.5 and 116.0 ± 27.9 mg/dl, respectively (p &lt; 0.01) despite the CIII being significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (0.10 ± 0.11 vs 0.04 ± 0.03 U/kg/h, p &lt; 0.01).Cardiovascular intensive care unit period During this period (from immediately after surgery until day 1 post-surgery), glucose levels remained significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (maximum glucose level: 179.8 ± 25.3 vs 169.5 ± 10.6 mg/dl, respectively, p &lt; 0.01) despite the CIII remaining significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (0.046 ± 0.008 vs 0.037 ± 0.015 U/kg/h, p &lt; 0.05).Cardiac surgery division period Glucose levels were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 only during day 2 post-surgery: (capillary fasting glucose: 170.4 ± 43.7 vs 120.4 ± 13.9 mg/dl; p &lt; 0.001, respectively) while from day 3 to the day of discharge glucose levels were almost normalized either at fasting or postprandially in both groups (). During this period, the amount of premeal insulin was similar in both groups, ranging between 0.21 ± 0.18 and 0.34 ± 0.35 U/kg/day in group 1 and between 0.18 ± 0.14 and 0.34 ± 0.37 U/kg/day in group 2 (). Basal insulin therapy, administered only in group 1, ranged between 0.26 ± 0.18 and 0.35 ± 0.20 U/kg/day.During the stay in the cardiovascular intensive care unit and in the cardiac surgery division, there were 18 and 28 episodes of mild hypoglycemia (glucose levels &lt;70 mg/dl) in group 1 and 2, respectively, (p &lt; 0.0001) while there was only 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia (glucose levels &lt;40 mg/dl) in group 1 and 4 episodes of severe hypoglycemia in group 2 (p = 0.75). In the present study we reported the total number of hypoglycemic episodes and not the number of patients that showed hypoglycemic episodes. This implies that there may have been more patients who experienced more than one episode of hypoglycemia.DiscussionBasal insulin therapy and postoperative infective complicationsThis study was designed to evaluate whether a constant increase in circulating insulin levels due to a basal insulin administration per se, independent of glycemic levels, could influence the composite of postoperative infective complications [14] after cardiac surgery. We found that these complications after cardiac surgery were significantly decreased by the constant increase of circulating insulin levels (basal + premeal insulin therapy) compared with an intermittent insulin increase (premeal insulin alone therapy).). In fact, the risk of presenting with these composite infective complications was reduced by almost 70% in group 1 compared with group 2 with an odds ratio of 0.294 (95% CI; 0.110–0.780), although glycemic levels were significantly increased in the former group of patients during surgery and in the two days after surgery. It is also important to note that in both groups of patients, glucose levels were always below 180 mg/dl as suggested by the local and international guidelines [9]. In group 1, to achieve a rapid steady state, basal insulin was administered twice a day with isophane insulin (protophane insulin) or detemir insulin with a therapeutic goal obtained 24 h later. Conversely, as the biological half-life of insulin aspart is only 2–4 h, this therapy was unable to ensure an adequate constant increase of basal insulin levels when administered premeal three times a day.Previous studies have demonstrated that continuous insulin, either CIII or sc therapy, improves daily glucose profiles and composite hospital infective complications compared with sliding scale regular insulin therapy [15], [20].Insulin effects on immune cellsInsulin exerts its effects on immune cells by binding to the insulin receptor, which is extensively expressed on immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, determines regulatory properties of insulin, both for the antimicrobial and for the inflammatory response in infection [21], [22], [23]. In fact, the presence of insulin resistance, with decreased insulin action is associated with increased susceptibility to invasive bacterial infections [9], [10], [24], [25]. An immuno-modulatory effect of insulin has been experimentally demonstrated in a mouse model [26]. Moreover, Kenzel et al., [27] found in vitro that insulin specifically inhibited the chemokine response to Group B Streptococcus and other bacteria by modulating NF-kB binding to chemokine genes via activation of PI3 K. Insulin concentrations in several tissues are higher than in plasma [10]. Therefore, it is conceivable that high tissue insulin concentrations achieved by a constant increase in circulating insulin levels due to basal + premeal insulin therapy instead of premeal insulin alone therapy may interfere with polymorphonuclear leukocytes recruitment and affect tissue homeostasis [27]. The evaluation of CRP and WBC levels after surgery in the present study are in agreement with these insulin-induced molecular mechanisms () .Insulin therapy and hypoglycemiaThe basal + premeal insulin therapy is well tolerated with an acceptable rate of hypoglycemia. In this study, a glucose level &lt;70 mg/dl was reported in 14.88% of patients in the basal + premeal insulin group and in 4.05% in the premeal insulin alone therapy group (p &lt; 0.0001), without significant differences in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia. Similar results were reported during the Umpierrez et al. study[15], in which glucose levels &lt;70 mg/dl were reported in 23.1% of patients in the basal-bolus and in 4.7% in the sliding scale regular insulin therapy group without differences in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia. On the other hand, mild hypoglycemic episodes in the present study were 36% and 38% lower than those find in the Umpierrez at al [15] and in Bellido et al. [28] studies, respectively, underlying the importance of a strict collaboration between surgery and diabetologist teams.It is interesting to note that in both the Umpierrez et al. [15]. and in our study, the length of hospital stay was significantly decreased with basal + premeal insulin therapy. Moreover, in the present study, the length of hospital stay after surgery was 1.5 days less (decrease of 18%) than with premeal insulin alone therapy, providing a significant impact on public health costs. In agreement with these data, Greco et al. [29] found in a multicenter cohort study in 4316 cardiac surgery patients operated in 2010, although the presence of hyperglycemia (≥180 mg/dl) was associated with an additional cost of $3192, an additional length of hospital stay of 0.8 days and an increase in infections of 1.6%, this effect was counter-regulated by the insulin treatment in the presence of the same hyperglycemic levels (180 to 240 mg/dl). In fact, in these insulin-treated patients there was a cost reductions of $6225, a reduction of length of hospital stay of 1.6 days and a reduction of infections of 4.1%.Limitations/StrengthsThis study was limited by being a single-center retrospective observational nature and by the evaluation of an association between the use of basal insulin therapy and an improvement in postoperative infective complications. On the other hand, the strength of our study was to exclude patients with a clinically relevant history of hyperglycemic crises before admission. In fact, it is well known that diabetic subjects with higher HbA1c could have increased risk to develop postoperative infective complications and the intensive insulin therapy during the post surgery period reduced these risks. These data were elegantly presented by ref 6 e ref 30 et al. and this argument would also beyond the scope of the study. Therefore, we only studied individuals who needed insulin therapy from the onset of elevated blood glucose levels during cardiac surgery. Thus, we were able to evaluate the effect of basal insulin per se on postoperative infective complications and could exclude a possible legacy hyperglycemic effect on post-surgery outcomes [6], [30]. This exclusion criterion might explain the almost normal HbA1c levels before surgery in both groups of subjects. In a previous study we found that in subjects submitted to cardiac surgery, before the surgery intervention the presence of impaired glucose tolerance or new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was present in 56% of subjects affected by mitral or aortic valve disease and in 67% of subjects affected by ischemic cardiac disease [31]. This data are in agreement with previous epidemiological studies on patients affected by valve disease in which the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was at least doubled as compared to the general population aged between 20 and 79 years (10.9% vs. 5.5% in Canada and 13.4% vs. 7.9% in USA) [32], [33], [34] and with our previous studies on non-diabetic subjects affected by ischemic heart disease undergoing coronary stenting [35]. This high percentage of alterations in glucose metabolism in these subjects well explains how we selected almost 50% of subject hospitalized during this period and underlines the potential clinical relevance of the study. On the other hands, it is important to underline that nearly 90% of the patients in the study did not have diabetes and this should impact interpretation and application of the results. For instance data from the gLUCO-CABG study indicates that patients without DM may do better at lower BG targets than patients with DM [36].ConclusionIn conclusion, the basal + premeal insulin regimen is associated with a reduced frequency of postoperative infective complications than the premeal insulin alone therapy, without increasing the number of severe hypoglycemic events. Therefore, these results suggest, for the first time, a beneficial effect of basal insulin therapy on post-surgery outcome independent of circulating glucose levels. Moreover, the present study suggests that the basal + premeal insulin regimen could be preferred over pre-meal insulin alone treatment in cardiac surgery patients requiring continuous intravenous insulin infusion for an acute increase in circulating glucose levels during the cardiac surgery period. However, although the present study included a relatively large number of subjects, a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial on the effect of insulin per se, independent of glycemic control, on composite hospital infective complications in cardiac surgery setting is certainly needed.FundingsNo funding was obtained.Disclosure statementsThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Author contributionsPMP and LDM share equal contribution in the design of the study.

"Metabolic Culprits in Obese Pregnancies and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Big Babies, Big Twists, Big Picture","AbstractPregnancy has been equated to a ""stress test"" in which placental hormones and growth factors expose a mother's predisposition toward metabolic disease, unleashing her previously occult insulin resistance (IR), mild β-cell dysfunction, and glucose and lipid surplus due to the formidable forces of pregnancy-induced IR. Although pregnancy-induced IR is intended to assure adequate nutrition to the fetus and placenta, in mothers with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or those who develop gestational diabetes mellitus, this overnutrition to the fetus carries a lifetime risk for increased metabolic disease. Norbert Freinkel, nearly 40 years ago, coined this excess intrauterine nutrient exposure and subsequent offspring developmental risk ""fuel-mediated teratogenesis,"" not limited to only excess maternal glucose. Our attempts to better elucidate the causes and mechanisms behind this double-edged IR of pregnancy, to metabolically characterize the intrauterine environment that results in changes in newborn body composition and later childhood obesity risk, and to examine potential therapeutic approaches that might target maternal metabolism are the focus of this article. Rapidly advancing technologies in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics offer us innovative approaches to interrogate these metabolic processes in the mother, her microbiome, the placenta, and her offspring that contribute to a phenotype at risk for future metabolic disease. If we are successful in our efforts, the researcher, endocrinologist, obstetrician, and health care provider fortunate enough to care for pregnant women have the unique opportunity to positively impact health outcomes not only in the short term but in the long run, not just in one life but in two—and possibly, for the next generation.IntroductionThe power of pregnancy offers the clinician and scientist a unique opportunity to meaningfully affect the outcome of two individuals. Applying observations from the immense field of medicine to optimize the outcome of both mother and her infant, humbled by a placenta that will ultimately determine the exposure to the fetus, is an extraordinary challenge and opportunity. Trained as an internist and inspired by two professors of medicine who were both pioneers in obstetric medicine, I spent my first 12 years pursuing clinical research in thromboembolism in pregnancy, the leading case of maternal mortality at the time. The first major twist along my career path was made possible by two professors of endocrinology who led me to appreciate the profound endocrinologic changes remodeling maternal physiology into an insulin-resistant (IR) state. This transformation of maternal metabolism and its effect on pregnancies complicated by obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) became my research focus over the next 18 years and is the subject of this article.This IR state, not only characterized by hyperglycemia, unearths the already present propensity for mothers to develop metabolic disease and may also promote the future development of metabolic disease in her offspring (1,2). In fact, it was indeed an endocrinologist, Norbert Freinkel, who delivered his seminal 1980 Banting lecture (3) the year I started medical school, ""Of Pregnancy and Progeny,"" who is a founding father of the fetal overnutrition hypothesis. In essence, Dr. Freinkel transformed our thinking about the intrauterine environment in mothers with diabetes, overnutrition, and obesity and the future health implications to the offspring. His described that ""fuel-mediated teratogenesis""—not limited to only maternal glucose but inclusive of maternal lipids and amino acids—could lead to ""alterations occurring subsequent to organogenesis during the differentiation and proliferation of fetal cells,"" which ""could cause long-range effects upon behavioral, anthropometric, and metabolic functions"" (3). The work that follows is a direct result of many inspirational collaborators, especially Drs. Jacob (Jed) Friedman and Teresa (Teri) Hernandez (University of Colorado School of Medicine), aiming to shed additional insights on the 1) causes and mechanisms that underlie the IR of normal pregnancy, obesity, and GDM; 2) metabolic characterization of the intrauterine metabolic environment that contributes to excess infant adiposity; and 3) potential targets and timing of pregnancy interventions to promote healthy short- and long-term outcomes for both mother and child.Lessons Learned on IR From a Mouse With Too Much Placental Growth HormoneEndocrinologists spend much of their clinical time attempting to attenuate IR in their patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or diabetes. Yet, in the context of pregnancy, IR is a critical normal pathophysiologic mechanism to ensure adequate nutrient substrate provision from mother to a growing fetus (4). Unfortunately, when IR in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, or liver and/or some degree of compromised β-cell reserve predates the pregnancy, often seen in women with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and in women who develop GDM, the increasing IR demands of normal pregnancy place further burden on the maternal β-cell to step up secretion. The inability to meet this demand results in excess glucose, lipid, and amino acid exposure to the fetal-placental unit (5,6). This often leads to fetal hyperinsulinemia, which can occur by 16 weeks' gestation, enhanced fetal growth, and an overabundance of maternal substrate for excess fetal fat accretion (7).Textbooks have told us that human placental lactogen (hPL) was the primary cause of this physiologic IR of pregnancy. Yet the data supporting this causation were limited as hPL has both insulin and anti-insulin effects and may actually be more important to stimulate the growth of maternal pancreatic islets and increase lipolysis and free fatty acid (FFA) liberation from adipocytes as an energy substrate (8). The placenta also makes a growth hormone (GH) variant, similar to pituitary GH, that has been known to increase IR in pathologic states such as acromegaly (8). Human placental growth hormone (hPGH) is a product of the human GH variant gene that differs from pituitary GH by 13 amino acids. Its secretion is tonic, increases six- to eightfold throughout gestation, and virtually replaces pituitary GH in the maternal circulation by ∼20 weeks (8,9). We set out to prove whether hPGH, never before characterized by its effect on insulin action, also had the capacity to cause IR. Dr. Andrzej Bartke (Southern Illinois University School of Medicine) was generous to share a transgenic mouse that expressed hPGH at levels similar to the third trimester of pregnancy. Simple glucose tolerance testing revealed that fasting insulin levels were ∼4 times higher than in control mice and ∼7 times higher 30 min after glucose stimulation, confirming pronounced IR. We further showed a marked decrease in insulin sensitivity given that an insulin injection into these hPGH transgenic mice resulted in no significant decline in glucose disposal compared with wild-type mice, who demonstrated &gt;65% decline in glucose levels (10).How hPGH caused IR at a cellular level was our next puzzle. By focusing on the skeletal muscle of these transgenic hPGH mice, we discovered an unforeseen twist that hPGH selectively increased the expression of the p85 regulatory unit of phosphatidlylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), a key effector enzyme necessary for stimulating glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues. In a series of subsequent experiments, the seemingly paradoxical finding of an increase in a subunit of PI 3-kinase being associated with IR was ultimately solved. PI 3-kinase is composed of both a p85 regulatory unit and a catalytic subunit (p110), which must form a p85-p110 heterodimer and bind to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) for PI 3-kinase activation to occur. When the p85 monomer is selectively overexpressed by the action of hPGH, it competes with the active p85-p110 heterodimer in a dominant negative fashion for binding to IRS-1, resulting in a decrease in IRS-1–associated PI 3-kinase activity. We confirmed that this decrease in PI 3-kinase activity resulted in the final step of the insulin signaling pathway being attenuated—a reduction in GLUT-4 translocation to the plasma membrane (11) (Fig. 1). Further, the excess GH-induced IR was completely reversible using a GH-releasing antagonist (12).Figure 1 Simple schematic of the proximal insulin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle of normal pregnancy and GDM. Insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation (P) of the insulin receptor (IR), defective in GDM, which activates the insulin receptor to dock IRS-1. After IRS-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine domains, it triggers the recruitment of PI 3-kinase, a critical enzyme for glucose transport into the cell. GDM women also have decreased tyrosine activation of IRS-1 and reduced IRS-1, in part due to increased serine phosphorylation that increases the degradation of IRS-1 and dampens the insulin signal. The increase in basal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation does not resolve in GDM women who show persistent glucose intolerance postpartum and are at highest risk for type 2 diabetes. PI 3-kinase is composed of a regulatory subunit (p85α) and a catalytic subunit (p110) that must form a heterodimer for PI 3-kinase activation to occur. When excess p85α monomers are stimulated by hPGH in normal pregnancy, it competes with the p85-p110 heterodimer for binding to IRS-1, thereby causing a decrease in the IRS-1–associated PI 3-kinase activity and reduction in GLUT-4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Elevated p85 reverses postpartum with the disappearance of hPGH.Insulin Signaling Changes in Skeletal Muscle in Pregnant and Postpartum Women With Obesity or GDMAlthough hPGH mediated the IR in mice that expressed this placental hormone at levels similar to the third trimester of human pregnancy, ascribing this mechanism to the IR in human pregnancy was still a leap. To translate these findings to human pregnancy, we designed a longitudinal study in which we collected four vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from pregnant women who were overweight/obese with BMI-matched diet-controlled GDM mothers before and after a glucose load at ∼30–32 weeks gestation and again at 9–10 weeks postpartum. Our intent was to also decipher the dynamic insulin signaling changes in GDM mothers who continued to display impaired glucose tolerance postpartum. Not surprisingly, recruitment for these studies, which involved fasting and insulin-stimulated muscle biopsies in pregnant women both antepartum and postpartum, was painfully slow. However, after ∼7 years, our prospective study demonstrated that reduced ability of insulin to phosphorylate the insulin receptor and increased levels of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, similar to our mice, were reversible after delivery, as might be expected given the disappearance of hPGH after pregnancy. However, mothers with GDM also had a decrease in IRS-1 and changes in tyrosine and serine phosphorylation compared with BMI-matched control subjects (13), further dampening signaling. Importantly, some women with GDM had been shown to have a persistent insulin signaling defect with increased skeletal muscle tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) up to 1 year postpartum (14). We also established that GDM women demonstrate impaired IRS-1 signaling–associated increased serine kinase activation, which persisted in women who did not normalize their glucose tolerance postpartum (15) (Fig. 1).Although we hoped that the physiological changes in hPGH in pregnancy would be a straightforward predictor of the degree of IR in pregnancy, McIntyre et al. (16) found hPGH not to be a simple biomarker of the multiple biologic processes that contribute to the overall IR of pregnancy and excess fetal growth, which also include leptin, adiponectin, TNF-α, and IGFBP1. Catalano and colleagues (17,18) have also shown a reduction in adiponectin and PPARγ in adipose tissue that is also associated with tissue-specific IR. While reducing excessive skeletal muscle or adipose IR in pregnancies complicated by GDM might be a viable target for attenuating IR, the mechanisms driving these changes likely have important roles in normal pregnancy. We anticipate that the insulin signaling defects we observed to persist in skeletal muscle of GDM women, in addition to observations by Boyle et al. (19) that AMPK and oxidative phosphorylation are dramatically reduced in the skeletal muscle of GDM women, might lead to specific targeted therapy or physical activity interventions for prevention of GDM and the development of type 2 diabetes postpartum.Why Do Women With Obesity Alone Give Birth to Big Babies?Obesity, which is often associated with IR, is now the leading cause of maternal morbidity and affects nearly 40% of women of child-bearing age (20). In fact, obesity alone accounts for a greater number of large-for-gestational age (LGA) infants than pregnancies complicated by preexisting diabetes or GDM (6,21,22). Many studies have reported strong associations between intrauterine exposure to maternal obesity, excess adiposity at birth, and offspring development of obesity in childhood (2). Fasting, 1-h, and 2-h glucose on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, lower than previously considered as GDM, were correlated with LGA in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study (23) and were recently shown to correlate with glucose intolerance in the 10- to 14-year-old offspring (24). However, Catalano et al. (25) demonstrated in a cohort of 89 offspring from mothers who were normoglycemic or who had GDM that childhood adiposity at 9 years correlated much more strongly with maternal obesity than did GDM, with an OR of ∼5.5. In addition to maternal prepregnancy BMI, the degree of gestational weight gain (GWG) also contributes to excess fetal growth, although overall less so than prepregnancy BMI in our review of the literature (26). The association with excess GWG and adiposity at birth appeared strongest in overweight mothers who gained excessive weight compared with mothers with obesity who gave birth to infants with the highest mean fat mass, regardless of GWG.We hypothesized that given the strong contribution of maternal obesity alone to excess fetal growth independent of GDM (27), women with obesity may have higher fasting and postprandial glucoses than women who are normal weight (NW), although not high enough to meet criteria for GDM. In an extensive review done with Dr. Teri Hernandez of glycemia patterns in normal pregnancy (28), we determined that mean fasting glucose level in NW mothers was 71 mg/dL, 1-h postprandial value was 109 mg/dL, and the 2-h postprandial value was 99 mg/dL with a 24-h mean glucose of 88 mg/dL, all much lower than current therapeutic targets (gestational age 34 ± 2 weeks). In a prospective study, spearheaded by two endocrine fellows, in which we controlled maternal diet while wearing continuous glucose monitors (CGM), women with obesity were shown to have ∼8% higher 24-h glycemic profiles compared with NW control subjects (29). We also identified daytime, nocturnal, fasting, and postprandial glycemic profiles that were useful in characterizing fetal growth (30). In a second highly controlled longitudinal study in which NW mothers and those with obesity received controlled eucaloric diets, we documented mean fasting blood glucose values of ∼73 vs. ∼77 mg/dL at 28 weeks and mean 2-h postprandial glucose values of 87 vs. 96 mg/dL in our NW and obese groups of women, respectively (31). Furthermore, the fasting and repeated measures of postprandial glucose over 4 h both early (∼16 weeks) and later (∼28 weeks) in pregnancy were also ∼10% higher in the mothers with obesity. Women with obesity had larger increases in their 24-h glucose profiles and daytime, nocturnal, and postprandial glucose profiles from early to later pregnancy compared with NW mothers (all P &lt; 0.05) when studied on a eucaloric controlled diet (32). In the women with obesity, the postprandial glucose exposure over three meals early in pregnancy was predictive of newborn percent fat mass (NB %fat), and later in pregnancy, the entire 24-h glucose profiles were predictive in women with obesity (all P &lt; 0.05) but not in NW women (32). This subclinical pattern of mild hyperglycemia, which remains occult and untreated, may in part explain why the prevalence of LGA and macrosomia is higher in women with obesity (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, recent data by a postdoctoral fellow in our group demonstrated that women with obesity who have mild sleep disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index &gt;5) have higher 24-h glucose profiles when on a fixed diet than women without obesity. This suggests that mild sleep apnea, common in women with obesity, may be one of the contributors to elevated 24-h glycemic profiles that could be targeted for treatment (33).Figure 2 Data from controlled breakfast meal studies showing the 4-h area under the curve of plasma glucose (A), insulin (B), and TGs (C) in NW women vs. women with obesity (OB) early (12–14 weeks) and later (26–28 weeks) in pregnancy and the 4-h area under the curve of plasma glucose (D), insulin (E), and TGs (F) in NW, OB, and diet-controlled GDM at 28–30 weeks.In addition to higher glucose levels, our data also showed that fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations, as well as IR estimated by HOMA-IR, are 50–60% higher in women with obesity both early (∼16 weeks) and later in pregnancy (28 weeks) as compared with NW women receiving a fixed diet (31) (Fig. 2B). The higher degree of IR in women with obesity that predates the pregnancy, as shown by Catalano et al. (34) with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies, is clearly present early and worsens later in pregnancy. This additional maternal IR, superimposed on the IR of normal pregnancy, may serve to increase the availability of all nutrients (including lipids and amino acids) to the fetal-placental unit, resulting in excess fetal growth in women with obesity (Fig. 3).Figure 3 Diagrammatic portrayal of the effects of overnutrition on offspring in pregnancies complicated by obesity, metabolic syndrome, or GDM and the potential life-cycle consequences. A woman becomes pregnant with variable degrees of preexisting metabolic dysfunction; her metabolism is furthered altered by the IR of pregnancy mediated by placental factors. Maternal IR in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver along with dietary nutrient excess results in excess glucose (G), amino acid (AA), FFA, and inflammatory cytokine exposure to the placenta. Placental angiogenesis and the transcriptome are influenced by maternal factors and the sex of the fetus, which determine nutrient sensing, metabolism, transport, and ultimate nutrient exposure to the fetus. The fetus responds to excess glucose and AAs with fetal hyperinsulinemia, a potent growth factor, which also promotes organomegaly, adipogenesis, and lipid storage in subcutaneous (SubQ) and hepatic tissue. Intrauterine overnutrition affects stem cell differentiation, mitochondrial function, and appetite regulation in the offspring, and the maternal microbiome is transmitted at delivery. Postnatal factors such as mode of feeding and rapid weight (Wt) gain along with other early life exposures further promote the development of childhood metabolic disease. The daughter becomes a mother and the cycle perpetuates.

Another unexpected twist in our earlier CGM data (29), during which women with obesity on a controlled diet demonstrated higher 24-h glycemic profiles, was that a single fasting TG measured once at ∼14–16 weeks in pregnancy correlated more strongly with NB %fat by skinfolds than any of the glycemic profiles by CGM. The placenta has lipase activity, and the tireless efforts of another postdoctoral fellow demonstrated that the activity of placental lipoprotein lipase, important in hydrolyzing maternal TGs to FFAs that can be transported across the placenta, is highly correlated with NB %fat by skinfolds at birth (r = 0.59; P = 0.006) and even more so when corrected for gestational age at delivery (r = 0.75; P = 0.0001) (40).Although a number of studies have shown that fasting TGs and FFAs contribute to fetal fat accretion, prospective studies in which maternal diet was controlled and which also examined postprandial FFAs and postprandial TGs were lacking (35). In our prospective study that characterized the maternal metabolic environment in mothers who were NW or obese both early (∼16 weeks) and later in pregnancy (28 weeks), we demonstrated that maternal TGs both fasting and postprandially after a controlled diet were a stronger predictor of NB %fat than any of our glucose or insulin measures (31). Fasting TGs and postprandial TGs both at 1 h and 2 h were already ∼30–40% higher in mothers with obesity early in pregnancy compared with NW and also 30–40% higher at 28 weeks (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, in NW women, it was the increase in TGs from early to later in pregnancy that correlated strongest with NB %fat (r = 0.57; P &lt; 0.01) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, in mothers with obesity, it was 16-week fasting TGs (r = 0.60; P = 0.006) and 1-h or 2-h postprandial TGs (r = 0.69–0.71; P &lt; 0.01) in early pregnancy that most strongly correlated with NB %fat, contributed by both VLDL-TG and chylomicron TG (CM-TG) (31). TGs are modestly higher in mothers with GDM compared with mothers with obesity (Fig. 2E), and these data, in addition to others, suggest that maternal TGs are a largely unrecognized substrate for fetal fat accretion, especially in mothers with obesity (31). A larger community-based trial in a free-living environment to confirm the contribution and better characterize the relationship of fasting and postprandial TGs to infant adiposity is the focus of a proposed future trial in women who are overweight or obese.Can We Intervene With Diet? Challenging the Conventional Lower Carbohydrate Diet in GDMEfforts at deciphering the optimal diet for pregnant women have been largely limited to women with GDM given that diet therapy is the first-line therapy and mainstay of treatment. Conventionally, the ""GDM diet"" was one that limited carbohydrates in an attempt to attenuate the postprandial glycemic response (41). However, many mothers substitute fat for carbohydrate (42,43), which may have unintentional consequences of increasing FFAs, which are a strong contributor to worsening maternal IR, promoting further shunting of all excess nutrients to the growing fetus (Fig. 3). Given the lack of rigorous data supporting the use of one macronutrient over the other, the American Diabetes Association abandoned specific diet recommendations for mothers with GDM in 2005 (44) other than ensuring that women receive, at the minimum, 175 g of carbohydrate/day in the second and third trimester. This amount is critical for meeting the energy demands of the placenta and fetus, of which 80% are dependent on glucose.My research colleague, Dr. Teri Hernandez, as a former cardiac nurse, was extremely disconcerted about the potential for a low-carbohydrate, higher-fat diet to have unintended consequences and potentially worsen maternal IR, inflammation and actually promote excess fetal fat accretion. We reconstructed the highly quoted ∼40% carbohydrate/45% fat/15% protein conventional diet described by Jovanovic-Peterson and Peterson (41) and developed a ""challenge"" diet precisely matched in calories and types of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins that only differed in the macronutrient percentages (45). This diet, later termed the CHOICE diet (Choosing Healthy Options in Carbohydrate Energy), substituted 20% of the calories from fat with higher-quality, more complex carbohydrates such that the macronutrient composition was instead 60% carbohydrate/25% fat/15% protein. Both diets were matched for types of fats and &lt;18% of total calories from both diets were from simple sugars. Importantly, given that current literature lacks randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing diets in which all meals are provided, critical in minimizing overlap between the diets, our design provided all meals to the mothers at the time of GDM diagnosis through the remainder of pregnancy. Data from a randomized controlled crossover trial demonstrated that the higher–complex carbohydrate/lower-fat CHOICE diet achieved similar glycemic profiles using CGM (6% higher on CHOICE) and that the mean 1-h (115 mg/dL) and 2-h (106 mg/dL) postprandial glucoses were still well below the targets for GDM (45). The FFAs were significantly lower postprandially on the CHOICE diet. In a follow-up pilot study in which glucose, insulin, FFAs, adipose tissue lipolysis, and NB %fat were measured after the mothers had been randomized to one of the diets for 6–7 weeks, we found that the fasting blood glucose was actually lower on the CHOICE diet (P = 0.03). Furthermore, insulin suppression of lipolysis in maternal adipose tissue biopsies was better on the CHOICE diet, corresponding to lower expression of multiple adipose tissue proinflammatory genes (46). Importantly, NB %fat trended lower on the CHOICE higher–complex carbohydrate/low-fat diet in a limited pilot sample of 12 mother/offspring dyads. The findings are consistent with other RCTs where meals were not provided but also support that diets lower in glycemic index, low in saturated fat, and higher in fiber appear to attenuate excess fetal growth (43,47). The final data from the CHOICE RCT powered for a diet difference in NB %fat as the primary outcome should be available within the next year.The Significance and Challenge in Measuring Body Composition in Babies and InfantsBirth weight is an imperfect proxy for increased infant fat mass given that it includes both lean mass and fat mass. In the cohort of 89 offspring of mothers with normal glucose tolerance or GDM in the study by Catalano et al. (25), increased adiposity at birth (but not birth weight) was correlated to adiposity at 6 to 11 years of age by DXA. Adiposity at birth and during the first 2 years of life when infants triple their fat mass is an important predictor for future obesity risk and metabolic syndrome, much more than birth weight alone. DXA and air displacement plethysmography (PEAPOD) are considered methods with more precision and reproducibility than skinfold measures or bioelectrical impedance analysis and less expensive than MRI techniques (48,49). However, DXA requires infants to be still and exposes them to a very low background level of radiation—a misinterpretation (and unfortunate twist) that halted our recruitment for nearly 1 year. Regrettably, most infants can no longer fit into a PEAPOD by 6 months of life. Given the shortcomings of these different methods and the need to accurately measure fat and fat-free mass throughout infancy, we prospectively measured NB %fat in term infants using DXA, PEAPOD, and skinfolds at ∼10–14 days of life (all three measures taken on same day) and again at ∼1 year of life by DXA and skinfolds. We evaluated two different Hologic software versions for DXA along with PEAPOD and skinfolds and determined how well they correlated with each other and, more importantly, their degree of agreement (48).Consistent with our track record of surprising twists, we found that although the Pearson correlations between the our original DXA software version (DXA1) with the newer software version (DXA2) in newborns were strong (r = 0.89), as with DXA1 and PEAPOD (r = 0.74) and with DXA1 and skinfold estimates (r = 0.69), the actual agreement between DXA1 and the other methods was much less impressive (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.53 with DXA2; 0.62 for PEAPOD and also 0.62 for skinfolds). By 1 year of age, although the correlation between the two DXA software versions was identical to that seen in the newborn (r = 0.89), the agreement was poor (ICC 0.20). The correlation between DXA1 and skinfolds at 1 year was poor (r = 0.50), and the agreement was even worse (ICC 0.11) (48). Unfortunately, these data demonstrate that while DXA, PEAPOD, and skinfolds are highly correlated at birth, the agreement is less impressive such that the methodologies cannot be substituted for each other when following offspring longitudinally. Further, at 1 year of life, both the correlation and the agreement with DXA and skinfolds are very poor, with DXA estimating NB %fat at about ∼3 times higher than by skinfolds in our study. These data support that the same methodology should be used in longitudinal studies. This is problematic given that MRI is expensive and, like DXA, it is difficult to restrict infant and toddler movement, infants will outgrow the PEAPOD after 6 months, and toddler PEAPOD (TODPOD) measures are less available and challenging.Another limitation of DXA, PEAPOD, bioelectrical impedance analysis, or skinfolds is that they do not measure liver or visceral fat, likely a more important estimate of metabolic risk (48). Only MRI spectroscopy is able to measure visceral or liver fat, which is expensive and requires that the infant or child lie still. A pediatric gastroenterologist colleague helped to design methodology, with the assistance of radiology experts, to estimate the liver fat in the newborn offspring from a cohort of GDM mothers who were obese compared with newborns from mothers who were NW. It is very concerning that newborns from GDM mothers with obesity already had a 68% increase in intrahepatocellular lipid at ∼2 weeks of age (50), and recent pilot data support a strong relationship with fasting TGs and postprandial TGs at GDM diagnosis and newborn liver fat (51). Given the steadily increasing prevalence of childhood nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that progresses more rapidly to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in childhood, these findings and others in nonhuman primates by McCurdy et al. (52) strongly suggest that an intrauterine environment characterized by excess maternal fuels from obesity, diabetes, or a high-fat diet may result in TG accumulation in the fetal liver. This may be especially important if the exposure is early in pregnancy, before subcutaneous fat stores are developed, and could potentially serve as a ""first hit"" toward the development of NAFLD (53), which may affect up to 40% of children with obesity.Targeting Who, What, and When to Prevent Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes and Metabolic Disease in Mothers and OffspringWe and others have demonstrated that the metabolic heterogeneity in human pregnancy, simply based on maternal BMI or the presence or absence of a GDM diagnosis (also influenced by various criteria), is enormous (54). Not all women with normal BMI are insulin sensitive, not all women with a BMI in the obese range are IR (6), and women with ""GDM"" have highly variable degrees of skeletal muscle, adipose, and hepatic IR predating the pregnancy in addition to the normal IR of pregnancy (4). Further, GDM women have differing degrees of β-cell defects that also predate the pregnancy and some can mount markedly high insulin responses and others cannot (5,6,54) (Fig. 1). Lipid metabolism in pregnancy is also highly variable, partly related to the estrogen-induced influence of VLDL production in pregnancy and CM-TG in the diet, superimposed on the degree of maternal adipose tissue IR (31,39). The degree to which TGs and FFAs may contribute to fetal fat accretion has yet to be fully elucidated, but observations that maternal glucose does not solely explain fetal overgrowth support its future investigation as a therapeutic target.New technologies and advancements have informed us how maternal diet, maternal body composition, and the maternal response to placental hormones and growth factors, in the context of the mother's own metagenomics and metagenomics of her microbiome, can influence her IR and inflammatory state, β-cell responses, and the levels of glucose, amino acids, and lipids she exposes to the fetal-placental unit (55) (Fig. 3). The placenta is the ultimate gatekeeper to what crosses into the fetal circulation and is affected by placental angiogenesis, its own transcriptome that will influence placental hormone and growth factor production, metabolism, nutrient sensing and transporters, as well as the sex of the placenta (56–58) (Fig. 3). Clearly the timing of these exposures to the fetal-placental unit, very early or later in pregnancy, has immense fetal programming implications (7,59,60). Indeed, most lifestyle interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes at midpregnancy have been largely disappointing (59). How the fetus responds to excess nutrient exposure and growth factors as a result of timing in pregnancy and its own metagenomics will affect its β-cell response, immune and metabolic responses, and fetal fat accretion in subcutaneous versus visceral stores, as well as stem cell differentiation into adipocytes or myocytes (Fig. 3). Notably, Boyle et al. (61) have recently shown that the adipogenic potential of offspring umbilical mesenchymal stem cells is higher in mothers with obesity. Furthermore, Baker et al. (62) demonstrated that metabolic changes in these adipocytes were predictive of adiposity gain in the first 5 months of life. As described cogently by my colleague Dr. Jed Friedman (1), the peripartum and postnatal environment will continue to have a critical effect on childhood developmental programming, partially driven by genetic and epigenetic factors that are influenced by mode of delivery, the transmission of the maternal microbiome (63), feeding practices, antibiotic use, and other environmental exposures and metabolic disruptors (64), the subject of intense investigation in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Environmental influences on Child Outcomes (ECHO) program (65). Dr. Freinkel (3) set the stage for us to consider far more than simply maternal glucose as the determinant of maternal outcomes, fetal growth, and future maternal and offspring metabolic risk. Technologic advancements in metagenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome have brought previously unimaginable new lenses to our understanding and have humbled what we thought we understood.Our current ability to identify pregnancies ""at risk"" for maternal and offspring short- and long-term adverse outcomes by using only maternal BMI, GWG, or differing diagnostic criteria to draw the line between GDM and no GDM is, unarguably, limited. ""Risk engines"" (60) that better identify high-risk maternal genetics, new maternal metabolic biomarkers, and that utilize more accurate indicators of diet and lifestyle practices may dramatically alter our definition of at-risk mothers. Personalized medicine may be critical in targeting interventions that are much more likely to be successful during prepregnancy or early gestation that implement personalized nutrition (likely influenced by the microbiome), supplements or prebiotics, and activity prescriptions—all based on nutrigenomics and metabolomics. When it is necessary to prescribe medications, careful consideration of their pharmacokinetic properties (which may differ by the mother's pharmacogenomics), how best to individualize their use to target specific metabolic abnormalities, and evaluation of their potential long-term programming effects for those that cross the placenta argue against a one-size-fits-all interventional approach (66). One thing is clear: our current definition of at-risk women simply based on maternal glucose requires modification, our targeted interventions need to be individualized and occur early, and our efforts cannot be halted at the time of delivery. The challenges are formidable, but the potential for meaningfully impactful consequences on maternal and offspring metabolic health call out loudly to future investigators with new toolboxes and perspectives.Article InformationAcknowledgments.

Effect of serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D3 on insulin resistance and β‐cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients,"Introduction Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is a risk factor in the development of diabetes1. Among many non‐calcemic functions, vitamin D acts as a necessary cofactor for insulin secretion2. The main circulating form of vitamin D, 25‐hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), is considered to be the best indicator of vitamin D status3. The 25(OH)D3 concentration was lower in individuals with type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance than in those with normal glucose tolerance4. Abnormal glucose tolerance has been reported to adversely affect insulin sensitivity and β‐cell function5, and the loss of β‐cell function and insulin sensitivity is known to contribute to the development of diabetes6. Therefore, vitamin D, measured as 25(OH)D3, might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes7. The mechanisms whereby low 25(OH)D3 concentrations increase the risk of type 2 diabetes are still not well understood; the association of low serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations with type 2 diabetes might be mediated through glucose homeostasis effects. In particular, a direct effect of vitamin D on glucose homeostasis is insulin resistance and/or β‐cell dysfunction, the main pathophysiological disorders underlying type 2 diabetes8. Several studies have suggested that low vitamin D status contributed to insulin resistance9 and was associated with markers of impaired glucose metabolism, such as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)10. Vitamin D could play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by affecting insulin resistance, β‐cell function, or both11; there is a direct role for 25(OH)D, the major circulating metabolite precursor of the hormonally active form (25(OH)D3), in pancreatic β‐cell function and insulin sensitivity12. Cross‐sectional studies have reported that 25(OH)D is associated with insulin resistance and β‐cell function in healthy, glucose‐tolerant subjects11, and in subjects who are at risk for type 2 diabetes9. However, the effect of serum 25(OH)D3 level on insulin resistance and β‐cell function has not been well documented in diabetes patients. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of β‐cell function (HOMA‐β) and insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) from basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations is a widely used clinical and epidemiologic tool13 that, however, only shows what is occurring with glucose homeostasis in the fasting state14. Vitamin D is well known to play a role in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes, and a high vitamin D status provides protection against type 2 diabetes15. However, the exact mechanisms through which vitamin D affects diabetes development and progression are not yet fully understood, and the interaction of 25(OH)D3 with insulin resistance and β‐cell function has not been explored in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. Therefore, to further elucidate the role of vitamin D, measured as 25(OH)D3, on the potential mechanisms of type 2 diabetes development, the present study was designed to examine the correlation of 25(OH)D3 with insulin resistance and β‐cell function in a cohort of Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, with the combined use of HOMA and early‐phase insulin secretion index (ΔI30/ΔG30), as well as area under the insulin curve. Materials and Methods Patients We prospectively evaluated 97 consecutive patients admitted to the Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital between April and July 2008. The patients included 57 men and 40 women, aged 33–70 years (median age 52 ± 10 years), who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus according to the World Health Organization criteria from 199916. All patients underwent careful clinical examination to exclude the presence of acute diabetic complications, cancer or any other complications that could influence the calcium phosphorus metabolism. Patients who reported stress (trauma, surgery or mental stimulation) within the past 3 months, who had a severe infection, chronic renal disease or alcohol use, or who were taking any antidiabetic medications or other medicine (vitamin, mineral supplements or glucocorticoids) that could influence vitamin D metabolism were also excluded from the present study. The 69 sex‐ and age‐matched healthy controls (40 men, 29 women; age 33–70 years, mean 50 ± 11 years) were recruited into this study undergoing oral glucose tolerance test and physical examination during the same period. Smoking, chronic alcoholism, past or present drug intake, abnormal blood glucose level (&gt;140 mg/dL) and any medical conditions that could influence the calcium phosphorus metabolism constituted the exclusion criteria. The study was approved by the institutional review board for human subjects of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before participating in the study. Variable Assessment Data on baseline characteristics, including height, body mass, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic pressure and diastolic pressure, were measured after overnight fasting at the time of enrolment. Fasting venous blood samples were collected to measure the concentration of HbA1c, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), insulin and serum 25(OH)D3. HbA1c values were measured with the Bio‐Rad glycosylated hemoglobin column assay (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Blood glucose was measured by a glucose oxidase method using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV751GD; Shanghai Analytical Instrument Co., Shanghai, China). Insulin concentrations were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Total cholesterol, HDL‐C, LDL‐C and triglyceride levels were determined from the blood specimen collected after an overnight fast, and measured on the Olympus AU 5400/AU2700 autoanalyzer (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan). The 25(OH)D3 serum levels were measured by high‐pressure liquid chromatography (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) using an Aichrombond‐AQ C18 column (250 × 4 mm, 5 μm; Agilent, Los Angeles, CA, USA), as previously described17. The standard 25(OH)D3 was purchased from Dr Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany). The calibration curve was linear over the 0.5–120‐ng/mL range (r = 0.9993). The extraction recoveries of 25(OH)D3 ranged from 81.7 to 87.9%, and the inter‐ and intraday relative standard deviations were &lt;7.7 and &lt;9.9%, respectively. Serum levels of blood glucose and insulin were also determined at 0.5 and 2 h after the oral administration of 75 g glucose. Assessment of Insulin Resistance and β‐Cell Function The β‐cell function was estimated by HOMA‐β, early‐phase insulin secretion index (ΔI30/ΔG30) and area under the insulin curve (AUCins); insulin resistance was estimated using HOMA‐IR. HOMA‐β and HOMA‐IR were calculated using the following formulas: β‐cell function (%) = 20 × insulin / (glucose – 3.5); and insulin resistance = fasting serum insulin (μU/mL) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) / 22.5, respectively13. The total glucose response and insulin secretion were measured by the areas under the glucose concentration curve (AUCglu) and AUCins, and AUC was calculated by the trapezoidal method. The early‐phase insulin secretion index was calculated according to the ratio of insulin change to glucose change during the first 30 min after a meal (ΔI30/ΔG30). Deficiency of 25(OH)D3 was defined as a 25(OH)D3 concentration &lt;37.5 nmol/L18. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were expressed as the mean value ± standard deviation. Measurement data with a normal distribution between the groups were compared using an independent sample t‐test or one‐way analysis of variance (anova) as appropriate. Enumeration data with a normal distribution between groups were compared with a χ2‐test. Data with a non‐normal distribution were analyzed after a logarithmic transformation or square root transformation. The correlation between 25(OH)D3 and HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 or AUCins was calculated using Pearson's correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression analysis. A P‐value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Serum 25(OH)D3 Levels Between Diabetic and Control Group In total, 166 participants were enrolled as previously described in the inclusion criteria of the present study, and there was no significant difference in age and sex distribution between the diabetic and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). The serum 25(OH)D3 levels were significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes (36 ± 19 nmol/L) compared with those of the healthy control group (80 ± 26 nmol/L; t = −13.00, P &lt; 0.01). The prevalence of 25(OH)D3 deficiency was 62.89% (61/97) in the diabetic group, which was significantly higher than that of the control group, in which no one was identified as being deficient of 25(OH)D3 (χ2 = 68.60, P &lt; 0.01). Comparison of Clinical Data Among the Different 25(OH)D3 Level Groups According to the distribution of 25(OH)D3 levels, patients in the diabetic group were further divided into two groups; that is, the 25(OH)D3 deficiency group and the non‐deficiency group, with a cut‐off value of 37.5 nmol/L7. Comparisons of the clinical data among the patients with or without hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3 and healthy controls are listed in Table 1. No significant difference in age and sex distributions, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, Ca2+ or serum level of phosphorus was found among the three groups. There were several statistically significant differences between the patients with and without hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3. The values of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, 0.5‐h blood glucose, 2‐h blood glucose, AUCglu and creatinine clearance rate were significantly higher in the hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3 group, whereas fasting insulin, 0.5‐ and 2‐h insulin, AUCins, HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30, HOMA‐IR and serum creatinine were comparatively lower (P &lt; 0.05) compared with patients without hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3. However, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C and HDL‐C, differences in AUCglu, AUCins, HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 and HOMA‐IR were found to be statistically insignificant between the groups (F = 1.65, P &gt; 0.05). No significant difference in BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C or HDL‐C was observed between the groups. The serum 25(OH)D3 level in patients without hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3 was comparatively lower than that of the healthy control group (t = −5.60, P &lt; 0.01). Table 1.

Comparison of 25(OH)D3 Levels Among Patients With Different HbA1c Levels According to the distribution of the HbA1c levels, 97 diabetic patients were divided into three groups: (i) HbA1c levels &lt;8%; (ii) HbA1c levels 8–10%; and (iii) HbA1c levels ≥10%. The serum 25(OH)D3 levels in patients with HbA1c levels &lt;8% (44 ± 22 nmol/L) were significantly higher than those of patients with higher HbA1c levels (HbA1c levels 8–10% and HbA1c levels ≥10% for 28 ± 7 nmol/L and 30 ± 10 nmol/L, respectively; F = 16.67, P &lt; 0.01). The distributions of age and sex were found to be statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05). Correlation Analysis of Serum 25(OH)D3 Levels and Clinical Features The effects of 25(OH)D3 concentration on relevant clinical features of diabetes patients were investigated (Table 2). Univariate analysis showed negative correlations between the serum 25(OH)D3 level and concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, and HbA1c. However, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C and HbA1c, multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that only triglycerides (r = −0.15, t = −2.94, P &lt; 0.05) and HbA1c (r = −0.58, t = −3.98, P &lt; 0.05) were independently negatively correlated with serum 25(OH)D3 concentration.

Correlation Analysis of Serum 25(OH)D3 Levels and Insulin Resistance With HOMA‐IR as a dependent variable, other factors, including serum 25(OH)D3 levels, age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, and HbA1c as independent variables, multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the HOMA‐IR and serum 25(OH)D3 levels. Correlation Analysis of Serum 25(OH)D3 Levels and β‐Cell Function Multiple stepwise regression analysis included the HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins individually as dependent variables, and the serum 25(OH)D3 levels, age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, HbA1c, and HOMA‐IR as independent variables. The results showed that HOMA‐β was independently associated with HbA1c and HOMA‐IR (P &lt; 0.01; Table 3), whereas serum 25(OH)D3 level had no independent effect on HOMA‐β. Both ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins were associated with sex, HbA1c, serum 25(OH)D3 levels, and HOMA‐IR (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. Serum 25(OH)D3 level was independently positively correlated with ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins (Table 3). Table 3.

Correlation Analysis of Serum 25(OH)D3 Level and Clinical Features, Insulin Resistance, and β‐Cell Function Between Diabetic and Control Groups Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation between serum 25(OH)D3 level and waist‐to‐hip ratio, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, HbA1c, HOMA‐IR, HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30, AUCins, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance rate (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05; Table 4). However, by multiple stepwise regression analysis, only triglycerides (r = −0.19, t = −3.57, P &lt; 0.01), HbA1c (r = −0.52, t = −3.12, P &lt; 0.01) and ΔI30/ΔG30 (r = 0.16, t = 3.92, P &lt; 0.01) emerged as independent factors associated with serum 25(OH)D3 level in diabetic patients and the healthy control group.

Covariates considered were gender, age, body mass index, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C). Discussion The current data showed that serum 25(OH)D3 level was significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes compared with that of the healthy control group, and the prevalence of hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3 was 62.9% in the diabetic patients, corroborating the results of the previous studies, which showed that the baseline 25(OH)D3 concentration was lower in diabetes patients and was inversely associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes19, 20. The vitamin D status of &lt;50 nmol/L has been previously reported to double the risk of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after adjustment for clinical covariables21. In further support of this association, we observed, in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients with decreasing 25(OH)D3 concentration, increasing concentrations of HbA1c, blood glucose and AUCglu, with decreasing insulin levels, AUCins, HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 and HOMA‐IR. These differences were statistically insignificant after adjustment for clinical parameters, including age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C and HDL‐C (F = 1.65, P &gt; 0.05). However, hypovitaminosis D was positively associated with insulin resistance and negatively correlated with β‐cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes11. HbA1c, a global measure of glucose homeostasis, has also been reported to inversely associate with vitamin D status, as measured by serum 25(OH)D levels10, 21, 22. Elevated HbA1c levels might be considered for screening people with vitamin D insufficiency10. Abnormalities could be a result of changes in insulin secretion and sensitivity21, and potential mechanisms contributing to vitamin D regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity include enhanced insulin secretion and synthesis23, and reduced inflammatory processes that reduce the functional capacity of pancreatic β‐cells expressing the vitamin D receptor and the enzyme 1‐a hydroxylase24. HOMA is a widely used clinical and epidemiological tool for assessing β‐cell function and insulin resistance from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin concentrations25; when used appropriately, it can closely mirror the glucose clamp technique in the assessment of insulin sensitivity26. Therefore, HOMA was used to assess insulin resistance and β‐cell function. However, because HOMA was reported to only show what is occurring with glucose homeostasis in the fasting state14, AUCglu, ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins were also used in the present study. Ample evidence has suggested that vitamin D activity is essential for pancreatic β‐cell function, and a higher baseline vitamin D level independently predicted better β‐cell function in subjects who were at risk for type 2 diabetes27-29. Insulin resistance has also been reported to associate with vitamin D insufficiency30, and data on both associations in a single study have been reported. The concentration of 25(OH)D was found to be independently associated with both insulin sensitivity and β‐cell function among individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes9, 11, though another study showed that serum 25(OH)D was not associated with insulin resistance or β‐cell function in the Canadian Cree31. Such controversy might a result of the variability of the method used or ethnic differences. In the present study, our multiple stepwise regression analysis was carried out to investigate the association of 25(OH)D3 levels with the IR and β‐cell function. Our results showed no independent effect of serum 25(OH)D3 level on the insulin resistance index (HOMA‐IR) derived in the basal state, suggesting that serum 25(OH)D3 might not associate with basal or hepatic insulin sensitivity in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. β‐Cell function was determined using HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins. The results showed that there was no significant correlation between serum 25(OH)D3 and HOMA‐β, a marker of basal insulin secretion of pancreatic β‐cells, and the latter was found to be independently associated with HbA1c and HOMA‐IR, corroborating the previous results that insulin sensitivity and secretion are mutually related, and that HOMA‐β alone might not accurately assess β‐cell function32. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D affects β‐cells by increasing the insulin response to glucose stimulation and does not affect basal insulin secretion33. HOMA‐β can be considered one aspect of β‐cell function, with the ability to increase basal insulin secretion to meet the elevation of basal glycemia34. Therefore, a correlation analysis of serum 25(OH)D3 concentration and ΔI30/ΔG30 as well as AUCins was carried out. The results showed that serum 25(OH)D3 concentration was significantly positively correlated with ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins; serum 25(OH)D3 was also shown to correlate with sex, HbA1c and HOMA‐IR. These results showed that the serum 25(OH)D3 concentration was less correlated with the basal insulin resistance and basal β‐cell function, and was significantly correlated with glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion. Abnormal fat accumulation in the liver, muscle and pancreatic islets plays a crucial role in the development of both β‐cell dysfunction and insulin resistance35. Our findings showed that triacylglycerol emerged as an independent factor that is negatively associated with serum 25(OH)D3 level. A previous study by Liu et al.36 reported that vitamin D, as measured by plasma 25(OH)D, was inversely associated with plasma triacylglycerol in non‐diabetic adults after adjusting for age and sex, but these associations were no longer significant after further adjustment for BMI, waist circumference and current smoking status. Further study is, therefore, still required to clarify the correlation of serum 25(OH)D3 level and triglycerides, and the potential mechanism of their effects on β‐cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. The present study also had some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Most importantly, it was a cross‐sectional study; some parameters and confounding factors, including different, non‐standardized meals taken by our patients and the degree of proteinuria or preferable urinary albumin excretion, were not considered in the present study. Thus, we can only show the existence of a correlation, but not a causal nexus between hypovitaminosis D and glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. In addition, the present study was restricted to one site and took place in a relatively limited number of patients, indicating that interpretation of the results needs to be done with caution. A large cohort of prospective studies should be further carried out to establish the link between hypovitaminosis D and development of type 2 diabetes in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. In conclusion, the present findings support earlier results that showed a low serum 25(OH)D3 concentration in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism. Serum 25(OH)D3 concentration is not correlated with basal insulin resistance or basal β‐cell function, but is significantly positively correlated with glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion and β‐cell function.

Alteration of gut microbiota by a Westernized lifestyle and its correlation with insulin resistance in non‐diabetic Japanese men,"Introduction Japanese‐American people, while being of the same race as native Japanese people, lead a different lifestyle. Thus, they form an adequate population that can be used for investigating the effects of a Westernized lifestyle on the development of lifestyle‐related metabolic diseases among Japanese people. We undertook a medical survey targeting Japanese people, and their descendants, who emigrated to the USA (the Hawaii‐Los Angeles‐Hiroshima Study) since 19701. It was inferred that Japanese‐Americans with an American lifestyle in Hawaii or Los Angeles had a higher degree of insulin resistance2, 3, as well as a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome4-6 than native Japanese with a Japanese lifestyle in Hiroshima. Recently, gut microbiota has been regarded as an essential organ, playing critical roles in controlling host metabolic homeostasis and organ physiology. In addition, gut microbiota alterations have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance7, 8. Gut microbiota vary with race, diet and lifestyle9-11. Lifestyles impact the gut microbiota of people of different races living in different countries12-15. However, there have been no reports regarding the alteration of gut microbiota by the westernized lifestyle in the same race and the correlation with insulin resistance. We hypothesized that the alteration of gut microbiota by the westernized lifestyle might correlate with insulin resistance. In the present study, we compared the gut microbiota of native Japanese and Japanese‐American men to investigate the impact of a Westernized lifestyle on gut microbiota, and its correlation with insulin resistance. Methods Participants The study participants comprised of 14 native Japanese men living in Hiroshima, Japan, who were enrolled in medical surveys carried out from April 2016 to March 2017, and 14 Japanese‐American men living in Los Angeles, USA, who were enrolled in medical surveys carried out in August 2015. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) aged ≥45 years to ≤75 years; and (ii) normal glucose tolerance, which was defined as a fasting serum glucose level &lt;110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) and 2‐h post‐load serum glucose level &lt;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) after a 75‐g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) history of inflammatory bowel disease; and (ii) treatment with antibiotics in the 3 months before fecal sampling. After receiving an explanation of the study procedures, each participant provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Hiroshima University (No. E‐139), and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Anthropometric data and biochemical analysis Each participant was interviewed, and underwent physical measurements and venous blood sampling after an overnight fast. The collected blood samples were centrifuged, immediately frozen and stored until analysis. Serum glucose levels were measured by the hexokinase method. Enzyme immunoassay was used to measure serum immunoreactive insulin (IRI). Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were assessed by an enzymatic method. High‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were measured by a homogenous assay. The Matsuda Index was determined as previously described3 and used as an index of insulin resistance. We chose the Matsuda Index, which reflects whole‐body insulin sensitivity, instead of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, which reflects hepatic insulin sensitivity16, as an index of insulin resistance, because gut microbiota is considered to be linked to whole‐body insulin sensitivity17, 18. Nutritional evaluation The dietary intake and dietary habits of all the participants were assessed by a nutritional assessment questionnaire during the examination period. Experienced dietitians analyzed nutrient composition using the nutritional management software, Chatty (Total Software Corp., Kagoshima, Japan). The dietary intake of macronutrients, saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA; all expressed as the percentage of total energy intake) and fiber (g/day) were calculated. Gut microbiota analysis Fecal samples placed in clean, dry, screw‐top collection vials and returned within 24 h after collection were stored immediately at −80°C for gut microbiota analyses. Samples were placed in an insulated container with dry ice for transfer to the laboratory. Total deoxyribonucleic acid extraction from frozen fecal samples was carried out using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as previously described19. Primer pairs, 341F and 785R, were used to amplify the V3‐V4 region of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene as previously described20. Then, amplicons were purified, indexed and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA) following the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol. After sequencing, the reads were quality‐trimmed using the CLC Genomics Workbench 7.5.3 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (v1.8.0)21 was used to analyze the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequence. Sequences were quality filtered using split_libraries_fastq.py Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology script. USEARCH version 6.1 was used to carry out chimera detection22. Operational taxonomic unit data were generated using the UCLUST method with a 97% confidence threshold and classified taxonomically using the GreenGenes version 13.823. Subsequent analyses of diversity were carried out at a depth of 10,000 sequences per sample. Alpha diversity was computed using the Shannon Index. Beta diversity was estimated using weighted UniFrac analysis followed by a principle coordinate analysis. The relative abundance of bacterial groups between each group was calculated using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology. Analyses of short‐chain fatty acids in feces The concentration of short‐chain fatty acids in feces was measured by TechnoSuruga Laboratory Co., Ltd. (Shizuoka, Japan)24. Statistical analysis Data are described as the mean ± standard deviation, for normally distributed data, and median (25th–75th percentile) for data with skewed distribution. Because of the skewed distribution of the data for triglycerides, the area under the curve for serum IRI during the OGTT, the Matsuda Index and the relative abundance of some gut microbiota, these parameters were analyzed after logarithmic transformation. We carried out an unpaired Student's t‐test to analyze differences in the parameters between the two groups, and Pearson's correlation analysis to assess the correlation between age, body mass index (BMI), Matsuda Index, ratio of food intake and gut microbiota at genus level with relative abundance &gt;0.1%. Heatmaps were generated by using the heatmap.2 function of the gplots package in R (version 3.1.3; R Foundation for statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Furthermore, we carried out single and multiple regression analyses to assess the associations between the Matsuda Index and age, BMI, and the relative abundance of gut microbiota. A P‐value &lt;0.05 was considered to show statistical significance. IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac, version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Results Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the study participants. The Japanese‐American men were older and had a lower ratio of PUFA intake than the native Japanese men. No significant differences were observed in BMI, glucose levels during the OGTT and fecal short‐chain fatty acids concentrations between the two groups. Table 1.

Insulin responses of native Japanese and Japanese‐American men to oral glucose load were compared (Figure 1). The 60‐min IRI after OGTT and the area under the curve for serum IRI during the OGTT values were higher in Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (P = 0.004; Figure 1a,b). Furthermore, the Matsuda Index was lower in Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (Figure 1c).

The line in the middle of the box indicates the median value; the box extends from the 25th–75th percentiles. *Statistical significance P &lt; 0.05. Next, the gut microbiota compositions of the two groups were compared (Figure 2). The alpha diversity of the gut microbiota estimated by the Shannon Index was not significantly different between the two groups (Figure 2a). Principle coordinate analysis after weighted UniFrac analysis showed separate clustering of groups (Figure 2b), and an analysis of multi‐response permutation procedures showed significant differences between the groups (A = 0.02, significance of delta = 0.04). Taxonomic analyses showed that the percentage of the Bacteroidetes was lower in the Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (P = 0.044), whereas the percentage of Firmicutes was higher in Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (Figure 2c); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.076). Subsequently, the genus of bacteria that had different distributions in the native Japanese and Japanese‐American men was identified. As a result, the percentages of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequences representing Collinsella within the phylum Actinobacteria, and Parabacteroides and Odoribacter within the phylum Bacteroidetes were lower in the Japanese‐American men than native Japanese men, whereas Faecalibacterium within the phylum Firmicutes were higher (Figure 2d).

The line in the middle of the box indicates the median value; the box extends from the 25th–75th percentiles. Finally, the relationship between insulin resistance and the gut microbiota was investigated. Heat map showed that the Matsuda Index was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Odoribacter in both groups (Figure 3a,b). There was no correlation between age, BMI and the relative abundance of Odoribacter in two groups. Then, we investigated the associations between the gut microbiota and nutrition. The relative abundance of Odoribacter was correlated negatively with the total energy intake, and positively with the ratio of PUFA intake in Japanese‐American men, but not in native Japanese men (Figure S1a,b). There was no correlation between the ratio of PUFA intake and Matsuda Index in two groups (data not shown).

Multiple regression analyses showed that the relative abundance of Odoribacter was a factor that positively explained the Matsuda Index, after adjusting for age and BMI in native Japanese men (β = 0.556, P = 0.006), but this association disappeared after adjusting for age and BMI in Japanese‐American men (β = 0.621, P = 0.108; Table S1). Discussion In the present study, we compared the gut microbiota of the two cohorts of Japanese participants who were of the same race but lived in different countries, and investigated alterations in their gut microbiota and its resulting correlation with insulin resistance. We found that the gut microbiota composition in the Japanese‐American men differed from that in the native Japanese men; in particular, there was lower relative abundance of Odoribacter. The degree of insulin resistance was higher in the Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men. The ratio between relative abundance of Odoribacter and the Matsuda index was positively correlated between the two groups. The results of the present study show that leading a Westernized lifestyle might induce insulin resistance through alterations in the gut microbiota in Japanese people. The composition of the gut microbiota in the Japanese‐American men was different from that observed in the native Japanese men. Previous studies have shown that a Westernized lifestyle decreased alpha diversity12-15. A higher intake of dietary fiber in non‐Westernized societies is considered to contribute to higher alpha diversity25. In the present study, no significant difference in the alpha diversity was observed between the two groups, and decreasing dietary fiber intake in the Japanese population26 might have contributed to the lack of significant difference seen for alpha diversity in this study. The abundance profiles of bacterial taxa differed between the two groups. At the phylum level, previous reports have shown that people with a Westernized lifestyle had increased proportions of Firmicutes and decreased proportions of Bacteroidetes12, 14, which is in accordance with the results of the present study. In this study, Bacteroidetes, not Firmicutes, predominated, which differed from previous observations in Japanese participants27, 28. This difference between studies might be due to the difference in factors including BMI and physical activity of the participants, and methods such as bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid extraction from feces and next‐generation sequencing. At the genus level, those with a Westernized lifestyle had consistently increased proportions of Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Blautia, and decreased proportions of Prevotella12-15. In accordance with previous reports, we found an increased proportion of Faecalibacterium in the Japanese‐American men compared with the native Japanese men, but no other differences in genera were observed in the present study. Previous reports have compared the gut microbiota of individuals in non‐industrialized societies with those with a westernized lifestyle, such as comparing gut microbiota of Europeans and with to that of children in Burkina Faso12, children and adults in Malawi and Amazonian Americans13, adult Hadza hunter‐gatherers in Tanzania14, and adult Papua New Guineans15. Differences in the alteration of gut microbiota in the present study compared with the previous reports might be influenced by ethnicity and the levels of urbanization29, 30. Subsequently, a notable finding of the present study was the decreased proportion of Odoribacter observed in the Japanese‐American men compared with native Japanese men, and that the relative abundance of this gut microbiota was positively correlated to the Matsuda Index in both groups. To date, no study has focused on the relationship between gut microbiota and insulin resistance in Japanese populations. The abundance of Prevotella copri was found to be positively correlated to insulin resistance in non‐diabetic Danish individuals31, and the Bacteroidetes‐to‐Firmicutes ratio was inversely correlated to peripheral insulin sensitivity in non‐diabetic European men in a study from the Netherlands32. To the best of our knowledge, the correlation between Odoribacter and insulin resistance has not been reported on so far. Taking into consideration that fecal metagenomic markers for type 2 diabetes mellitus were different between European and Chinese individuals33, the gut microbiota that correlate to insulin resistance might vary by race, lifestyle and geographical location. On estimating the role of Odoribacter in insulin sensitivity, it was found that Odoribacter produced butyrate34. Oral butyrate treatment was reported to improve insulin sensitivity in healthy lean men35. In the present study, there was no difference in the fecal butyrate concentration between the two groups, and thus butyrate might not have been the main contributor to the differences in the insulin resistance. Odoribacter is also reported to produce sulfobacin B36; sulfobacin B treatment is reported to suppress lipopolysaccharide‐induced inflammation in mice37. Considering that the levels of C‐reactive protein, an inflammatory marker, are reportedly lower in native Japanese than in Japanese‐Americans3, Odoribacter‐produced sulfobacin B might exert an anti‐inflammatory effect and partially contribute to improved insulin sensitivity. Finally, the ratio of PUFA intake is shown to be less in Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (P = 0.041; Table 1). Considering our previous report that the ratio of serum eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid was lower in Japanese‐American than native Japanese38, Japanese‐Americans possibly have a lower intake of PUFA, especially omega‐3 fatty acids, than native Japanese. The Western diet is characterized by high intake of simple carbohydrates, and saturated and omega‐6 fatty acids, and low intake of omega‐3 fatty acids and fiber39-41. In the present study, Japanese‐American men showed a higher trend in the ratio of SFA intake and less ratio of PUFA intake than native Japanese men, which could be indicators of a Westernized lifestyle. In this study, the relative abundance of Odoribacter was correlated positively with the ratio of PUFA in Japanese‐American men, but not in native Japanese men (Figure S1a,b). There was no report about the relationship between PUFA intake and gut microbiota in Japanese. In Western countries, there was also no report about the relationship between PUFA intake and Odoribacter42. These data suggest that gut microbiota response to PUFA intake could also vary by race and lifestyle. The present study had several limitations. First, the participants in this study were limited to native Japanese men and Japanese‐American men participating in one medical survey with a sample size that was relatively small. To ensure reproducible results, a larger study trial is required. In addition, considering that men and women have different gut microbiota, and the fact that the impact on insulin sensitivity associated with it also varies32, we restricted the study to only men. Further studies that include women are required to understand the differences of the impact of a Westernized lifestyle on the gut microbiota of both sexes and its correlation with insulin resistance. Second, the present study comprised only Japanese people. While elucidating the alteration of gut microbiota according to a Westernized lifestyle in the same race and identifying a correlation with insulin resistance is a strong point of this study, the results cannot be generalized to other ethnic groups. Finally, this was a cross‐sectional study, thus, causal relationships could not be observed. To investigate the mechanism by which Westernized lifestyles alter the gut microbiota and subsequently induce insulin resistance, future experiments, such as serum or fecal metabolomics, are necessary. In conclusion, the present study showed that Japanese men with Westernized lifestyles had altered gut microbiota, and this correlated with insulin resistance in those without diabetes. Thus, these gut microbiota alterations might be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Lifestyle‐related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are increasing worldwide, especially in Asia. The present study could provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of Westernized lifestyle‐related metabolic disorders, and might offer novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in patients with those disorders.

Ablation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) or the protein kinase Hippo signaling pathway induces liver cancer via activation of AKT or the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ, respectively; however, the potential for crosstalk between the PTEN/AKT and Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathways in liver tumorigenesis has thus far remained unclear. Here, we have shown that deletion of both PTEN and SAV1 in the liver accelerates the development of NAFLD and liver cancer in mice. At the molecular level, activation of YAP/TAZ in the liver of Pten–/– Sav1–/– mice amplified AKT signaling through the upregulation of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) expression. Both ablation of YAP/TAZ and activation of the Hippo pathway could rescue these phenotypes. A high level of YAP/ TAZ expression was associated with a high level of IRS2 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 or knockout of IRS2 by AAV-Cas9 successfully repressed liver tumorigenesis in Pten–/– Sav1–/– mice. Thus, our findings suggest that Hippo signaling interacts with AKT signaling by regulating IRS2 expression to prevent NAFLD and liver cancer progression and provide evidence that impaired crosstalk between these 2 pathways accelerates NAFLD and liver cancer.IntroductionNAFLD is characterized by an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver. The most severe form of NAFLD, NASH, often progresses to liver cancer (1–3). Tracking with the increasing prevalence of general obesity, 30% of the US population is now estimated to have NAFLD, and 25% of these individuals will develop NASH (1, 3). Currently, there are no effective therapies to prevent the incidence and progression of NAFLD or NASH (4). This makes clarification of the detailed mechanisms of disease progression using appropriate animal models that much more urgent.Insulin signaling begins with the binding of insulin to the insulin receptor (IR). This then phosphorylates insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) and subsequently triggers the recruitment of PI3K and the activation of AKT (5–9). Deletion of IRS1 and IRS2 in the mouse liver reduces AKT activity and gives rise to insulin resistance (10). Excessive AKT activation leads to the development of NAFLD by promoting the maturation of the transcription factor SREBP1c (11, 12). In its mature form, SREBP1c contributes to the induction of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which are key enzymes in de novo lipogenesis (13). Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a negative regulator of AKT signaling, and several human cancers are associated with mutations or downregulation of the PTEN gene (14–16). Liver-specific PTEN-knockout mice progressively develop NAFLD, NASH, and HCC (17, 18) as a result of increased AKT signaling (19).The Hippo signaling pathway has been implicated in the suppression of tissue regeneration, the proliferation of stem cells, and the development of cancer by inhibiting the oncogenic activity of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (20, 21). In mice, liver-specific knockout of the Hippo pathway components MST1/2, SAV1, or NF2 induces the expansion of hepatic progenitor cells via YAP/TAZ activation and leads eventually to the development of liver cancer (HCC, cholangiocarcinoma [CC], or both) (22–25). Despite its importance in tumorigenesis, the role of Hippo signaling in the metabolic dysregulation that precedes the development of liver cancer remains unclear.Previous studies have suggested that YAP regulates components of the AKT pathway (i.e., PI3K, PTEN, and AKT) and that the Drosophila Hippo ortholog MST1 binds and inhibits AKT directly (26–29). Increased YAP expression in human liver tumors is associated with high levels of p-AKT (30, 31). This suggests that crosstalk between the Hippo and AKT pathways may be important in the maintenance of functional liver homeostasis. The molecular coordination of these 2 pathways in liver tumorigenesis, however, has not been revealed. Using several mouse models, we now show that such crosstalk does indeed occur in the liver, that it is mediated at the level of YAP/TAZ and IRS2, and that it plays a key role in the development of NAFLD and its progression to liver cancer.ResultsDeletion of both PTEN and SAV1 in the liver promotes NAFLD, NASH, and tumorigenesis. To investigate any potential crosstalk between the Hippo and AKT pathways in vivo, we first generated liver-specific PTEN and SAV1 double-knockout mice (Pten–/– Sav1–/–, referred to herein as DKO mice) (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI95802DS1). Consistent with previous observations (23), SAV1-deficient (Sav1fl/fl; albumin-Cre or Sav1–/–) mice had a slight enlargement of the liver, whereas PTEN-deficient (Ptenfl/fl; albumin-Cre or Pten–/–) mice developed fatty livers (Figure 1A). In contrast, the DKO mice had highly advanced liver tumors at 5 months of age (Figure 1A), with significantly increased liver weights at 2 and 4 months of age (Figure 1E). While Sav1–/– and Pten–/– mice developed liver tumors at 50 to 60 weeks, all DKO mice developed such tumors by 15 weeks (Figure 1B). Thus, DKO mice showed a marked acceleration of tumorigenesis with a corresponding reduction in survival (Figure 1, B and C). In addition, while Pten–/– mice developed only HCC (17, 18), Sav1–/– mice (23) and DKO mice developed both HCC and CC (Supplemental Figure 1B).Figure 1Liver-specific deletion of Pten and Sav1 accelerates the development of fatty liver and tumorigenesis.

(A–G) n = 5 WT mice; (A) n = 5 mice, (B–D) n = 8 mice, and (E–G) n = 3 mice of the other 3 genotypes.Given that Pten–/– liver cancer proceeds through NAFLD and NASH (17, 18), we examined young DKO mice for phenotypic changes occurring prior to tumor development. One-month-old DKO livers showed excessive fatty acid accumulation (Oil red O), similar to what was observed in NAFLD. This phenotype, however, did not appear in Pten–/– mouse livers until 3 months of age (H&amp;E) (Figure 1D). Acute deletion of Pten and Sav1 in the adult stage using a CRE-encoding adenovirus also consistently led to the development of NAFLD (Supplemental Figure 1, D and E). DKO mouse livers also had an excessive accumulation of glycogen (PAS) at 1 month of age (Figure 1D) that grew progressively worse with time (Supplemental Figure 1C). Moreover, 3-month-old DKO livers showed increased apoptosis (TUNEL) and macrophage accumulation (F4/80) (Figure 1D and Figure 1G). Because these are associated with advanced NAFLD (H&amp;E) and fibrosis (Picrosirius red) (Figure 1D), they suggested progression to NASH. DKO mice showed significantly increased serum AST and ALT levels at 3 months of age (Figure 1F) as well as increased pan-cytokeratin–positive (pan-CK–positive) hepatic progenitor cells in nonductal regions at 5 months of age (Supplemental Figure 1C). Collectively, these results indicate that deletion of Sav1 accelerates the progression of Pten–/– livers through the steps of NAFLD, NASH, cirrhosis, and cancer. We therefore decided to focus on the development of NAFLD as a precursor of liver tumorigenesis.Increased AKT signaling accelerates the development of fatty liver in Pten–/– Sav1–/– mice. We next performed gene expression profiling on the DKO mice to explore the mechanism underlying their early development of NAFLD. We found that DKO livers had increased expression of genes related to insulin signaling (i.e., Pdk4, Igfbp1, and Irs2) and reduced expression of genes related to carbohydrate or glucose metabolism (i.e., Pygb, Slc2a2, Pklr, and Aacs) (Figure 2A). In a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of DKO livers relative to Pten–/– livers, we found enrichment of gene signatures related to lipogenesis and insulin signaling, including IRS targets and gene sets related to steroid biosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis, and fatty acid metabolism (Figure 2B and Table 1). Given these observations, we asked whether AKT acts as an effector molecule in the dysregulation of liver metabolism we observed in DKO mice.Figure 2Deletion of SAV1 potentiates AKT signaling in PTEN-deficient livers.

(A and B) n = 2 mice; (C–G) n = 3 or 5 mice.Table 1List of upregulated GSEA gene signatures for Pten–/– Sav1–/– livers compared with Pten–/– liversAs expected, Pten deletion led to activation of AKT, as evidenced by increased levels of p-AKT (Figure 2C). Surprisingly, DKO livers showed even greater AKT activation than did Pten–/– livers, while neither Sav1–/– nor WT livers showed any such activation, presumably because of the presence of PTEN (Figure 2C). Consistent with this result, DKO livers also showed greater increases downstream of AKT signaling than did Pten–/– livers, including increased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p-GSK3β), increased processing of SREBP1c, and upregulation of FAS and ACC (Figure 2C). This increase in p-GSK3β in DKO livers is also consistent with their excessive accumulation of glycogen (18) (Figure 1D, PAS staining). Using IHC, we also observed increases in p-AKT and PIP3 in DKO hepatocytes but not biliary cells or infiltrated immune cells (Figure 2D), suggesting that the dysregulation of liver metabolism in DKO mice depends on cell-autonomous signaling. DKO livers showed increased expression of lipogenesis-related genes (i.e., Fasn, Acc1, and Scd1) and SREBP family genes (i.e., Srebp1a, Srebp1c, and Srebp2) (Figure 2, E and F). They also showed increased expression of inflammation-related genes such as IL-6 (Il6) and TNF-α (Tnfa), indicating the progression of chronic NAFLD to NASH (Figure 2G). In summary, DKO livers showed increased AKT activation, lipogenesis, glycogenesis, and inflammation.YAP/TAZ enhance AKT activation and the development of fatty liver in the absence of PTEN. To identify the mechanism underlying the enhanced AKT activation we observed in DKO livers, we examined the status of the various Hippo pathway components. Consistent with the role of SAV1 as an upstream regulator of LATS (23), SAV1-deficient livers (from both Sav1–/– and DKO mice) showed reduced LATS activation (p-LATS) that was also associated with increased levels of YAP but low levels of p-YAP (Figure 3A). Both Pten–/– and Sav1–/– mice showed increased levels of TAZ compared with expression levels in WT mice, but the increase in TAZ in DKO mice was even greater (Figure 3A). We confirmed the increased levels of YAP and TAZ in DKO livers via IHC (Figure 3B). Interestingly, we found high levels of YAP expression only in the nuclei of DKO mouse liver cells compared with liver cells from the other groups, but we found abundant TAZ in both the cytoplasm and nuclei (Figure 3, C and D). The increased expression of the YAP/TAZ targets CTGF and CYR61 provided further confirmation of the upregulation of YAP/TAZ activity in DKO livers (Figure 3A).Figure 3Increased TAZ or YAP activity promotes NAFLD via AKT activation.

In WT mice, we found that liver size and morphology remained unaffected 4 days after injection of the viruses inducing the expression of TAZ4SA or YAP5SA (Figure 3E, and Supplemental Figure 2, A and B). On the other hand, in Pten–/– mice under the same experimental conditions, the expression of TAZ4SA or YAP5SA induced hepatomegaly, promoted the development of NAFLD without fibrosis or inflammation (Figure 3F, and Supplemental Figure 2, A and C), and elicited marked increases in p-AKT and FAS (Figure 3, G and H). The fact that TAZ4SA and YAP5SA did not affect p-AKT levels in WT livers (Figure 3, G and H) suggests that PTEN was able to rapidly convert PIP3 to PIP2 and thereby prevent AKT activation. This observation suggests that PTEN deficiency is a suitable genetic background in which to study the role of YAP/TAZ in AKT signaling and metabolic dysfunction. These results also support the finding that the upregulation of YAP/TAZ promotes fatty liver development in the Pten–/– background by increasing AKT activity.Transcriptional regulation of Irs2 by YAP/TAZ. The next question we addressed was how YAP and TAZ potentiate AKT activity in Pten–/– livers. In DKO livers, we observed a marked increase in PIP3, a direct upstream activator of AKT (Figure 2E). We also observed increased levels of p-ERK (Figure 4A), a downstream target of PIP3. We therefore hypothesized that YAP and TAZ may serve as upstream regulators of AKT. DKO mice showed dramatic increases in IRS2, but not IR, IRS1, or PI3K (Figure 4A). In addition, the increase in Irs2 mRNA we observed in DKO mice was more significant than the increase we observed in Sav1–/– or Pten–/– mice (Figure 4B). This is reminiscent of the pattern we observed for YAP/TAZ expression in these same animals (Figure 3, A and B) and is consistent with our microarray analysis showing that DKO mice expressed higher levels of Irs2 mRNA and IRS target genes than did Pten–/– mice (Figure 2, A–C). Together, these results suggest that YAP/TAZ activation in DKO livers increases insulin signaling by upregulating IRS2.Figure 4YAP/TAZ directly activate Irs2 transcription through TEAD binding.

We found slight increases in IRS2 expression associated with the depletion of either PTEN or SAV1 in this cell line, but an even greater increase in IRS2 expression associated with the simultaneous knockdown of both PTEN and SAV1 (Figure 4C). While SAV1 depletion did not affect insulin-induced AKT activation, depletion of both SAV1 and PTEN enhanced AKT activation by dramatically increasing IRS2 expression (Figure 4D). We also found that overexpression of IRS2 induced AKT activation (Figure 4E) and knockdown of IRS2 in PTEN and SAV1-depleted cells attenuated their insulin-induced activation of AKT (Figure 4F).Since the transcription factor TEAD binds YAP/TAZ for target gene transcription (33), we asked whether YAP/TAZ can directly regulate Irs2 expression through TEAD. We found that TAZ4SA, but not the TEAD-binding deficient mutant (TAZ4SA/S51A), could enhance IRS2 expression and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 4G). There are 6 potential TEAD-binding sites (TBSs) within the distal promoter and first intron of Irs2 (Figure 4H). TAZ4SA, but not TAZ4SA/S51A, activated reporter constructs containing TBS2, TBS4, or TBS5, but it could not activate reporters lacking these binding sites (TBSsΔ) (Figure 4I). By performing ChIP–quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, we found that TAZ binds TBS2 and TBS5 of Irs2 (Figure 4J). These results indicate that the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex directly induces the transcription of Irs2, thereby promoting AKT signaling.Deletion of YAP/TAZ or activation of Hippo signaling attenuates fatty liver development by downregulation of IRS2. To confirm the role of YAP/TAZ in the DKO mouse phenotype, we generated DKO mice that also carried conditional Yap and/or Taz alleles (Supplemental Figure 3A). We observed mild improvement in the fatty liver phenotypes of 4-week-old Pten–/– Sav1–/– Taz–/– (PST triple-knockout [TKO]) and Pten–/– Sav1–/– Yap–/– (PSY TKO) mice compared with that seen in DKO mice (Figure 5A). In contrast, deletion of both Yap and Taz in DKO mice (PSYT quadruple-knockout [QKO]) rescued the DKO fatty liver phenotype (Figure 5A). QKO mice also had a reduced abundance of IRS2, p-AKT, p-GSK3β, and FAS (Figure 5B), and less upregulation of Irs2 mRNA than did DKO mice (Figure 5C). DKO and either PST or PSY TKO livers did not differ in their p-AKT levels (Figure 5B), presumably because of some sort of compensatory regulation of YAP or TAZ in TKO livers (34). We detected a reduced p-YAP/YAP ratio in PST TKO mice compared with DKO mice, suggesting that PST TKO mice have more active YAP. In PSY TKO mice, it was TAZ that appeared in greater abundance than was observed in DKO mice (Figure 5B). Unexpectedly, although we did not see any reduction in the liver-to-body weight ratio of PSYT QKO mice compared with that of DKO mice, QKO mice developed severe liver fibrosis, and their serum was much yellower than that of WT mice (Supplemental Figure 3, B–D). As previously reported (25, 35), Yap–/– Taz–/– mice do not form biliary ducts (CK19-negative) and have chronic liver damage and fibrosis (Supplemental Figure 4, A–F). The fibrotic changes we observed in PSYT QKO livers were likely due to the toxicity that arose because of the YAP/TAZ ablation–induced malformation of the biliary duct cells (Supplemental Figure 3C). Despite this complication, our results indicate that loss of Yap/Taz can rescue the NAFLD phenotype in hepatocytes of DKO mice.Figure 5Deletion of Yap/Taz rescues the NAFLD phenotype via downregulation of IRS2/AKT signaling.

Quantitative data represent the mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05 versus DKO; ††P &lt; 0.01 for the indicated comparisons (1-way ANOVA).Next, to determine whether the components of the Hippo pathway upstream of YAP/TAZ inhibit AKT signaling, we generated Pten–/– mice expressing transgenes encoding either a WT (MSTWTTg) or kinase-dead mutant (MSTkdTg) form of human MST1, which is a binding partner of SAV1 and an activator of the Hippo pathway (Supplemental Figure 5A). Pten–/– MSTWTTg livers, but not Pten–/– MSTkdTg livers, were smaller and had less lipid droplet accumulation than did Pten–/– livers (Figure 6, A and B, and Supplemental Figure 5, B and C). In contrast to Pten–/– MSTkdTg livers, Pten–/– MSTWTTg livers also showed lower AKT activation and IRS2 expression than did Pten–/– livers (Figure 6C and Supplemental Figure 5D). In addition, overexpression of MST1WTTg, but not MSTkdTg, increased LATS activation and decreased YAP/TAZ abundance (Figure 6, B and C). Together, these data indicate that enhanced Hippo pathway activity inhibits AKT signaling, probably by inhibiting the YAP/TAZ-mediated regulation of IRS2 and, consequently, attenuates the development of NAFLD.Figure 6Activation of the Hippo pathway rescues the NAFLD phenotype through suppression of IRS2/AKT signaling. (A–C) Macroscopic appearance (A), H&amp;E, Oil red O, TAZ, and YAP immunohistochemical staining (B), as well as immunoblot analysis (C) of livers from 2-month-old Pten–/– and Pten–/– MSTWTTg mice (n = 4). Scale bars: 50 μm (top 2 rows) and 100 μm (bottom 2 rows). β-Actin was used as a loading control in C.YAP/TAZ and IRS2/p-AKT are positively correlated in HCC patients' specimens. To extend our results in mice to humans, we examined the hepatic expression of YAP, TAZ, and IRS2 in HCC patients' samples. The human HCC and cirrhosis databases showed positive correlations between IRS2 and YAP or TAZ mRNA levels (36–38) (Figure 7A). Furthermore, we also found significantly positive correlations between IRS2 levels and the downstream targets of YAP/TAZ (e.g., CTGF and CYR61) (Figure 7B). IRS2 protein levels were also positively correlated with TAZ/YAP levels in human HCC samples: 77% of specimens with high TAZ levels and 81% of specimens with high YAP levels also expressed high levels of IRS2 (Figure 7, C and D). More important, HCC specimens with associated NAFLD show significantly higher IHC intensities for TAZ, YAP, IRS2, and p-AKT(Ser473) than did HCC samples without NAFLD (Figure 7, E and F, and Supplemental Figure 6, A–C). These results suggest that YAP and TAZ are critical in the development of fatty liver and its progression to liver cancer in humans via the upregulation of IRS2 and subsequent AKT activation.Figure 7Correlation of TAZ/YAP and IRS2–p-AKT expression in patients with liver cancer.

ND, not detected.Inhibition of AKT signaling or silencing of IRS2 attenuates the development of liver cancer. Given the lack of treatments for NASH (4), we next asked whether pharmacological inhibition of AKT could ameliorate fatty liver and slow cancer progression in DKO mice. To this end, we administered the pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 (phase II clinical trials) intraperitoneally to 3-week-old DKO mice. We found that MK-2206–treated DKO mice had less fatty liver, decreased liver weight, and reduced liver fibrosis as well as improved liver function and lower expression of lipogenesis-related genes (i.e., Fasn, Acc1, and Srebp1c) than did vehicle-treated DKO (control) mice (Figure 8, A–D, and Supplemental Figure 7A). While 80% of 12-week-old DKO mice had liver tumors (Figure 1B), MK-2206–treated DKO mice showed reduced fatty liver and tumorigenesis, as revealed by their reduced liver size, normalized liver color, and reduction in tumor nodule size, despite similar tumor nodule numbers and serum chemistry (Figure 8, E–H). MK-2206–treated DKO livers had fewer hepatocytes with excessive lipid droplets (H&amp;E), reduced fibrosis (Picrosirius red), fewer Ki-67–positive cells, and lower levels of hepatocyte TAZ expression without a corresponding change in YAP expression (Figure 8, I and J, and Supplemental Figure 7B). These effects were also accompanied by reduced expression of genes related to fibrosis (i.e., Acta2, desmin, and Tgfb), cell death or injury (i.e., Hmox1 and Gadd153), and inflammation (i.e., Tnfa) (Figure 8K). Together, these results indicate that, like Hippo pathway activation (Figure 6, A–C), AKT inhibitor treatment markedly attenuates the development of NAFLD and liver cancer in DKO mice.Figure 8Treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 attenuates the development of NAFLD and liver tumor progression.

Importantly, we found that deletion of Irs2 in DKO livers rescued the cancerous phenotypes of control virus–injected (sgCtl-injected) DKO mice. sgIrs2-injected DKO livers showed significant reductions in the number and size of cancer nodules by reducing their levels of p-AKT (Figure 9, A–D). We did not, however, detect any attenuation of NAFLD progression by injection of sgIrs2 into 5-week-old mice, which already had advanced NAFLD (Figure 9E). Because the rapid progression of tumor formation in DKO livers stems from their enhanced development of fatty liver, the suppression of IRS2 significantly prevents disease progression from NAFLD to cancer (Figure 9E). Collectively, these results suggest that increased IRS2 expression in DKO liver is the key factor promoting liver cancer progression.Figure 9Suppression of Irs2 attenuates the development of liver tumor progression.

Importantly, we have shown that this hyperactivation of AKT in the liver arises from a positive feedback loop that links YAP/TAZ and IRS2/AKT signaling (Figure 10). This positive feedback loop functions as follows: (a) Loss of PTEN induces AKT activation and the consequent stabilization of TAZ via GSK3b/bTrCP signaling (40). The loss of SAV1 also activates YAP/TAZ. (b) Activated YAP/TAZ then directly induces IRS2 transcription. (c) The resulting upregulation of IRS2 promotes the activation of PI3K, further enhancing the AKT activity already increased by PTEN deletion. This increased activation of AKT further stabilizes TAZ, thereby completing the positive feedback loop that leads to hyperactivation of AKT and development of NAFLD.Figure 10Schematic for the positive feedback loop linking Hippo/YAP/TAZ and IRS2/AKT signaling in the liver of DKO (Pten–/– Sav1–/–) mice. Hippo signaling interacts with AKT signaling by regulating IRS2 expression and prevents NAFLD and liver cancer progression.Our results identify new approaches to the prevention and/or treatment of NAFLD and liver cancer. We found that treatment with the pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 attenuated the development of NAFLD and reduced tumor growth in DKO mice. Of note, MK-2206 has anticancer activity in humans (41–43) and has been evaluated for the treatment of liver cancer in clinical trials (https://ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01425879 and NCT01239355). Our finding that the amplification of AKT activity stems from the function of a positive feedback loop linking YAP/TAZ and AKT suggests that AKT inhibitors may be particularly effective against liver tumors that show high levels of YAP/TAZ and AKT activity. In contrast to treatment with MK-2206, treatment with verteporfin did not block the progression of the NAFLD phenotype of DKO mouse livers (data not shown). It is possible that the inhibitory action of verteporfin was insufficient to counteract the hyperactivated YAP/TAZ in DKO mice. Given that DKO mice develop NAFLD and NASH that lead to liver cancer at an early age, a progression that resembles that of human liver disease, we expect that the DKO mouse model will prove valuable in the validation of drugs targeting AKT-dependent liver disease.Our discovery of the link between the Hippo-YAP/TAZ and IRS2/AKT signaling pathways may explain the positive correlation between nuclear YAP1 abundance and AKT activity that was previously identified in human liver tissue specimens (30, 31) as well as the correlation between IRS2 and YAP1 or TAZ expression we observed in this study. These 2 pathways were previously linked by the observation that YAP-mediated induction of miR-29 inhibits PTEN (28), but we were unable to detect any difference in PTEN abundance between Yap–/– Taz–/– and WT livers (Supplemental Figure 4G). In addition, we found that DKO mice developed HCC/CC mixed-type tumors in the liver, despite the presence of highly active AKT and PIP3 in their hepatocytes (Figure 2D and Supplemental Figure 1B). Consistent with a previous report that YAP/TAZ activation can convert hepatocytes to progenitor/ductal cells (35), our results suggest that, in addition to inducing HCC, hyperactivated YAP/TAZ in DKO hepatocytes can also induce the development of ductal cell–derived CC by altering liver cell types.The effects of TAZ on inflammation were recently implicated in the progression of NASH (44). Luo et al. suggested that the liver microenvironment is a key factor for NASH-derived cancer development in Pten and Shp2 DKO mice (45). Here, we found that the increased levels of TAZ in DKO livers were associated with enhanced immune cell infiltration and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in the liver (Figure 1D, Figure 2G, and Table 1), as well as with the rapid development of NASH. The rescue models in our study (Pten–/– MSTWTTg and AKT inhibitor treatment) are also consistent with the hypothesis that suppression of AKT attenuates the development of advanced liver disease by reducing inflammation. It remains unclear, however, whether the increased inflammation observed in DKO livers depends primarily on AKT signaling, Hippo signaling, or another signaling pathway. Moreover, considering the reciprocal effects observed in the hepatic microenvironment, further studies of the relationship between accelerated disease progression and the regulation of DKO liver tissue microenvironments are necessary.Although several studies have identified unidirectional interactions between the Hippo and AKT signaling pathways, our results revealed bilateral crosstalk between these pathways. We found that AKT signaling regulates the Hippo pathway by affecting TAZ protein stability in the liver. Pten–/– livers showed increased TAZ, the detailed mechanism of which was characterized in vitro (40). Most important, we observed that AKT inhibitor treatment significantly reduced TAZ abundance. On the other hand, the Hippo pathway also regulated AKT signaling through the transcriptional control of IRS2. In other words, both pathways must be fine-tuned to maintain liver homeostasis, because their dysregulation leads to liver disease. Furthermore, although it is well known that both Pten–/– and Sav1–/– livers develop cancer, our findings revealed that Pten–/– Sav1–/– mice developed NAFLD faster than did Pten–/– mice. In fact, Pten–/– mice developed NAFLD at a later age, while Sav1–/– mice did not develop NAFLD. We therefore suggest that the Hippo and PTEN/AKT pathways may not work in parallel. Instead, the Hippo and PTEN/AKT pathways seem to converge in the development of NAFLD, thus producing synergistic effects in the development of liver cancer.We have demonstrated the importance of a positive feedback loop linking YAP/TAZ with IRS2/AKT signaling in the development of NAFLD, NASH, and liver cancer. We believe our identification of this link between these 2 pathways will facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches for liver disease. Treatments combining AKT inhibitors and YAP/TAZ inhibitors may produce synergistic effects to prevent liver disease and/or inhibit liver tumorigenesis. Moreover, IRS2 is regulated by transcriptional regulators such as SREBP1c, STAT3, and HIF2α (46–48). We can now expand this list to include YAP/TAZ, which we have shown to be a bona fide transcriptional regulator of IRS2, and we anticipate that this expansion of the known regulators of IRS2 will also facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat liver disease (8, 49, 50).MethodsGeneration of liver-specific knockout and transgenic mice. Sav1fl/fl, Ptenfl/fl, Yapfl/fl, Tazfl/fl, MSTWTTg, and MSTkdTg mice were generated as previously described (17, 23, 51–53). Mice were crossed as indicated to obtain the desired genotypes. Mice were genotyped by PCR analysis using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 1. Only male mice were used for the present study, and they were deprived of food for 16 hours before sacrifice. Adenovirus for overexpression of CRE, YAP5SA, TAZ4SA, or GFP (control) and AAV-saCas9-sgIrs2 or sgCtl in the mouse liver were injected into the tail vain of 6- and 5-week-old mice, respectively. The mice were deprived of food for 16 hours at day 4 (YAP5SA, TAZ4SA, and GFP) or week 4 (CRE and GFP) after adenovirus injection. MK-2206 (Selleckchem; S1078) was prepared in 30% Captisol (CyDex Pharmaceuticals; RC-0C7) and administered to DKO mice by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 66 mg/kg every other day for 2 weeks, beginning at 3 or 12 weeks of age.Histology, immunostaining, and TUNEL staining. For immunohistochemical staining, 4-μm liver sections on slides were serially rehydrated with xylene and ethanol before heat-induced antigen retrieval (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0; Duchefa). The antigen retrieval step was skipped for slides stained with the anti-IRS2 antibody. Blocking was performed with 0.3% BSA in PBS for the p-AKT–specific antibody and 5% goat serum in 3% BSA including 0.3% Triton-X for all other antibodies. After quenching endogenous peroxidases with hydrogen peroxide (Merck), the samples were incubated with a primary antibody in blocking solution. After washing and incubation with an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:500), DAB (Vector Laboratories) was added for antigen detection. Finally, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. The antibodies used for immunohistochemical and immunohistofluorescence staining included those specific to Ser473 phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) (Cell Signaling Technology; 4060); TAZ (MilliporeSigma; HPA007415); YAP (Cell Signaling Technology; 4912); Ki-67 (Abcam; 16667); pan-CK (Dako; Z0622); CK19 (Abcam; 15464); F4/80 (Abcam; 105155); PIP3 (Echelon; Z-P345); and IRS2 (Abcam; 84906). For Oil red O staining, cryosections (10-μm thickness) of liver tissue were fixed with cold 10% formalin, dehydrated with 100% propylene glycol (MilliporeSigma; 398039), washed with 85% propylene glycol, and then stained with 0.5% Oil red O (MilliporeSigma; O0625). The sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (MilliporeSigma; MHS1). Staining with Picrosirius red was performed with a solution of 0.1% Direct Red (MilliporeSigma; 365548) and 0.1% Fast Green (MilliporeSigma; F7252) in picric acid and subsequently incubated in 0.5% acetic acid. For PAS staining, the sections were incubated with 0.5% periodic acid followed by the Schiff reagent (MilliporeSigma; 3952016). TUNEL staining was performed with the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche; 11684795910).Immunoblot analysis. Liver or AML12 cell lysates were prepared with Proprep Lysis Buffer (Intron Biotechnology) and NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% nonidet P-40), respectively. For nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation analysis, frozen liver tissue was added to lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.8], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors) for cytoplasmic extraction. After grinding the tissue with a hand pestle, the tissues were mixed with 0.3% NP-40 by vortexing for 5 seconds, and the cytoplasmic fraction was obtained from the supernatant after centrifugation. After 2 washes in PBS, the pellet was boiled in sample buffer and used as the nuclear fraction. The primary antibodies for the immunoblot analyses included those specific to p-AKT (catalog 4051 or 4056), AKT2 (catalog 3063), p-GSK3β (catalog 9336), p-S6K (catalog 9205), FAS (catalog 3189), p-ACC (catalog 3661), PTEN (catalog 9559), MST1 (catalog 3682), p-YAP (catalog 4911), YAP (catalog 4912), TAZ (catalog 4883), LATS2 (catalog 5888), p-LATS (catalog 8654), and p-ERK (catalog 4376) (all from Cell Signaling Technology); to IR (catalog 07-724), the p85 subunit of PI3K (catalog 06-195), IRS1 (catalog 06-248), and IRS2 (catalog 06-506) (all from MilliporeSigma); to SREBP1 (catalog 28481), FAS (catalog 196854), ACC (catalog 45174), and GAPDH (catalog 125247) (all from Abcam); to lamin B (catalogs 6217), CTGF (catalog 14939), and CYR61 (catalog 13100) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology); to β-actin (catalog A5316; MilliporeSigma); and to α-tubulin (catalog LF-PA0146; Abfrontier). The SAV1-specific antibody was developed in our laboratory. See complete unedited blots in the supplemental material.Adenovirus and AAV preparation. The CRE, human TAZ4SA, and YAP5SA cDNAs were cloned separately into the pAdtrack-CMV-GFP vector. The resulting vectors were then recombined with the pAdEasy-1 vector in BJ5183-AD-1 electroporation–competent cells (Agilent Technologies; 240005 and 200157). The recombinant DNA was linearized with PacI and introduced into 293AD cells by transfection with polyethylenimine (Polyscience; 23966). After checking the cells for GFP expression, we pelleted them with centrifugation, resuspended them with 10% glycerol in PBS, and lysed them with 4 freeze-thaw cycles (LN2 and a 37°C water bath) to release their viruses. To amplify the adenoviruses, we repeated this step with increasing numbers of cells. The adenoviruses were finally purified by ultracentrifugation at 46,000 × g for 2 hours at 4°C on a discontinuous gradient from 2.2 to 4.0 M CsCl (Amresco) in 10 mM HEPES (MilliporeSigma). The adenovirus-containing layer was removed with a syringe needle, and the viruses were washed twice in a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 2 mM MgCl2 using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (MilliporeSigma; UFC810024). Virus titration was performed by counting exposed 293AD or target cells positive for GFP with a fluorescence microscope. A total of 1 × 109 to 1 × 1010 PFU were used for tail-vein injections. For the generation of an AAV encoding saCas9-sgRNA against Irs2, we used the pX602-AAV-TBG::NLS-SaCas9-NLS-HA-OLLAS-bGHpA;U6::BsaI-sgRNA vector, which was purchased from Addgene (plasmid 61593) (39). The steps for AAV generation, concentration, and purification were performed as previously described (39). Genomic copies of AAV (2 × 1010 to 2 × 1011) were used for tail-vein injections into 5-week-old mice that were analyzed 7 weeks later. The oligonucleotide sequences for sgIrs2 are listed in Supplemental Table 1.Generation of stable knockdown or overexpression of cell lines. To generate knockdown constructs, the plko.1 vector was digested with EcoRI and AgeI and ligated with annealed oligonucleotides encoding SAV1 or PTEN shRNAs (5′-CCGGCGGCTACATCTCTAGGGAATTCTCGAGAATTCCCTAGAGATGTAGCCGTTTTT-3′ and 5′-CCGGCAACCGATACTTCTCTCCAAACTCGAGTTTGGAGAGAAGTATCGGTTGTTTTT-3′, respectively). The shRNA constructs were transfected into 293T cells, together with psPAX2 and pMD2G. After 2 days, viral particles were harvested from the culture media by filtration. The viruses were then used to infect AML12 cells in the presence of polybrene (6 μg/ml) (MilliporeSigma; H9268), and stable cell lines were obtained via antibiotic selection with 10 μg/ml puromycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific; A11138-03) or 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 10687010). We cloned TAZ4SA, TAZ4SA/S51A, and YAP5SA into pMSCV-puro vector (catalog 631461; Clontech), or purchased IRS2 construct (catalog DU4859; MRC PPU Reagents) for generating AML12 stable cell line expressing those genes, respectively. Next, the resulting constructs were used to prepare recombinant retroviruses for infection and subsequent puromycin selection of infected cells.Knockdown of IRS2 with siRNA in AML12 cells. An AML12 cell line stably expressing shPten and shSav1 was transfected with 20 nM siRNA (ST Pharm Oligo Center) using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 13778-150) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days later, the cells were deprived of serum for sixteen hours and then treated with insulin (100 nM). The oligonucleotide sequence information was provided by Calvin J. Kuo (Stanford University School of Medicine, CA, USA) (47). An AML12 cell line was purchased from ATCC and maintained in DMEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 12100046) containing 10% FBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 12483020), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 15140122), 0.005 mg/ml insulin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 12585014), 0.005 mg/ml transferrin (MilliporeSigma; T8158), 5 ng/ml selenium (MilliporeSigma; S5261), and 40 ng/ml dexamethasone (MilliporeSigma; D4902) in a humidity-controlled environment (37°C, 5% CO2). The cell line was confirmed to be mycoplasma free with a Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (Intron; 25233).Luciferase assay. The indicated portions of the Irs2 genomic locus, including 6 potential TBSs, were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Each mutant construct was generated by deletion of specific TBSs. 293T cells were cotransfected with a Renilla plasmid, a TEAD-encoding plasmid, and the constructs of interest. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega; E1960).ChIP-qPCR analysis. Two days after retrovirus infection, AML12 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then neutralized with 125 mM glycine for 5 minutes at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and then lysed with ChIP dilution buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 155 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) containing 1% SDS. The DNA in the cell lysates was fragmented by sonication using a Bioruptor sonicator. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 minutes at 4°C, and the resulting supernatants were further diluted with ChIP dilution buffer. The supernatants were then incubated overnight at 4°C with either the TAZ antibody (MilliporeSigma; HPA007415) or IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The next day, protein A/G beads (Gendepot) were added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 3 hours at 4°C. The beads were then isolated with centrifugation, washed with ChIP wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA), and suspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) for overnight incubation at 65°C. The beads were then removed, and the remaining material was incubated for 2 hours at 55°C with proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and glycogen (20 mg/ml). After a final 1-hour incubation with RNaseA at 37°C, the DNA was purified using standard procedures and analyzed by qPCR using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 1.Gene expression profiling and GSEA. Total RNA was extracted from livers with Ribo-EX (GeneAll) and subjected to microarray analysis with MouseRef-8, version 2.0 BeadChip (Illumina). To identify differentially expressed genes, the raw values from all groups of mice were normalized to the mean values for each gene set and log2 transformed. For the heatmap, the values of 25,697 genes were rank-ordered by their average value for the Pten–/– Sav1–/– samples, and 500 high-rank and 500 low-rank values were selected. The Multi-Experiment Viewer program was used to generate the heatmap, and representative genes from the GO_Insulin receptor signaling pathway, KEGG_Insulin signaling pathway, GO_Glucose homeostasis, Reactom_Metabolism of carbohydrates, or Cordenonsi_YAP conserved signature gene clusters were selected from the Broad Institute's Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB; http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). GSEA was performed using the GenePattern tool from the Broad Institute, with version 5.2 of the Molecular Signature Database libraries (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). Pten–/– Sav1–/– mice were compared with Pten–/– mice, and representative upregulated genes with a nominal P value of less than 0.05 and a FDR q of less than 0.25 are presented.Statistics. Because of individual variation between mice, we used at least 3 to 5 mice per group for all experiments (e.g., immunoblot analyses, qPCR, H&amp;E staining, Oil red O staining, Picrosirius red staining, IHC, etc.). We used only 2 mice per group for the microarray analyses. Group sizes were determined in accordance with previous studies, and no mice were excluded. For the comparison of liver-specific mutant mice with WT mice, we used WT littermates for all experiments. We did not randomize the mouse experiments. The H&amp;E staining experiments and microarray analyses were conducted by researchers who were blinded to the mouse genotypes. All data met the assumptions of each statistical test, and the variations between groups were similar. All in vitro experiments were replicated at least 3 times, except for the luciferase assay, which was replicated 5 times. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM and analyzed using 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test, a 2-tailed Student's t test, or a χ2 test, as appropriate. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All graphs were generated with GraphPad Prism 7.Microarray data availability. Raw expression data for the microarray analyses have been deposited in the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GEO GSE94797).Study approval. Human liver cancer tissue samples were obtained from 56 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection of their liver tumors at the Chungnam National University Hospital between 2000 and 2003. Nine cases of NAFLD-associated HCCs were retrieved from the surgical pathology files of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between 2007 and 2013. HCC samples from these patients were isolated and histologically confirmed. All patients provided written informed consent to undergo therapy and participate in the study. The IRB of Chungnam National University Hospital (IRB nos. 2017-02-026 and B-1704-391-301) approved the experiments. Paraffin blocks for the 56 human liver cancer samples were identified on the corresponding H&amp;E-stained sections. The areas of interest representing HCC were identified and marked on the donor block. Then, 2-mm cores from the areas of interest were transferred to recipient master blocks using the Tissue Microarrayer (Meditech Industries). Animal care and experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines approved by Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.Author contributionsSHJ and DSL conceived the project and wrote the manuscript.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs,"Theory in psychology Maslow's hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid with the more basic needs at the bottom[1]Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper ""A Theory of Human Motivation"" in Psychological Review.[2] Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. He then decided to create a classification system which reflected the universal needs of society as its base and then proceeding to more acquired emotions.[3] Maslow's hierarchy of needs is used to study how humans intrinsically partake in behavioral motivation. Maslow used the terms ""physiological"", ""safety"", ""belonging and love"", ""social needs"" or ""esteem"", and ""self-actualization"" to describe the pattern through which human motivations generally move. This means that in order for motivation to occur at the next level, each level must be satisfied within the individual themselves. Furthermore, this theory is a key foundation in understanding how drive and motivation are correlated when discussing human behavior. Each of these individual levels contains a certain amount of internal sensation that must be met in order for an individual to complete their hierarchy.[3] The goal in Maslow's theory is to attain the fifth level or stage: self-actualization.[4]Maslow's theory was fully expressed in his 1954 book Motivation and Personality.[5] The hierarchy remains a very popular framework in sociology research, management training[6] and secondary and higher psychology instruction. Maslow's classification hierarchy has been revised over time. The original hierarchy states that a lower level must be completely satisfied and fulfilled before moving onto a higher pursuit. However, today scholars prefer to think of these levels as continuously overlapping each other.[3] This means that the lower levels may take precedence back over the other levels at any point in time.Hierarchy[edit] Alternative illustration as a dynamic hierarchy of needs with overlaps of different needs at the same time Maslow's Hierarchy of NeedsMaslow's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top. In other words, the crux of the theory is that individuals' most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher level needs.[1][7]The most fundamental and basic four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called ""deficiency needs"" or ""d-needs"": esteem, friendship and love, security, and physical needs. If these ""deficiency needs"" are not met – with the exception of the most fundamental (physiological) need – there may not be a physical indication, but the individual will feel anxious and tense. Maslow's theory suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire (or focus motivation upon) the secondary or higher level needs. Maslow also coined the term ""metamotivation"" to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment.[8]The human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time, thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow's hierarchy can occur at the same time. Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as ""relative"", ""general"", and ""primarily"". Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time, Maslow stated that a certain need ""dominates"" the human organism.[5] Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met.Physiological needs[edit]Physiological need is a concept that was derived to explain and cultivate the foundation for motivation. This concept is the main physical requirements for human survival. This means that Physiological needs are universal human needs. Physiological needs are considered the first step in internal motivation according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This theory states that humans are compelled to fulfill these physiological needs first in order to pursue intrinsic satisfaction on a higher level.[3] If these needs are not achieved, it leads to an increase in displeasure within an individual. In return, when individuals feel this increase in displeasure, the motivation to decrease these discrepancies increases.[3] Physiological needs can be defined as both traits and a state.[3] Physiological needs as traits allude to long-term, unchanging demands that are required of basic human life. Physiological needs as a state allude to the unpleasant decrease in pleasure and the increase for an incentive to fulfill a necessity.[3] In order to pursue intrinsic motivation higher up Maslow's hierarchy, Physiological needs must be met first. This means that if a human is struggling to meet their physiological needs, then they are unlikely to intrinsically pursue safety, belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization. Physiological needs include:HomeostasisFoodWaterSleepShelter[9]Sex[10]Safety needs[edit]Once a person's physiological needs are relatively satisfied, their safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior. In the absence of physical safety – due to war, natural disaster, family violence, childhood abuse, institutional racism etc. – people may (re-)experience post-traumatic stress disorder or transgenerational trauma. In the absence of economic safety – due to an economic crisis and lack of work opportunities – these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for job security, grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority, savings accounts, insurance policies, disability accommodations, etc. This level is more likely to predominate in children as they generally have a greater need to feel safe. Safety and security needs are about keeping us safe from harm. These include shelter, job security, health, and safe environments. If a person does not feel safe in an environment, they will seek to find safety before they attempt to meet any higher level of survival, but the need for safety is not as important as basic physiological needs.Safety and Security needs include:Social belonging[edit]After physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, the third level of human needs are seen to be interpersonal and involves feelings of belongingness. This need is especially strong in childhood and it can override the need for safety as witnessed in children who cling to abusive parents. Deficiencies within this level of Maslow's hierarchy – due to hospitalism, neglect, shunning, ostracism, etc. – can adversely affect the individual's ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships in general.Social Belonging needs include:According to Maslow, humans need to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups, regardless of whether these groups are large or small. For example, some large social groups may include clubs, co-workers, religious groups, professional organizations, sports teams, gangs, and online communities. Some examples of small social connections include family members, intimate partners, mentors, colleagues, and confidants. Humans need to love and be loved – both sexually and non-sexually – by others.[2] Many people become susceptible to loneliness, social anxiety, and clinical depression in the absence of this love or belonging element. This need for belonging may overcome the physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure.Self-esteem[edit]Esteem needs are ego needs or status needs. People develop a concern with getting recognition, status, importance, and respect from others. Most humans have a need to feel respected; this includes the need to have self-esteem and self-respect. Esteem presents the typical human desire to be accepted and valued by others. People often engage in a profession or hobby to gain recognition. These activities give the person a sense of contribution or value. Low self-esteem or an inferiority complex may result from imbalances during this level in the hierarchy. People with low self-esteem often need respect from others; they may feel the need to seek fame or glory. However, fame or glory will not help the person to build their self-esteem until they accept who they are internally. Psychological imbalances such as depression can distract the person from obtaining a higher level of self-esteem.Most people have a need for stable self-respect and self-esteem. Maslow noted two versions of esteem needs: a ""lower"" version and a ""higher"" version. The ""lower"" version of esteem is the need for respect from others. This may include a need for status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention. The ""higher"" version manifests itself as the need for self-respect. For example, the person may have a need for strength, competence[3], mastery, self-confidence, independence, and freedom. This ""higher"" version takes guidelines, the ""hierarchies are interrelated rather than sharply separated"".[5] This means that esteem and the subsequent levels are not strictly separated; instead, the levels are closely related.Self-actualization[edit]""What a man can be, he must be.""[5]:91 This quotation forms the basis of the perceived need for self-actualization. This level of need refers to what a person's full potential is and the realization of that potential. Maslow describes this level as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be.[5]:92 Individuals may perceive or focus on this need very specifically. For example, one individual may have a strong desire to become an ideal parent. In another, the desire may be expressed athletically. For others, it may be expressed in paintings, pictures, or inventions.[5]:93 As previously mentioned, Maslow believed that to understand this level of need, the person must not only achieve the previous needs but master them. Self-actualization can often be described as a value-based system when discussing its role in motivation. Since all levels of Maslow's hierarchy must have been met in order to acquire this level, seeking to fulfill this form of satisfaction can be defined as an explicit motive. An explicit motive can be defined as a reward-based system that is used to intrinsically pursue certain values or goals.[3] Individuals who are motivated to pursue this level are seeking and understanding how their sense of self-partakes within their human behavior. Self-actualization can include:[3]Mate AcquisitionParentingUtilizing AbilitiesUtilizing TalentsPursuing a goalSeeking HappinessTranscendence[edit]In his later years, Abraham Maslow explored a further dimension of motivation, while criticizing his original vision of self-actualization.[11][12][13][14] By this later theory, one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself—for example, in altruism or spirituality. He equated this with the desire to reach the infinite.[15] ""Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos"" (Farther Reaches of Human Nature, New York 1971, p. 269).Research[edit]Recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs, although the hierarchy proposed by Maslow is called into question.[16][17]Following World War II, the unmet needs of homeless and orphaned children presented difficulties that were often addressed with the help of attachment theory, which was initially based on Maslow and others' developmental psychology work by John Bowlby.[18] Originally dealing primarily with maternal deprivation and concordant losses of essential and primal needs, attachment theory has since been extended to provide explanations of nearly all the human needs in Maslow's hierarchy, from sustenance and mating to group membership and justice.[19]Criticism[edit]Unlike most scientific theories, Maslow's hierarchy of needs has widespread influence outside academia. As Uriel Abulof argues, ""The continued resonance of Maslow's theory in popular imagination, however unscientific it may seem, is possibly the single most telling evidence of its significance: it explains human nature as something that most humans immediately recognize in themselves and others.""[20] Still, academically, Maslow's theory is heavily contested.Methodology[edit]Maslow studied what he called the master race of people such as Albert Einstein, Jane Addams, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Frederick Douglass rather than mentally ill or neurotic people, writing that ""the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy.""[5]:236Maslow studied the healthiest 1% of the college student population.[21]Ranking[edit]Global ranking[edit]In their extensive review of research based on Maslow's theory, Wahba and Bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all.[22]The order in which the hierarchy is arranged has been criticized as being ethnocentric by Geert Hofstede.[23] Maslow's hierarchy of needs fails to illustrate and expand upon the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in individualistic societies and those raised in collectivist societies. The needs and drives of those in individualistic societies tend to be more self-centered than those in collectivist societies, focusing on improvement of the self, with self-actualization being the apex of self-improvement. In collectivist societies, the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality.[24]Ranking of sex[edit]The position and value of sex on the pyramid has also been a source of criticism regarding Maslow's hierarchy. Maslow's hierarchy places sex in the physiological needs category along with food and breathing; it lists sex solely from an individualistic perspective. For example, sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers ""higher"" levels of motivation. Some critics feel this placement of sex neglects the emotional, familial, and evolutionary implications of sex within the community, although others point out that this is true of all of the basic needs.[25][26]Changes to the hierarchy by circumstance[edit]The higher-order (self-esteem and self-actualization) and lower-order (physiological, safety, and love) needs classification of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country.In one study,[27] exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of a thirteen item scale showed there were two particularly important levels of needs in the US during the peacetime of 1993 to 1994: survival (physiological and safety) and psychological (love, self-esteem, and self-actualization). In 1991, a retrospective peacetime measure was established and collected during the Persian Gulf War and US citizens were asked to recall the importance of needs from the previous year. Once again, only two levels of needs were identified; therefore, people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs. For citizens in the Middle East (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), three levels of needs regarding importance and satisfaction surfaced during the 1990 retrospective peacetime. These three levels were completely different from those of the US citizens.Changes regarding the importance and satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, there was only one level of needs since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime.[28][29]A 1981 study looked at how Maslow's hierarchy might vary across age groups.[30] A survey asked participants of varying ages to rate a set number of statements from most important to least important. The researchers found that children had higher physical need scores than the other groups, the love need emerged from childhood to young adulthood, the esteem need was highest among the adolescent group, young adults had the highest self-actualization level, and old age had the highest level of security, it was needed across all levels comparably. The authors argued that this suggested Maslow's hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age.Definition of terms[edit]Self-actualization[edit]The term ""self-actualization"" may not universally convey Maslow's observations; this motivation refers to focusing on becoming the best person that one can possibly strive for in the service of both the self and others.[5][non-primary source needed] Maslow's term of self-actualization might not properly portray the full extent of this level; quite often, when a person is at the level of self-actualization, much of what they accomplish in general may benefit others, or ""the greater good"".[original research?]Human or non-human needs[edit]Abulof argues that while Maslow stresses that ""motivation theory must be anthropocentric rather than animalcentric,"" his theory erects a largely animalistic pyramid, crowned with a human edge: ""Man's higher nature rests upon man's lower nature, needing it as a foundation and collapsing without this foundation… Our godlike qualities rest upon and need our animal qualities."" Abulof notes that ""all animals seek survival and safety, and many animals, especially mammals, also invest efforts to belong and gain esteem... The first four of Maslow's classical five rungs feature nothing exceptionally human.""[31] Even when it comes to ""self-actualization,"" Abulof argues, it is unclear how distinctively human is the actualizing ""self."" After all, the latter, according to Maslow, constitutes ""an inner, more biological, more instinctoid core of human nature,"" thus ""the search for one's own intrinsic, authentic values"" checks the human freedom of choice: ""A musician must make music,"" so freedom is limited to merely the choice of instrument.[31]See also[edit]References[edit]^ a b Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs[dead link]^ a b Maslow, A.H.

In such case although the production of insulin is enough in amount but the cells in our body becomes resistant to insulin and stops the entry of insulin into the cell. Being overweight stresses the insides of individual cells. Specifically, too much of eating stresses the membranous network inside cells known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER). once the ER has a lot more nutrients to process than it can handle, it sends out alarm signal telling the cell to dampen down the hypoglycemic agent receptors on the cell surface. This interprets to hypoglycemic agent resistance and to persistently high concentrations of the sugar aldohexose within the blood. This is one of the confirming signs of diabetes.Diabetes and EndocrinologyThe human body secretes hormones to maintain the chemical balance in the body in order to run our body smoothly. These hormones are released in our body by some glands that are considered to be the part of the endocrine system. The major endocrine organs present in our body include pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenalin gland, ovaries, testes and pancreas.In diabetes patients the main problem that incurs due to the endocrine system is the hormone imbalance. This is because of the lack or excessive secretion of the hormone from their respective gland. But diabetes is majorly a pancreatic disorder that is incurred due to irregular release of Insulinvar Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();(function(){var s1=document.createElement(""script""),s0=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];s1.async=true;s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5cbdc118d6e05b735b43b268/default';s1.charset='UTF-8';s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);})();var Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();(function(){var s1=document.createElement(""script""),s0=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];s1.async=true;s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5c3f11e351410568a106e0f6/default';s1.charset='UTF-8';s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);})();Endocrinology and MetabolismEndocrinology is the study of the endocrine system in the body. This is a system of glands which secrete hormones .Humans have over 50 different hormones. They exist in small amounts and still have a significant impact on bodily function and development. Hormones regulate metabolism, respiration, growth, reproduction, sensory perception and movement. Hormone imbalances are the underlying reason for a wide range of medical conditions. Endocrinology focuses on both the hormones and the glands and tissues that produce them.Diabetes and Metabolic DisordersThe metabolism of people with diabetes is almost identical to the metabolism of people without diabetes. The only difference is the volume or effectiveness of the insulin produced by the body. In type 2 diabetes, the effectiveness of insulin is reduced and in type 1 diabetes, insulin levels in the body are very low but the proper functioning of metabolism is reliant on the delivery of insulin. This can be done with introduction of external insulin to the body with the help of injection or pump.Pancreatitis and InsulinThe pancreas is academic degree organ placed behind the lower a vicinity of the abdomen, above the spine and plays a really a vital role in diabetes. The pancreas is that the organ that produces the insulin, one the foremost hormones that helps to manage hexose or the blood sugar glucose levels by aiding the transport of aldohexose from the blood into neighboring cells. The cells that manufacture the insulin are known as beta cells. Endocrine Glands and HormonesEndocrine disorders can be classified according to the intensity of hormonal activity and according to the origin of endocrine disorder. From the intensity of hormonal activity of endocrine gland we can distinguish hyper function of endocrine gland, which is characterized by increased secretion of its hormone as well as by increased concentration of this hormone in circulating blood.Clinical Researches in Diabetes (Trials and Case studies)Clinical researches / clinical trials are approaches to precisely test medication or gadget in patients before it is endorsed by the FDA to be utilized in public. Clinical trials are an important and critical step in our having the capacity to have new medications for diabetes and other varied conditions. A case study is a methodology and a strategy that investigates a phenomenon with its real-life context. Case studies and clinical trials are used to develop or assess the quality of the medications being developed.Cardiovascular issues in DiabetesCardiovascular diseases affects the circulation of blood and poor circulation leads to complications. Diabetes increases the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Reports states, most of the people with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes are having high blood pressure. These complications embrace coronary cardiopathy (CHD), stroke, peripheral blood vessel malady, renal disorder, retinopathy, and probably pathology. Attributable to the aging of the population and an increasing prevalence of obesity and inactive life habits within the prevalence of diabetes is increasing. 68% of people age 65 or older with diabetes die from some of the heart diseases and 16% die of stroke. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than adults without diabetes.Nanotechnology in Diabetes TreatmentNanotechnology holds a great deal of promise for the world of medicine. It is likely that some of the first truly revolutionary changes noticeable in our everyday lives will be brought about by Nano-medicine. the possibilities of Nano-medicine include Nano formulations for efficient drug delivery, smart drugs which only activate when needed, engineered microbes which produce human hormones.Diabetic Nephropathy and UrineDiabetic nephropathy (DN), also known as diabetic kidney disease, is the chronic loss of kidney function occurring in those with diabetes mellitus. Protein loss in the urine due to damage to the glomeruli may become massive, and cause a low serum albumin with resulting generalized body swelling (edema) and result in the nephrotic syndrome. Likewise, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may progressively fall from a normal of over 90 ml/min/1.73m2 to less than 15, at which point the patient is said to have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It usually is slowly progressive over years.Bariatric SurgeryBariatric surgical procedures cause weight loss by restricting the amount of food the stomach can hold, causing malabsorption of nutrients, or by a combination of both gastric restriction and malabsorption. Bariatric procedures also often cause hormonal changes. Most weight loss surgeries today are performed using minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic surgery). The basic principle of bariatric surgery is to restrict food intake and decrease the absorption of food in the stomach and intestines.Pediatric Diabetes and EndocrinologyPediatric or juvenile diabetes is chronic type 1 diabetes which affects the young population, particularly children under the age of 15. Such diabetes brings about lifetime dependency on exogenous insulin. Signs and symptoms of pediatric diabetes are like other types of diabetes and children are more likely to develop the disease if there is a family history of diabetes. Complications of pediatric diabetes also generally include heart diseases, nerve damage, nerve, kidney and eye damage, skin conditions, osteoporosis, etc. Proper diagnosis, treatment and management are the possible remedies for this type of diabetes.Pediatric Endocrinology is a subspecialty of pediatrics dealing with metabolic and endocrine disorders in children. The most common disease of the speciality is type 1 diabetes , which usually accounts for at least 50% of a typical clinical practice. The next most common problem is growth disorders , especially those amenable to growth hormone treatment. Pediatric endocrinologists are usually the primary physicians involved in the medical care of infants and children with intersex disorders. It also deals with hypoglycaemia and other forms of hyperglycemia in childhood, variations of puberty as well other adrenal, thyroid and pituitary problems.Physiotherapy in diabetesDiabetes became a serious and deadly disease mainly because of obesity and poor lifestyle. Although diabetes can be prevented, treated, controlled, and the risk lessened via various health and lifestyle interventions like physiotherapy. Physiotherapy can be used wisely to diagnosis, treat, and manage musculoskeletal (MSK) manifestations and complications of type 2 diabetes. Physiotherapy mehods like effective exercise, physical conditioning, and active, healthy living can be effective in treating diabetes Stem Cell Therapy in DiabetesIn most cases of stem cell therapy, using one's own stem cells is more more helpful for the exocrine gland to regenerate and boost its ability to produce insulin. Procedure continues to achieve success, with patients experiencing health advantages even six months after stem cell diabetes treatment. Repeated applications of adipose stem cells is one of the most effective treatment for type two diabetes, providing an open window to create dietary changes, supplementation and exercise much more effective for long-term management of blood glucose. Diabetic RetinopathyDiabetic retinopathy is a condition or disease of eye that is found in patients with Diabetes. This can be once high blood glucose levels cause injury to blood vessels within the membrane. These blood vessels will swell and leak. Or they'll shut, stopping blood from passing through. generally abnormal new blood vessels grow on the membrane. All of those changes will steal your vision.Cardiovascular risks in obeseObesity not only increases the cardiovascular risks but it damages more than just the heart and blood system. It is also the major cause of bile stones, osteoarthritis and respiratory problems. Obesity closely interferes with many health conditions that underlie cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, diabetes and abnormal blood cholesterol. Additionally, weight gain is a frequent consequence of a heart-damaging lifestyle such as lack of exercise and a fat diet. Obesity can also lead to Cardiac arrest. This is a serious condition when the heart is unable to pump enough amount of blood to satisfy the body's requirement. Obesity and Metabolic syndromeObesity is dirctly or indirctly linked to some endocrine diseases, including basic ones such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovarian syndrome to rare ones such as Cushing's syndrome, central hypothyroidism, and hypothalamic disorders. Mechanisms to upgrade weight shift in as per endocrine condition. Hypothyroidism is related to the combination of hyaluronic acid in different tissues, extra liquid preservation due to reduced cardiovascular yield and reduced thermogenesis. The net abundance of androgen gives the impression of being urgent in the progression of central obesity. In Cushing's syndrome, association with thyroid and developmental hormones plays a significant part in increasing adipocyte separation and adipogenesis. This audit also depicts remaining rare cases: hypothalamic obesity due to central hypothyroidism and combined hormone deficiencies.Diabetes and cancerDiabetes and cancer are two of the biggest threats with tremendous impact to humans during this decade. However scientists are yet to prove a relation between the two. Recent studies show some evidences however not definite proofs that some diabetes treatment methods increases the danger of cancer. Instances from the recent studies includes anti-diabetics, the foremost usually used anti-diabetic drug, appears to lower cancer risk. however there is conjointly proof from some studies conducted by others that hypoglycemic agent, notably long hypoglycemic agent glargine (Lantus), could increase cancer risk. Diabetes in young adultsResearches states that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are on the rise among young adults. Current estimates suggest that up to 3 million youth and adults in the United States are living with type 1 diabetes . A report on Diabetes in Youth found that newly diagnosed cases of Type 2 diabetes in children and teens increased by about 4.8 percent in each year of the study's period between 2002 and 2012. Gestational Diabetes The short term occurrence of diabetes in pregnant ladies is majorly known as Gestational diabetes. It is seen in non- diabetic mothers suddenly develops diabetes during pregnancy and the symptoms disappears after the baby's birth.Diabetic NeuropathyThe damage caused to nerves by diabetes is called Diabetic neuropathy. The main cause of this damage is the pressure generated due to high blood glucose levels in the blood for a very long time and high levels of fats, such as triglycerides in the blood. Symptoms vary with the type of diabetic neuropathy.Mainly diabetic neuropathy is divided into 4 types namely;Peripheral neuropathyAutonomic neuropathyRadiculoplexus neuropathyMononeuropathyDiabetes and DementiaDementia being called the disorder due to a result of trauma or brain illness can be connected to diabetes mellitus as mentioned in some of the studies. Although not much is known about the connection between dementia and diabetes mellitus. Dementia is the term used to specify the mind disease where the capacity recall and to think diminish along. These brain diseases affect capacity and a person's rituals to execute. The changes is unnoticeable and small, but becomes severe. The case arises when diseases like strokes or Alzheimers impact the mind. Even though Alzheimers has been counted as the most important reason behind dementia, other potential cases to remain.Diabetes Wound CareWound healing gets slow in diabetic patients due to a number of factors such as High blood sugar levels (When your blood sugar level is higher than normal, it prevents nutrients and oxygen from energizing cells which prevents your immune system from functioning efficiently and eventually increases inflammation in the body's cells. Diabetes ManagementAlong with prevention and treatment, management is very important and plays a crucial role in diabetes. . Management of diabetes mainly aims to minimize the risk of long-term consequences associated with diabetes. It not only involves keeping a check on blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels but also focusing on modern approaches like exercise, dietary and lifestyle management often coupled with on-going blood glucose level monitoring. Besides this, self-management of diabetes is also very crucial for the proper adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications.Diabetes and Mental HealthUntreated mental state problems can make diabetes worse, and issues with diabetes will build mental state problems worse. however if one starts recovering, the other will start recovering too. The main set of mental health problems in Diabetes includes-Latest Techniques In Diabetes DiagnosisThe concept of 'new technologies' for type 1 diabetes and new discovery and advanced type 2 diabetes treatment has expanded in recent years at a rate that some might consider comparable to 'Moore's Law', and the sheer number of new technologies entering into the type 1 diabetes marketplace is also growing at a remarkable rate. From the patient's perspective, this is not only exciting but can lead to a sense of optimism. Technologies that today are growing commonplace. come under new therapeutic mechanisms of diabetes. Indeed, it could be argued that the major advances in type 1 diabetes care made within the last quarter of a century have come from technology rather than biology. Previous Conference ReportEuroscicon conference ""3rd World Congress on Diabetes and Obesity"" formally Diabetes Conference 2019 was held in Holiday inn Rome Aurelia | Rome, Italy during 18-19 March, 2019 with active participation of professional researchers, scientists involved in the development of high-quality education &amp; research in all aspects.Diabetes Conference 2019 witnessed an amalgamation of peerless speakers who enlightened the crowd with their knowledge and confabulated on various topics related to the field of Diabetes and Obesity.

We take immense pleasure to get the opportunity to host the next edition of our congress in during November 06-07, 2019 in Chicago, USA. This time we have planned to organize a better and bigger congress that will include various aspects of researches that left unfocussed in our last edition.Let us meet again @chicago Market ResearchAs per the studies conducted recently, there are more than twenty-seven million diabetes patients within the U.S.A., thus world's third largest country in terms of diabetes patients in 2018. The major reasons behind these prevailing cases of diabetes is the rise of obesity levels associated with the increasing aging population. It's been found in the studies conducted that over half the U.S.A. population is either obese or overweight that is especially because of their inactive lifestyles, physical inactivities and unhealthy consumption habits. Moreover, the aging population within the U.S.A. has been on the increase since the 1960's. individuals aged sixty five years and on top of accounted for around 11th of September of the overall population in 1960 whereas in 2018, this cohort accounted for around 15 August 1945 of the whole U.S.A. population. Driven by rising incidences of polygenic disorder and therefore the incontrovertible fact that the U.S.A. has one amongst the very best per capita tending expenditures, the U.S.A. marketplace for polygenic disorder medication has grownup at a CAGR of around eleven.8% throughout 2011-2018, reaching a price of US$ forty five.4 Billion in 2018.Diabetes has increasingly become a lifestyle related disease as it afflicts young and old. As the number of patients grow across the globe, there has never been a stronger and more urgent need for novel therapeutic measures in clinical and preclinical evaluation, that arrest the growth of the disease. The diabetes market, consisting mainly of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is large and growing significantly. Global diabetes market is expected to grow at CAGR of 7.6% for the forecasted period of 2018-2023.the market is segmented on the basis of type of diabetes, drugs class and diabetic devices. Diabetic drugs have the highest market share amongst drugs and devices and are also expected to have the highest growth rate with a CAGR of 8.9% . some of the top selling diabetic drugs include Lantus(sanofi), Januvia(Merck and Co), Humalog(Eli Lily And Co),Novo rapid(Novo Nordisk),Levemir(Novo Nordisk),Victoza(Novo Nordisk),Janumet(Merck And Co),Novolog(Novo Nordisk),Humalin (Eli Lily And Co) and Galvus (Novartis).with the diabetic population expected to cross the 350 million market by 2030 the market is expected to show strong growth rate. Diabetic drugs are highly priced which could be one of the major drawbacks.Diabetes drug research market in Europe is expected to progress with a 5.08% CAGR over the forecast years of 2018-2026. It is the second largest market for diabetes drugs. High blood glucose kills about 3.4 million people annually worldwide. Approximately 80% of these deaths take place in underdeveloped and developing countries, and almost half are people aged less than 70 years. As per recent research in WHO diabetic deaths will double between 2005 and 2030. India had 69.2 million people living with diabetes (8.7%) in 2015. About 90% of the patients are suffering from Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Research Market is expected to grow at the average CAGR of 6.5% time period of 2016-2023. India's Diabetes Market is growing rapidly. India is expected to grow US$ 7441.6 million by 2023 from US$ 4778.7 million in 2016. The data varies from $263 billion spent in North America to $147 billion in Europe and Northern Asia. Followed by China, Mongolia, South East Asia and Oceania with a total of $88 billion. Why Chicago?As per reports, over 1,300,000 people in Illinois have diabetes or 12.8% of the population. Illinoisans are increasingly feeling the effects of diabetes. In 2018, reports states USA as third largest country worldwide in terms of diabetes patients.

Eighty patients with metabolic syndrome treated in Linyi Central Hospital from January 2017 to December 2017 were selected and divided into control group (n=40) and observation group (n=40). Patients in control group were treated with regular therapy using the Western medicine and drugs, while those in observation group, based on the treatment in control group, were treated with berberine. Changes in relevant indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups. The correlation of inflammatory factor with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, triglyceride and total cholesterol was analyzed. At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance index and blood lipid indexes in both groups were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05). At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance index and blood lipid indexes in observation group were significantly lower than those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in both groups at 1 month after treatment were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05), and they were lower in observation group at 1 month after treatment than those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05). Finally, hs-CRP was positively correlated with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride. The combined application of berberine in patients with metabolic syndrome can effectively regulate blood glucose and blood lipid of patients, alleviate insulin resistance and reduce the level of inflammatory response in the body.Keywords: berberine, metabolic syndrome, blood glucose metabolism, blood lipid metabolism, inflammatory factors, insulin resistanceIntroductionMetabolic syndrome mainly refers to a group of pathophysiological changes based on insulin resistance (1), the major clinical manifestations are central obesity, increase in blood glucose, increase in blood lipid and increase in blood pressure, seriously affecting the physical health of patients. The above clinical manifestations of metabolic syndrome, as a metabolic dysfunction-related disease (2), have certain common risk factors, which are in line with the 'concept of holism, homotherapy for heteropathy' in the traditional Chinese medicine. It is of important significance to effectively intervene in patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, and endocrine diseases (like type 2 diabetes mellitus) (3), alleviate or avoid the occurrence of insulin resistance and make full use of the concept of 'preventive treatment of disease', namely 'prevention before disease onset, prevention of disease from exacerbating', in the traditional Chinese medicine, thereby increasing the therapeutic effect on metabolic syndrome and improving the prognosis of patients (4).Berberine, also known as Berberine hydrochloride in clinic, is the isoquinoline alkaloid, an active ingredient extracted from Chinese herbal medicines, such as Coptis chinensis and Phellodendron amurense, which has dominant advantages such as reducing blood glucose, and regulating blood lipid and vascular endothelial cells (5). In recent years, berberine has been widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia (6). With the deepening of fundamental research on berberine, it has been confirmed that the main mechanisms of berberine in reducing blood glucose and blood pressure and regulating blood lipid are promotion of insulin secretion and improvement of the body's insulin resistance (7). To better investigate the clinical value of berberine in the treatment of metabolic syndrome, this study was performed from the perspectives of blood glucose, blood lipid, insulin resistance and inflammatory factor levels.Patients and methodsPatient data A total of 80 patients with metabolic syndrome treated in Linyi Central Hospital (Linyi, China) from January 2017 to December 2017 were selected. All patients met the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese Medical Association (8) for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Before enrollment, patients signed an informed consent, and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Linyi Central Hospital. Patients enrolled were aged 60–80 years, and they were physically healthy in the past. Exclusion criteria: i) Patients complicated with other endocrine system diseases, mental diseases, malignant tumor or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ii) patients who were illiterate, allergic to drugs applied or could not pay the medical expenses. Patients were divided into two groups with 40 cases in each group using the random number method. There were no statistically significant differences in comparisons of general data and related indexes between the two groups (P&gt;0.05) ().Table I.Comparison of general data and related indexes between the two groups (mean ± SD).GroupSex (male/female)Age (years)Fasting blood glucose (mmol/l)2 h postprandial blood glucose (mmol/l)Insulin resistanceObservation group20/2065.6±1.810.5±0.613.5±1.31.5±0.1Control group20/2065.5±1.810.6±0.613.6±1.31.5±0.1χ2 or t value&lt;0.0010.2480.7450.344&lt;0.001P-value&gt;0.050.8040.4580.732&gt;0.05ContinuedGroupTriglyceride (mmol/l)Total cholesterol (mmol/l)Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (ng/l)Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (ng/l)High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (ml/l)Observation group2.53±0.136.11±0.090.69±0.05253.1±2.125.6±1.3Control group2.55±0.136.12±0.100.70±0.05253.6±2.025.7±1.4χ2 or t value0.6880.4700.8941.0900.331P-value0.4930.6400.3740.2790.742Methods Patients in control group were treated with regular therapy using the Western medicine and drugs strictly in accordance with the treatment guidelines of metabolic syndrome of the Chinese Medical Association. First of all, the weight of patients was reduced, the diet adjustment was strengthened, and the body mass index ≤28. Patients exercised properly according to the body's tolerance, and it was recommended that they take part in light-moderate physical activity every day for half an hour. In addition, the insulin resistance was reduced, in other words, the blood glucose-regulating drugs, such as metformin and insulin sensitizing drug thiazolidinedione, were applied while diet and exercise interventions were performed. At the same time, the intervention in hyperlipidemia was also performed, and it was advised that fibrates and statins be applied. Finally, the patient's blood pressure was adjusted and controlled within 130/80 mmHg. In terms of antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) were preferred choices. Patients in observation group, based on the treatment in control group, were treated with berberine (Jiangxi Sinopharm Co., Ltd., Jiangxi, China, NMPN Z36020766) 3 times a day (4 tablets/time).Observation indexes All patients were followed up for 1 month. Changes in relevant indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment. The correlations of inflammatory factor hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, triglyceride and total cholesterol were analyzed.Evaluation criteria Related detection indexes to blood glucose included fasting blood glucose (3.9–6.1 mmol/l), 2 h postprandial blood glucose (≤7.8 mmol/l) and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [reference value: 1, calculation formula: fasting blood glucose (mmol/l) × fasting insulin (mU/l)]. Related indexes to blood lipid included triglyceride (0.56–1.71 mmol/l) and total cholesterol (2.83–5.17 mmol/l). Inflammation-related factors included hs-CRP (&lt;10 ml/l), IL-6 (0.37–0.46 ng/l) and TNF-α (5–100 ng/l).Statistical analysis SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Measurement data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (mean ±SD). Student's t-test was used for the comparison of related indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms between the two groups at different observation points, the Chi-square test (χ2) was used for the comparison of adverse reactions between the two groups, and correlations of hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride were analyzed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient method. The procedure was repeated 3 times. P&lt;0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsChanges in related indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose and insulin resistance index in both groups were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05), and levels of blood lipid indexes (triglyceride and total cholesterol) were also lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05). At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose and insulin resistance index in observation group were significantly decreased compared with those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05), and levels of blood lipid indexes (triglyceride and total cholesterol) were also lowered compared with those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05) ().Table II.Changes in related indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment (mean ± SD).GroupTreatmentFasting blood glucose (mmol/l)2 h postprandial blood glucose (mmol/l)Insulin resistanceTriglyceride (mmol/l)Total cholesterol (mmol/l)Observation group1 week after treatment7.9±0.39.9±0.51.3±0.12.12±0.085.39±0.151 month after treatment5.6±0.2a,b7.5±0.3a,b1.1±0.11a,b1.56±0.07a,b3.69±0.08a,bControl group1 week after treatment8.0±0.410.0±0.51.4±0.12.13±0.095.40±0.161 month after treatment6.5±0.3a8.5±0.61a1.3±0.11a1.96±0.061a5.23±0.101at140.34526.0328.94433.31862.129p1&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001t218.97412.1474.4729.9405.698p2&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001t315.7879.4288.94427.44076.055p3&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001Changes in inflammatory factors in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment Levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α in both groups at 1 month after treatment were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05), and they were lower in observation group at 1 month after treatment than those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05) ().Table III.Changes in inflammatory factors in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment (mean ± SD).GroupTreatmenths-CRP (ml/l)IL-6 (ng/l)TNF-α (ng/l)Observation group1 week after treatment12.3±0.50.59±0.06136.8±11.11 month after treatment8.5±0.3a,b0.43±0.04a,b83.2±7.6a,bControl group1 week after treatment14.6±0.60.68±0.06146.5±11.31 month after treatment11.6±0.4a0.51±0.05a108.9±8.3at141.21714.03325.199p1&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001t226.31213.76616.961p2&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001t339.2127.90214.443p3&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001Correlation analysis of inflammatory factor hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose There was a positive correlation between inflammatory factor hs-CRP and fasting blood glucose (r=0.9242, P&lt;0.05) ().Correlation analysis of inflammatory factor hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose.

Patients have symptoms including central obesity, atherosclerosis, rise of blood lipid, pathoglycemia and elevation of blood pressure, which may be accompanied by microalbuminuria, hyperuricemia and long-term rise of chronic inflammatory cytokines (10). Currently, most scholars consider that insulin resistance is the most crucial independent risk factor and central link that lead to metabolic syndrome (11). Treatment for metabolic syndrome is based on improvement of patients' way of life, regulation of eating habits, exercise training and loss of weight, combined with drug therapy of reducing blood lipid and regulating blood pressure and blood glucose (12). Berberine can regulate various metabolic disorders of metabolic syndrome, which has advantages of wide medicinal herbs resources, low price, smaller adverse reactions, and is also safe and convenient (13).In this study, patients with metabolic syndrome in control group were given regular Western medicine treatment strictly following guideline requirements, while those in observation group received berberine treatment on the basis of that in control group. By analyzing changes of related indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms in the groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment, it was found that related indexes to blood glucose and lipid in both groups were improved at 1 month after treatment, but levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose and insulin resistance index in observation group were significantly lower than those in control group at 1 month after treatment, and levels of blood lipid indexes (triglyceride and total cholesterol) in observation group were lower than those in control group at 1 month after treatment, indicating that combined use of berberine can regulate blood glucose and blood lipid levels more effectively and lighten insulin resistance. By exploring changes in relevant indexes of inflammatory factors in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment, it was found that hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α levels in both groups were also lower than those at 1 week after treatment, but hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α levels in observation group were all lower than those in control group at 1 month after treatment, indicating that combined use of berberine tablets is of important significance for reducing inflammatory reaction in patients with metabolic syndrome. From the correlation research on inflammatory response factor hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride, it was revealed that hs-CRP was positively related to fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride, which further indicates that there is chronic inflammatory response in the body of patients with metabolic syndrome and the severity degree of inflammatory response is related to blood glucose and blood lipid metabolism. Chronic inflammatory response may also lead to increase of insulin resistance in the body and further worsen the disease condition. Besides, combined use of berberine tablets did not increase the incidence of adverse reactions of treatment, so combined use of berberine tablets is of high safety.In this study, combined use of berberine could effectively improve activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) of islet cells, thus promoting activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) signal pathway (14) and active secretion of insulin in the body. Moreover, berberine can also stimulate free fatty acid to induce secretion of insulin (15). Berberine improves physiological stimulation of glucose via cascade reaction of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), thus inducing secretion of insulin in the body, reducing insulin resistance, and improving sensitivity of liver, muscle tissues and fat to insulin (16). Berberine can improve the activity and promote the proliferation of insulin β cells (17). Therefore, the combined use of berberine in observation group could better control fasting blood glucose and 2 h postprandial plasma glucose and reduce insulin resistance in the body. Berberine inhibits synthesis and secretion of proteolipid protein and activity of peroxisome by enhancing low density lipoprotein receptor level and promoting adenylate-phosphoric acid-activated protein kinase activity, thus regulating blood lipid and inhibiting proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes, so as to achieve the objective of reducing free fatty acid in serum (18,19). Consequently, triglyceride and total cholesterol decreased significantly after combined use of berberine in observation group. In addition, berberine can also evidently decrease levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines in the body (20), improve calcium overload and ischemia reperfusion injury and provide anti-oxidative capacity (21).In conclusion, combined use of berberine for patients with metabolic syndrome can effectively regulate blood glucose and lipid, lighten insulin resistance in the body and reduce inflammatory response level.FundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsCC wrote the manuscript and collected the general data.

Age‐associated cholesterol reduction triggers brain insulin resistance by facilitating ligand‐independent receptor activation and pathway desensitization - Martín‐Segura - 2019 - Aging Cell - Wiley Online Library,"1 INTRODUCTION Brain insulin has been traditionally associated with important roles in the organism: regulation of appetite, body temperature, response to hypoglycemia, and others (Kleinridders, Ferris, Cai, &amp; Kahn, 2014). In addition, recent studies strongly indicate a central role for insulin in cognitive processes and the underlying synaptic processes (Biessels &amp; Reagan, 2015; Haj‐ali, Mohaddes, &amp; Babri, 2009; Moosavi, Naghdy, &amp; Choopani, 2007). Thus, insulin modulates long‐term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region (Grillo et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2012; Nisticó et al., 2012) and can induce on its own, that is, without the need of further electrical stimuli, hippocampal long‐term depression (LTD; hereinafter referred to as insulin‐LTD; Ahmadian et al., 2004; Huang, Lee, &amp; Hsu, 2004; Man et al., 2000). LTD is increasingly recognized as a second main form of synaptic plasticity that is important for learning and memory (Collingridge, Peineau, Howland, &amp; Wang, 2010; Ge et al., 2010; Kemp &amp; Manahan‐Vaughan, 2007). This also provides, at least in part, the rationale for the role of brain insulin in the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the clinical impact of intranasal insulin administration on mood and memory recall (Benedict et al., 2007; Carro, Trejo, Gomez‐Isla, LeRoith, &amp; Torres‐Aleman, 2002; Freiherr et al., 2013). Aging affects insulin and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF‐1) signaling (Fernandes, Saad, &amp; Velloso, 2001; Frölich et al., 1998). Clinical and preclinical studies have shown a reduction of insulin and IGF‐1 receptors, their message, and their function in the hippocampus during normal and pathological aging (Deak &amp; Sonntag, 2012; Talbot &amp; Wang, 2014; Zaia &amp; Piantanelli, 2000). Altered brain insulin signaling in the old often accompanies peripheral insulin resistance due to metabolic deregulation in type 2 diabetes (T2D; Biessels &amp; Reagan, 2015; Bruehl et al., 2009) or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD; Talbot et al., 2012). However, brain insulin resistance also develops independently of T2D or AD (Steculorum et al., 2014) and it remains unclear how normal aging can induce these alterations. Here, we propose that the brain insulin signaling deficit with age is the consequence of the changes in the lipid composition of the neuronal plasma membrane that occurs with natural aging (Martín, Pfrieger, &amp; Dotti, 2014). We envision that changes in lipid content will lead to a reorganization of plasma membrane receptors and receptor‐associated scaffold resulting in signaling alterations of diverse pathways, including the insulin pathway. A number of observations support this prediction. First, several cell types of diabetic individuals present changes in the ratios of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and saturated fatty acids (reviewed in Pilon, 2016). Second, the hippocampi of old rodents and humans present significant changes in lipid composition, particularly a reduction in cholesterol (Colin et al., 2016; Haughey, Bandaru, Bae, &amp; Mattson, 2010; Svennerholm, Boström, Jungbjer, &amp; Olsson, 1994). Third, the decrease in neuronal cholesterol has also been observed in murine models of T2D (Suzuki et al., 2010; Suzuki, Ferris, Chee, Maratos‐Flier, &amp; Kahn, 2013). In support of a cause–effect relationship, two recent studies have shown that the mild reduction of cholesterol in the hippocampus is involved in the cognitive deficits of old mice, via inhibiting AMPA receptor internalization and reducing the transcription of learning and memory genes in response to a cognitive stimulus (Martin et al., 2014); Palomer et al., 2016). Moreover, in models of T2D, the reduction of neuronal cholesterol plays a decisive role in the loss of cognitive capacity in this situation (Suzuki, Ferris, Chee, Maratos‐Flier, &amp; Kahn, 2013). 2 RESULTS Numerous studies have demonstrated the existence of a deficit in insulin function in aged brains. However, it is not known how these defects affect insulin‐dependent synaptic functions. We observed that insulin‐induced long‐term depression (insulin‐LTD) was impaired in old mice (20–24 months old) compared to adult mice (7–12 months old; Figure 1a). To gain insight into how this insulin deficit occurs, we performed an immunoprecipitation‐based analysis of receptor activity in the hippocampus of adult and old mice in basal conditions. This experiment revealed that both insulin receptor (IR) and insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF‐1R) are constitutively expressed at a higher level in old mice compared to young ones (Figure 1b,c). Among other possible explanations, the deficit in insulin‐LTD (Figure 1a) in conditions of high receptor activity (Figure 1b,c) may be due to the high PI3K activity. This possibility finds support in the fact that activation of IR/IGF‐1R would have produced activation of PI3K, which would phosphorylate PIP2 to PIP3, in turn activating Akt to phosphorylate GSK3β on Serine residue 9 (an inhibitory effect), resulting in the inhibition of hippocampal LTD (Peineau et al., 2007). Consistent with this view, we observed higher levels of active Akt in the hippocampus of old mice compared to adult mice (Figure 1d), and also higher levels of Serine 9‐phosphorylated GSK3β (Figure 1e). Moreover, insulin was able to evoke LTD in hippocampal slices from old mice that were pre‐incubated with PI3K/Akt inhibitors, but not in vehicle‐treated control slices (Figure 1f,g). Insulin signaling is impaired in old mice due to PI3K/Akt hyperactivation.

The asterisks p values (*p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ns = not significant) Reduced insulin function in a cellular background of high levels of active receptor and post‐receptor (PI3K/Akt) phosphorylation speaks in favor of the hippocampus of old mice being in a state of insulin desensitization (Zick, 2001). In agreement, hippocampal activity levels of the Akt downstream targets mTOR, p70S6K, and the resulting negative feedback on PI3K‐adaptor protein IRS‐1 (inhibitory phosphorylation at Serine residues 632 and 307 and 1101; Zick, 2001) are higher in the hippocampus of old vs. adult mice (Supporting Information Figures S1A‐C and S7A,B). In addition, IRS‐2, another IRS family protein that has been previously related to disrupted plasticity in the hippocampus (Costello et al., 2012), shows a trend to be reduced in old mice compared to adult mice (Supporting Information Figure S7C). Finally, another result that supports the existence of a desensitized route during old age is the reduced activation of the insulin receptor in response to peripheral insulin stimulation (Supporting Information Figure S1D) (Fernandez &amp; Torres‐Alemán, 2012). In summary, these results reveal that one reason for the decrease in insulin function in the aged brain is an increase in PI3K/Akt activity, in part due to the chronic activity of tyrosine kinase receptors, such as those for insulin and IGF‐1 (also shown below). Numerous studies have described changes in brain cholesterol and their correlation with cognitive deficits during aging, and in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and T2D (Kadish et al., 2009; Suzuki, Ferris, Chee, Maratos‐Flier, &amp; Kahn, 2013; Suzuki et al., 2010). In previous works, we showed that in the mouse there is also a correlation between cognitive deficit and reduction of membrane cholesterol in the hippocampus (Martín et al., 2014; Palomer et al., 2016; Trovò, Van Veldhoven, Martín, &amp; Dotti, 2011). These observations moved us to test whether hippocampal membrane cholesterol reduction could be involved in the insulin‐desensitized state. To test this possibility, we reduced cholesterol levels in cultured hippocampal neurons by cholesterol oxidase (Choox) treatment. Choox was used at a concentration leading to a mild (~20%) reduction of plasma membrane cholesterol, without affecting cell viability (our previous works: Brachet et al., 2015; Palomer et al., 2016). Choox‐mediated cholesterol reduction led to an increase in phosphorylated IR and IGF‐1R (Supporting Information Figure S2A). Furthermore, cholesterol reduction also resulted in higher phosphorylation levels of Akt (Supporting Information Figure S2B), mTOR (Supporting Information Figure S7D), p70S6K (Supporting Information Figure S2C), and IRS‐1 at Serine 632, 307, and 1,101 (Supporting Information Figures S2D,E, and S7E). Cholesterol reduction was also sufficient to lead to a reduction of IRS‐2 levels (Supporting Information Figure S7F). To assess whether downstream receptor activation by cholesterol reduction was due to activation of IRs, Choox‐treated neurons were incubated with OSI‐906, a competitive inhibitor of IR and IGF‐1R phosphorylation (Mulvihill et al., 2009). OSI‐906 treatment significantly reduced the cholesterol loss‐mediated activation of Akt and IRS‐1 at Serine 632 (Supporting Information Figure S3A,B), but did not completely abrogate it because reduced cholesterol also increases the activity of other tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) (Martin et al., 2008). Nonetheless, the loss of neuronal cholesterol in our model appears to be sufficiently powerful to induce desensitization of the insulin pathway. Next, we performed the converse experiments, adding cholesterol to old neurons. It has been previously shown that the high affinity of methyl‐beta‐cyclodextrin (MβCD) for cholesterol can be used to generate inclusion complexes (MβCD‐Ch) that increase membrane cholesterol levels (Zidovetzki &amp; Levitan, 2007). Thus, hippocampal slices from old mice were incubated with MβCD‐Ch, following protocols used in a previous study in which we evaluated the role of membrane cholesterol in the internalization of glutamate receptors (Martin et al., 2014). The treatment restored cholesterol content to levels similar to those of adult mice (Figure 2a, see also ref. Palomer et al., 2016, and Supporting Information Figure S4A). Consistent with a causal relationship, cholesterol increase in the old slices reduced PI3K/Akt (Figure 2b), p70S6K Threonine residue 389 (Figure 2c), and GSK3β Serine 9 phosphorylation (Figure 2d), and rescued insulin‐LTD (Figure 2e). Furthermore, marks of insulin‐desensitized state on IRS‐1 (Serine 632 and Serine 307) were decreased in the extracts of the cholesterol‐treated slices (Figure 2f,g). Ex vivo cholesterol replenishment in hippocampal slices of old mice restores insulin signaling. (a) Addition of cyclodextrin‐cholesterol (referred as MβCD‐Ch or Cholesterol) solution to old mice hippocampal slices induces a 20% increase in membrane cholesterol. (b, c) Cholesterol addition (as in a) reduces hyperactivated Akt and its downstream target p70S6K. (b) Detection of Akt Phospho‐Serine 473; (c) detection of p70S6K Phospho‐Threonine 389.

The asterisks indicate the p values (*p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01) In order to give in vivo relevance to the above results, we interfered with age‐associated cholesterol loss by inhibiting Cyp46A1, the main catabolic enzyme for cholesterol in the brain (Russell, Halford, Ramirez, Shah, &amp; Kotti, 2009). To that end, the effects of Voriconazole, a specific Cyp46A1 inhibitor capable of crossing the blood–brain barrier, were determined (Shafaati et al., 2010). The oral administration of Voriconazole for 40 days to 20‐month‐old mice significantly reduced age‐associated cholesterol loss compared to untreated old mice (Supporting Information Figure S4A,B), confirming our previous results (Palomer et al., 2016). Biochemically, hippocampal fractions from the treated mice showed significantly reduced levels of PI3K/Akt and the downstream effector p70S6K compared to untreated old mice (Figure 3a,b). Voriconazole treatment also resulted in a reduction of insulin resistance marks on IRS‐1 (Figure 3c,d) and the LTD‐inhibitory GSK3β Serine 9 phosphorylation (Figure 3e). At the electrophysiological level, application of Voriconazole to hippocampal slices of old mice restored insulin‐LTD (Figure 3f). All in all, these results are consistent with the possibility that the decrease in brain cholesterol that occurs with age plays an important role in the impaired brain insulin function of the old. As cells of other organs and tissues undergo changes in lipid composition during aging, and even more so in the case of T2D (Bakan et al., 2006; Pilon, 2016), insulin resistance of peripheral organs might be caused, at least in part, by similar mechanism as those in the hippocampus of old mice. In vivo pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol loss in old mice restores hippocampal insulin sensitivity and insulin‐LTD.

The asterisks indicate the p values (*p &lt; 0.05) One possible explanation for how a reduced cholesterol environment could lead to steady receptor activity is by a tighter packaging of the receptor in liquid‐ordered membrane microdomains (i.e., rafts). Consistent with this possibility, we observed a significant increase of IR in the detergent‐insoluble fraction of hippocampal membranes from old mice compared to adult mice (Supporting Information Figure S5A). Furthermore, in a preliminary experiment we observed reduced levels of activity of Akt in the raft fraction of old mice that had been treated during 40 days with the Cyp46A1 inhibitor Voriconazole (Supporting Information Figure S5B), and therefore with levels of cholesterol similar to younger mice (see Supporting Information Figure S4A,B). Together, these last series of results suggest that aging increases IR clustering and activity in the raft domain of hippocampal cells. The obvious question that follows is: how is it possible that there is more receptor activity in the raft fraction in a membrane with reduced cholesterol? In principle, the age‐dependent loss of cholesterol, a membrane rigidity molecule, is inconsistent with the possibility of increased IR partitioning in ordered domains such as rafts. However, this could be explained from the increase in plasma membrane sphingomyelin (SM), also a determinant of plasma membrane rigidity (Colin et al., 2016), whose levels increase with age and as a consequence of cholesterol reduction (Colin et al., 2016; Trovò, Van Veldhoven, Martín, &amp; Dotti, 2011). In support of this possibility, previous works demonstrated an increase in TrkB receptor clustering in rafts in the plasma membrane of old neurons in a cholesterol‐reduced (Martin et al., 2008) and SM‐increased (Trovò, Van Veldhoven, Martín, &amp; Dotti, 2011) manner. Moreover, also AMPA receptors are trapped in the membrane raft domain of old neurons due to reduced cholesterol (Martin et al., 2014). Thus, it appears that aging disturbs the plasma membrane so that new lipid rafts appear. This phenomenon can also be seen in cultured neurons of different ages (14 and 28 days) stained with di‐4‐ANEPPDHQ, a ratiometric dye that allows quantification of liquid order (Supporting Information Figure S5C; Amaro, Reina, Hof, Eggeling, &amp; Sezgin, 2017; Owen, Rentero, Magenau, Abu‐Siniyeh, &amp; Gaus, 2012). Although this result is from an ""aging‐in‐the‐dish"" experiment, it is noteworthy that in vitro ""aged"" hippocampal neurons present numerous changes that are typical of old hippocampal neurons in vivo, including but not limited to the gradual accumulation of senescence markers and a steady, significant reduction of cholesterol due to the activation of the Cyp46A1 enzyme (Martin et al., 2008; Sodero et al., 2011). The above results led us to speculate that the cholesterol loss observed in old neurons could facilitate insulin/IGF‐1 activation by physically packaging the receptor subunit in the ordered domains, enabling thereby ligand‐independent autophosphorylation. In order to test this possibility, we transfected cells with full‐length IGF‐1R constructs bearing fluorescent donor or acceptor tags in the intracellular domain (as in Kavran et al., 2014), followed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. As shown in the previous sections, both IR and IGF‐1R present the same age‐associated activity increase in a cholesterol‐dependent manner, suggesting that the FRET results based on IGF‐1R should be comparable to what occurs with IR and perhaps any other RTK. Previous work has shown that both receptors require insulin or IGF‐1 binding to their extracellular domain in order to become active, inducing a conformational change in the transmembrane domain leading to physical approach and autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails (Kavran et al., 2014; Lemmon &amp; Schlessinger, 2010). Previously established acceptor photobleaching FRET protocols allowed us to assess cytoplasmic tail proximity in response to different stimuli. Specifically, the donor intensity upon acceptor photobleaching and transfer of energy between fluorescent molecules is a measure of their proximity (see Section 4). To determine whether cholesterol loss could be considered a general mechanism of ligand‐independent receptor activation, we performed FRET experiments in two cell types, Hek‐293T and hippocampal neurons. In Hek‐293T cells, addition of the receptor–ligand (IGF‐1) caused the expected increase in FRET efficiency (Supporting Information Figure S6A,B). In order to test whether cholesterol loss similarly increased FRET, which would support induction by a similar conformational change, IGF‐1R‐transfected cells were treated with Choox as in the previous experiments (see Supporting Information Figure S2). Cholesterol reduction was sufficient per se to significantly increase the receptor's FRET efficiency (Supporting Information Figure S6C), though at a lower magnitude than addition of the natural ligand (see quantification in Supporting Information Figure S6D). This was expected, consistent with the slow development of insulin resistance parallel to the slow progression of brain cholesterol changes. Next, we repeated the experiment in cultured hippocampal neurons, transfected with the same IGF‐1R carrying EYFP and mCherry tags. Addition of IGF‐1 led to high FRET efficiency relative to untreated neurons (Figure 4a,b), with similar results in neurons treated with Choox in the absence of exogenous ligand (Figure 4c). However, as observed in Hek‐293T cells, the magnitude of the FRET increase was lower in conditions of low cholesterol compared to the ligand (Figure 4d). Cholesterol loss favors in neurons the conformational changes required for insulin growth factor 1 receptor's activation. (a, b, c) FRET experiment. Laser microscopy images of cultured neurons co‐transfected with IGF‐1R‐EYFP (donor fluorophore) and IGF‐1R‐mCherry (acceptor fluorophore), with the fluorophores replacing the cytosolic tails of the entire receptor sequence. Neurons maintained in Neurobasal+B27 (without serum) remained un‐stimulated (a), were stimulated with 4 μM IGF‐1 (b), or were treated with 10 IU/ml Choox before fixation (c). Acceptor signal was bleached, intensity of donor signal was measured, and FRET efficiencies were calculated (see Materials and Methods). Scale bars represent 10 μm. (d) Cholesterol loss enables in neurons a plasma membrane environment sufficient to induce the conformational change on IGF‐1R required for receptor activation, thus increasing FRET efficiency.

One‐way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni's test for (a, b, c). The asterisks indicate the p values (*p &lt; 0.05; ***p &lt; 0.001). (e) Summary of how age produces insulin resistance in the mouse hippocampus: cholesterol loss, due in part to Cyp46a1 activation (and also to SCAP reduction, and perhaps others), favors an increase in plasma membrane ordered domains where the IR/IGF‐1R preferentially cluster (membrane yellow segments). This clustering facilitates the conformational changes required for the receptor's autophosphorylation in a ligand‐independent manner (phosphor motifs in IR/IGF‐1R). If this type of receptor change occurs over a prolonged period of time and incrementally (as it is the case with the loss of cholesterol with age), the post‐receptor pathway will also be activated chronically, leading to desensitization (phospho‐motifs in IRS‐1) and loss of insulin synaptic plasticity function (Akt inhibition on GSK3β and AMPAR inhibited internalization) 3 DISCUSSION Previous studies, in humans and in mice, point in the direction that some of the cognitive deficits of the old are due, among other causes, to the decreased levels or activity of insulin and IGF‐1 receptors and to a reduction in the signaling pathway by PI3K/Akt (Deak &amp; Sonntag, 2012; Zaia &amp; Piantanelli, 2000). This is quite different from the increased tonic receptor activity in the hippocampus of old mice, and increased PI3K/Akt pathway that we show here. The differences could be due to (perhaps too simplistic) the type of cellular or animal model, gender, or age utilized in the different works. On the other hand, given that in both studies the final result is loss of insulin signaling, it is not unrealistic to hypothesize that the different results simply reflect two stages of the same process: that is, increased basal receptor/PI3K‐Akt activity (as shown here) followed by reduction in the levels and sensitivity of Insulin/IGF‐1 receptors (as observed in previous works). More work is needed to determine whether this hypothesis is correct. In addition to demonstrating that the insulin and IGF‐1 receptors are tonically active in the old, we also present evidence that this might be the consequence of the age‐associated alteration in the neuronal plasma membrane fluidity due to the reduction in plasma membrane cholesterol content. Although numerous studies have described changes in brain cholesterol and their correlation with cognitive deficits during aging, and in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and T2D (Kadish et al., 2009; Martín et al., 2014; Palomer et al., 2016; Suzuki, Ferris, Chee, Maratos‐Flier, &amp; Kahn, 2013; Suzuki et al., 2010), an association between changes in brain cholesterol and brain insulin resistance has not been established before. In this work, we present two series of results that support such a causal link: (a) The loss of insulin function in old mice can be rescued by either inhibition of cholesterol loss in vivo or by the addition of cholesterol to hippocampal slices from old mice, and (b) the removal of cholesterol in young neurons is sufficient to induce insulin resistance. At a finer mechanistic level, our data are consistent with the notion that a reduction in the cholesterol content in the plasma membrane produces molecular rearrangements that favor receptors' spontaneous (ligand‐independent) activity, for example, by increasing the proximity of the receptor transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, inducing their autophosphorylation and activation (Figure 4e) in a manner similar to the addition of its natural ligand (Kavran et al., 2014; Lemmon &amp; Schlessinger, 2010). This is supported, indirectly, by the higher number of active IR in the detergent‐insoluble domain of hippocampal membranes from old mice (see Supporting Information Figure S5A). The above conclusion also finds direct support from the increased fluorescence recovery of the donor–receptor after photobleaching of the acceptor in cells treated with Choox (see Figure 4). Despite the severe limitations of FRET experiments performed in transfected cells exposed to an acute cholesterol reduction strategy, they provide a possible explanation for how a lack of cholesterol could lead to chronic activation of IR/IGF‐1R receptors and pathway desensitization. This does not exclude that also other mechanisms such as hyperinsulinemia may contribute to such chronic receptor activity. In addition to increased receptor and post‐receptor (PI3K/Akt) activity, the loss of cholesterol also produces an increase in activity of mTORC1. This last result contradicts recent studies that show that cholesterol increases mTORC1 activity (Castellano et al., 2017). As before, there are substantial differences in the experimental models that can easily explain the divergent results (i.e., cell lines vs. hippocampal neurons, in vitro and in vivo, lysosomal mTORC1 vs. cytosolic mTORC1). Irrespective, our demonstration of the existence of a strong PI3K/Akt activity in the old hippocampus and in conditions of cholesterol loss (of note: this was also reported in Martín et al., 2014 and in Trovò et al., 2013) makes us feel confident that aging increases mTORC1 activity in a cholesterol loss/Akt‐dependent manner and that this can be responsible in part for the negative phosphorylation of IRS‐1 and desensitization of the insulin signaling pathway. In further agreement, the increase in mTORC1 activity in the old hippocampus and in cultured hippocampal neurons with reduced cholesterol could explain the age and cholesterol loss‐dependent increase in P‐p70S6K and in IRS‐1‐negative phosphorylation. There may seem to be a contradiction between desensitization of the insulin pathway and high basal activity levels of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as the activity of the latter depends on the former. However, it is worth remembering that PI3K/Akt activity is a common effector of numerous intracellular pathways, many of which are potentiated during aging, including interleukin production and activation of other RTKs (Martin et al., 2008; Xiao, Peng, Gan, Arafat, &amp; Yin, 2016). This ""normal"" increase of PI3K/Akt in the cytoplasm of old neurons would explain why suppression of PI3K activity rescues LTD upon addition of insulin. Given the fact that the PI3K/Akt cascade is one of the important cell survival pathways (Kim et al., 2002; Miyawaki et al., 2009), neuronal survival mechanisms seem to be strengthened during aging and this redefinition of metabolic/organismic priorities occurs to the detriment of other cellular functions, such as LTD. On the other hand, the high PI3K/Akt activity observed in the old hippocampus may be the reason why age does not largely affect the magnitude of LTP (reviewed in Kumar, 2011), a process highly dependent on PI3K/Akt. Only future work can bring more light to how the increased activity of the PI3K‐Akt pathway in the old brain participates in the balance between LTP and LTD in the hippocampus and between plasticity and survival. Thus, we believe that besides helping to understand how insulin function becomes reduced in the brain with age, our work also opens ways to investigate essential events of aging, such as the relationship between survival and plasticity. 4 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 4.1 Animal handling Male adult (7–12 months old) and old (20–24 months old) C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. All the animals were kept in the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO) animal facility. All experiments were performed in accordance with European Union guidelines (2010/63/UE) regarding the use of laboratory animals. 4.2 Animal treatment Voriconazole (from Hangzhou Dayangchem Co., China CAS No: 137234‐62‐9) was solubilized using (2‐hydroxypropyl)‐β‐cyclodextrin (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, MO): 15 g of (2‐hydroxypropyl)‐β‐cyclodextrin was dissolved in 100 ml of saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and heated to 80°C in a water bath with stirring. Then, 1.5 g of Voriconazole was added to the cyclodextrin solution with stirring at 80°C until complete dissolution. This stock solution (15 mg Voriconazole/ml cyclodextrin/saline) was conserved at 4°C protected from light. On the first day of experimentation, an aliquot of this solution was diluted in drinking water to a final concentration of 0.68 mg/ml Voriconazole. Considering that a mouse drinks 3 ml water per day, the dose corresponds to 2.04 mg/day. The average weight of a mouse is 34 g, resulting therefore in a dose 60 mg/kg body weight. Water with this concentration of Voriconazole was used as the hydration source in 20‐month‐old mice during 45 days. Vehicle 20‐month‐old mice received the same amount of (2‐hydroxypropyl)‐β‐cyclodextrin than Voriconazole mice during 45 days. Bottles containing the Voriconazole or vehicle water were changed weekly. 4.3 Hippocampal slices Hippocampal slices were obtained from C57BL/6J mice. Hippocampi were extracted and placed in dissection solution (10 mM d‐glucose, 4 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 233.7 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 1:1,000 phenol red), oxygen saturated with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2), and sliced using an automatic tissue chopper (McIlwain Tissue Chopper, Standard Table, 220 V; Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) to obtain 400 µm hippocampal slices. Then, slices were kept in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 11 mM glucose, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, osmolarity adjusted to 290 Osm), oxygen saturated with carbogen for 1 hr. Experiments were performed in ACSF, oxygen saturated with carbogen. 4.4 Cell cultures Hek‐293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (complete DMEM). Primary hippocampal neurons were extracted from Wistar rat embryos at embryonic day 18 (E18), seeded in culture conditions as previously described (Kaech &amp; Banker, 2006), and kept in culture for 15 days in vitro (DIV). All cells were incubated at 37ºC, humidity conditions, and 5% CO2. 4.5 Cell treatments The following compounds were added to cell medium of hippocampal neurons and Hek‐293T: OSI‐906 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX ref.: S1091; 1 µM); Cholesterol oxidase (Choox; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA ref.: 228250; 10 IU/ml); human peptide purified IGF‐1 (Stem Cell Technologies, Canada #78022; 4 µM). For electrophysiology experiments we used: Insulin (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, MO ref.: I0516; 0.5 µM); Quercetin (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, MO ref.: Q4951; 20 µM); Wortmannin (Tocris, UK ref.: 1232; 0.5 µM); and Voriconazole (Hangzhou Dayangchem Co., China; 10 nM). Experiments for cholesterol addition conducted in hippocampal slices were performed at 25ºC. Methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin‐cholesterol (MβCD‐Ch) solution was prepared freshly at use concentration in ACSF, containing 30 µM Cholesterol Water‐soluble (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, MO ref.: C4951) and 5 µM Cholesterol (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, MO ref.: C3045). 4.6 Cholesterol quantification Hippocampal extracts were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 25 mM MES, 2 mM EDTA, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma‐Aldrich), and Protease Inhibitor Complete (Roche, Switzerland). The protein amount was quantified by Pierce® BCA Assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the cholesterol content measured per microgram of protein using the Amplex® Red Cholesterol Assay kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 4.7 Antibodies The following antibodies were used for Western blot (WB) and immunoprecipitation (IP): anti‐α‐Tubulin (WB 1:10,000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK ref.: ab7291), anti‐β‐Actin (WB 1:20,000; Sigma‐Aldrich ref.: A5441), anti‐GAPDH (WB 1:20,000; Abcam, ref.: ab8245), anti‐Akt (WB 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Danver, MA ref.: #9272), anti–Phospho‐Akt Serine 473 (WB 1:1,000, Cell Signaling ref.: #4060), anti‐GSK3 α/β (WB 1:1,000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA ref.: 44–610), anti‐Phospho GSK3 α/β Serine 21/9 (WB 1:1,000; Cell Signaling ref.: #9331), anti‐IGF‐1 Receptor β (WB 1:1,000, IP 1:100; Cell Signaling ref.: #9750), anti‐Phospho IGF‐1 receptor β Tyr1135/116 (WB 1:1,000; Cell Signaling ref.: #3024), anti‐Insulin receptor β (IP 1:100, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX ref.: sc‐57342), anti‐Insulin receptor β (WB 1:750, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX ref.: sc‐711), anti‐Phospho insulin receptor β Tyr1150/1151 (WB 1:750; Millipore, Burlington, MA ref.: 04‐299), anti‐IRS‐1 (WB 1:1,000; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ ref.: 611394), anti‐Phospho IRS‐1 Serine 307 (WB 1:750; Abcam ref.: ab4865), anti‐Phospho IRS‐1 Serine 632 (WB 1:200; Cell Signaling ref.: #2388), anti‐Phospho IRS‐1 Serine 1101 (WB 1:1,000; Cell Signaling ref.: #2385), anti‐mTOR (WB 1:1,000; Cell Signaling ref.: #4517), anti‐Phospho mTOR Serine 2448 (WB 1:2,500; Cell Signaling ref.: #5536), anti‐p70S6K (WB 1:1,000; BD Biosciences ref.: 611260), anti‐Phospho p70S6K Threonine 389 (WB 1:750; Cell Signaling ref.: #9206), anti‐IRS‐2 (WB 1:500, Upstate 06‐506), anti‐Vinculin (WB 1:1,000; Millipore ref.: AB6039). 4.8 Insulin receptor sensitivity experiment Insulin receptor sensitivity was determined in mouse hippocampus by measuring the capability of the receptor to become active upon ligand supply. Adult and old male mice were intraperitoneally injected with 27 IU/kg body weight of human purified insulin (Actrapid®, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) diluted in saline solution (0.9% NaCl). Injected mice were kept 1 hr at regular conditions and then sacrificed. Hippocampi were extracted and processed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris‐HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP‐40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma‐Aldrich), and Protease Inhibitor Complete (Roche, Switzerland). The protein amount was quantified by Pierce® BCA Assay kit. Samples were immunoprecipitated using an antibody against insulin receptor, and the level of receptor phosphorylation was determined by Western blot. 4.9 Insoluble vs. soluble membrane fraction isolation: Extracts from adult and old mice hippocampi were incubated for 40 min at 4°C under rotation in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA [pH 7.4]) containing 1% Triton X‐100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail. The suspension was centrifuged at 184000 g rpm for 1 hr at 4°C. After centrifugation, the detergent‐insoluble membranes (raft) were collected from the pellet, whereas detergent soluble material (nonraft) was retrieved from the supernatant. 4.10 Raft fraction isolation Mice hippocampal extracts were incubated at 4ºC for 45 min in 1% Triton X‐100, 10 mM MES (2‐[N‐morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 7.00), 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma‐Aldrich), and Protease Inhibitor Complete (Roche). Samples were brought to 60% sucrose. A discontinuous gradient was overlaid with 35% and 5% sucrose. After centrifugation at 100,000 g for 18 hr at 4ºC, 12 fractions were collected. 4.11 Fluorescence resonance energy transfer Insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF‐1R) activity was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in hippocampal neurons in culture or Hek‐293T transfected with IGF‐1R extracellular and transmembrane regions fused to EYFP (FRET donor) or mCherry (FRET acceptor). Plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Patrick. O. Byrne and Dr. Daniel J. Leahy from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA. Neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher ref.: #11668027). Hek‐293T cells were transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI) reagent (Polysciences, Warrington, PA ref.: #23966‐2). Forty‐eight hours later, cells were treated. Neurons were maintained in Neurobasal+B27 medium without serum for treatments. Hek‐293T cells required 5‐hr starvation in DMEM without FBS and glutamine previous to treatment. Different treatments were applied to determine the FRET efficiency: control situation (cells incubated only with starving medium), positive control situation (cells incubated with IGF‐1 peptide 4 µM), and study situation (cells incubated with Choox 10 IU/ml). After treatments, cells were fixed with 1% PFA for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, PFA was removed and cells were washed four times in 1× PBS and mounted onto slides using Mowiol–Dabco (Mowiol, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) without antifading. A confocal LSM710 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) coupled to an inverted AxioObserver Z1 microscope (Zeiss) was used for conducting acceptor photobleaching FRET experiments. Images were acquired using the following wavelengths: λexc = 488 nm, λem = 503–532 nm for EYFP; λexc = 561 nm, λem = 600–699 nm for mCherry. Three prebleaching and four postbleaching images were taken in both channels. Photobleaching was performed in delimited regions of interest (ROI) of the cells, in particular in the plasma membrane of the cells where the IGF‐1R is mainly located under physiological conditions. Images were taken using a 63× oil objective, and the ROIs used were squares of regular size. Acceptor signal was bleached up to a 10% of its initial magnitude applying the highest laser intensity during thirty iterations to the selected ROI. Zeiss imaging software was used to calculate FRET efficiency using the following equation: where Donorpre corresponds EYFP signal before bleaching, and Donorpost corresponds to final EYFP signal after bleaching. All images were background‐subtracted. 4.12 Electrophysiology (insulin‐LTD) Adult and old mice were tested for synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region in vitro. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and the hippocampus was rapidly dissected out into ice‐cold (4ºC) ACSF saturated with carbogen. ACSF for electrophysiology experiments consisted of: 124 mM NaCl, 4.9 mM KCl, 25.6 mM NaHCO3, 1.20 mM KH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4. Transverse slices (400 µm thick) were prepared from the dorsal area of the right hippocampus with a tissue chopper and placed into a submerged‐type chamber, where they were kept at 32ºC and continuously perfused with ACSF at a flow rate of 2.2 ml/min. After 90‐min incubation, one slice was arbitrarily selected and a tungsten electrode was placed in CA1 stratum radiatum. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded by placing a glass electrode (filled with ACSF, 3–7 MΩ) in the stratum radiatum opposite the stimulating electrode. The time course of the field EPSP was measured as the descending slope function for all sets of experiments. After input/output curves had been established, the stimulation strength was adjusted to elicit a fEPSP slope of 35% of the maximum and kept constant throughout the experiment. During baseline recording, 3 single stimuli (0.1 ms pulse width; 10‐s interval) were measured every 5 min and averaged for the 60‐min fEPSP values. Unless otherwise stated, insulin‐mediated LTD was achieved by application of 0.5 µM insulin dissolved in ACSF for 30 min commencing at time zero (Huang et al., 2004). Drug or test substances were applied from 30 min prior to until 30 min after the start of insulin application. Evoked responses were initially monitored at 1, 4, 7, and 10 min and then continually every 5 min as above. 4.13 Plasma membrane order experiment Rat hippocampal neurons were cultured 14 and 28 days in vitro (DIV) and fixed in 4% PFA. For lipid phase imaging, cells were stained with di‐4‐ANEPPDHQ (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For imaging, we used a Nikon A1R confocal microscope attached to Ti eclipse outfitted with a Plan Apo VC 60× lens, oil immersion lens, with a NA of 1.4. For imaging, we used the spectral detector of the system set to 530–590 nm and 590–650 nm to image the spectral shift of the dye from lipid ordered to disordered phase. The resulting images were analyzed according to Owen Rentero Magenau Abu‐Siniyeh and Gaus (2012). To compare the two groups, the average value of 108 (60 for 14 DIV [12/coverslip, 5 experiments] and 48 for 28 DIV [12/coverslip, 4 experiments]) fields of view was reported. 4.14 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). All values are presented as mean ± SEM. Data normality and variances were tested by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Mann–Whitney U test, Kruskal–Wallis test, or Friedman test, with Dunn's adjustment for multiple comparisons, was used for nonparametric data. Student's t test or ANOVA with Bonferroni's adjustment for multiple comparisons was used for parametric data.

Insulin Therapy for Schizophrenia,"THE INSULIN TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA From An Introduction to Physical Methods of Treatment in Psychiatry (First Edition) by William Sargant and Eliot Slater (1944, Edinburgh, E &amp; S Livingstone). Feedback about this article? Not long after insulin came to be generally used in medicine it was found that in small doses it could be used to improve appetite in cases of anorexia, and that there followed a general improvement in the physical and mental state. The clue was not followed up until Sakel came to use insulin hypoglycaemia to counter the symptoms of withdrawal in the treatment of morphine addiction. He found that he got the best results when a sufficient dosage of insulin was given to produce clinical hypoglycemia, and that this phenomenon, hitherto considered dangerous, was readily controlled by the administration of sugar, when the patients were watched throughout. He was led to try its use in the I treatment of schizophrenia, and the Vienna Clinic, which had seen the first introduction of the malarial treatment of general paralysis, provided him with the patients to experiment on. The idea seemed bizarre, but it was found to work. Once tried its results were, in individual patients, so surprisingly favourable that its use spread widely and quickly. In the international congress of 1938 reports were presented of its trial in most of the civilised countries of the world; nearly all of them were favourable. The disorganisation of the war years has to a great extent interrupted its progress in England but it has gone ahead much faster in America. Manfred Sakel STATISTICAL RESULTS Reliable statistics are mostly in favour of the value of the treatment. In a series of over 400 patients treated in Swiss hospitals before 1937, when the technique was still new, 59 per cent. of persons treated within the first six months after onset reached either a complete or social remission. In the New York State hospitals of over a thousand schizo- phrenics treated with insulin 11.1 per cent. recovered, 26.5 per cent. made great improvement, and 26 per cent. some improvement; the corresponding figures in over a thousand control patients were 3.5 per cent., 11.2 per cent. and 7.4 per cent. A comparable number of patients treated with cardiazol convulsion therapy did not do even as well as the control patients. Furthermore, the treatment greatly shortens the duration of the illness. Earl Bond reports that in the Penn- sylvania Hospital 95 per cent, of the patients who were treated and recovered left the hospital within a month of termination of treatment; with few exceptions the un- treated patients who made spontaneous remissions required one to three years for a similar improvement. Thirty-eight per cent. of his treated patients remitted, where there had been previously only 10 per cent, remission and 10 per cent improvements occurring spontaneously. The results are much more favourable when treatment is given early. The New York State hospital figures show that only 27 per cent. of the patients treated in the first six months of the illness failed to improve, whereas this figure rose to 66 per cent. for those whose illness had lasted five years Taking a dividing line of 18 months, Earl Bond finds 67 per cent, recovery and great improvement with treatment given before that time after onset, 30 per cent. after. The prog nostically favourable patients selected for admission to the Maudsley Hospital showed 34.5 per cent. of social recoveries when followed up for three years; 70 per cent, of the patients selected for insulin treatment recovered in the same hospital at a later time. In both these groups the illness had not lasted longer than a year. It is not yet known whether these recoveries will be maintained; but the three to one ratio in frequency of improvement in treated as compared with untreated schizophrenics quoted from the New York State hospitals statistics was still maintained after two years, and 60 per cent. of the insulin treated patients were still living in the community mostly in a recovered or improved condition. Relapses occur both in patients who have recovered spontaneously and with insulin It may be that as the years progress treated and control groups will tend to approximate; but even if this proves to be true one would wish to keep the potential lunatic sane as long as possible, and to give him as long a period as possible of health and happiness. There is also evidence that the relapsed schizophrenic is still susceptible to treatment especially if each relapse is treated immediately it starts. Provided early cases are treated, it is then probably true to say that insulin treatment brings about a remission quicker and in a higher proportion of patients than occurs spon- taneously or with convulsive therapy. There is also a less unanimous impression that the quality of the remission obtained with insulin is better than that of the spontaneous remission; this is likely to be true, if for no other reason than that recovery takes place earlier under treatment and there is less time for the psychological scarring that is the most terrible effect of the disease. There is unanimity that in the earliest months of the illness the results are out of all pro- portion better than later on. In some patients the illness comes on so insidiously that even retrospectively none but the widest limits can be assigned to the time when it started, and these patients it is generally agreed are the most un- favourable therapeutically. This may quite possibly be not because the form of the illness is more malignantordinary clinical judgment suggests the opposite conclusionbut because in all these patients the illness is likely~ to have lasted for months or even years before it is even suspected. Finally, it is clear that there is an art of treatment, in which some will be more adept than others, and that operations cannot be conducted by rule of thumb. Different workers have obtained very different results with the same type of material, both in the frequency of remission and of unpleasant complications. Earl Bond notes that in a group treated in the Pennsylvania Hospital between 1936 and 1938 treatment was given tentatively and was in the hands of several different physicians and all possible risks were avoided; only 46 per cent. of remissions was obtained in cases of less than a years duration. After 1938 a single skilled therapist was employed, and the comparable remission rate rose to 79 per cent. This may be partly because where there is a specific treatment available, patients still in the early stages of the illness are encouraged to seek treatment; but at least part of the im- provement in the recovery rate must be attributed to the greater expertness of the treatment and the giving of really deep comas when necessary. It is only too easy to carry out the treatment in a slipshod or incautious way, or to err on the side of over-easy discouragement. The successful therapist will be gifted with enthusiasm and caution, he will have a sympathetic interest in and a detached appreciation of the personalities of his patients, he will have the general medical training that has accustomed him to the handling of medical emergencies, and the refined clinical judgment of the èx- perienced psychiatrist, and he will have the facilities to give the whole of his energy to the treatment of his patients without administrative after-thought. The abilities of the therapist are not less important than the method of treat- ment adopted. On his skill alone the recovery of any particular patient may ultimately depend. THE SELECTION OF PATIENTS It is rarely indeed that facilities will exist for the treatment by a full course of insulin of all the schizophrenics coming under observation, and it is therefore important not to waste the treatment on patients not very likely to respond while denying it to the favourable case. The first point for considera- tion is the length of duration of the illness, and this does not mean of overt symptoms. The patient who has only recently come to show definite and unmistakable symptoms but has been known to have been gradually becoming queerer for several years is not a favourable case for treatment. The most favourable case would be the patient who had been well up to a few days or weeks of being seen, and he should be selected even if there is some lingering doubt of the true nature of the illness and probabilities only speak in favour of schizophrenia. An atypical onset should not be allowed to develop gradually over the course of months into an unmistakable clinical picture before treatment is begun. This position is likely to arise in atypical manic excitements, in obscure confusional states, and even in depressive states with a suggestion of catatonia, of hallucinations or other suggestive symptoms. In any case it must be remembered that schizophrenic psychoses greatly outnumber all others in persons under the age of thirty. From the much greater success in the early case it follows that once treatment is decided on it should be begun at the earliest possible moment. If there is a waiting list for admission, the early schizophrenic should take precedence of most other patients, firstly for the reason already given, and secondly because in the early stages the clinical picture is very fluid and an attempted suicide, an attack of excitement or violence may remove the patient from the possibility of treatment where it has been arranged to another place where there may be further delays. As even a few weeks makes a difference, this would be a serious matter. The rapidity with which treatment can be inaugurated after the onset of the illness is by far the most important factor therapeutically. Next in importance ranks the quality of the personality before the illness began. A frank, open and socially well-adjusted personality reacts better than one which has always been shy, shut off, awkward and autistic. There are probably a number of reasons for this. The autistic personality may not have always been so, but have become so as the result of an early and unrecognised schizophrenic process, which -has perhaps become chronic, only to show a recent florid exacerbation. Further, restoration cannot at its optimum be to the same level in the defective as in the thoroughly normal personality. This is perhaps the principal factor that militates against the successful treatment of schizophrenia in the intellectually retarded. Rapidity of onset is generally held to be a favourable factor, which would imply that in two schizophrenics in both of whom the illness was of three months' duration, the one in whom it began in florid form would have the advantage over the other in whom it began gradually. This may be because in the latter the true point of onset would be set further back ; but it may also be because the more acute illness is more easily reversible. The bodily physique has been found to be of importance, and the pyknic or athletic habitus is more favourab!e than the asthenic and the dysplastic. This is a very general clinical impression, and has recently been confirmed by Freudenberg. Freudenberg has also found that an abundance of "" process symptoms,"" such as hallucinations, thought disorder, primary delusions, passivity feelings, etc., are unfavourable. A history of a previous attack with a full remission, is on the other hand, a favourable sign. It is also our impression that an atypical quality in the symptomatology is a sign of good omen. These favourable and unfavourable factors seem to act cumulatively, and very satisfactory results can be expected from the patient who shows all of the first and none of the second, whereas if the opposite is true treatment is hardly worth while. In patients who fall between these two groups the results obtained will also be intermediate; there will not be the same frequency of complete success as in the most favourable group, but considerable improvement, sufficient for social rehabilitation, will often be obtained even where a complete remission appears unattainable. It will be seen that the factors that favour a satisfactory response to insulin are also those clinically associated with a higher expectation of spontaneous remission; but this would be an inadequate argument in favour of a laissez-faire attitude. The tragedies of neglected insulin treatment in England are to-day a commonplace to the psychiatrist of experience; we have as yet seen no tragedies from premature treatment skilfully applied. THE RISKS OF TREATMENT The risks of treatment are in general less than the risks of waiting for spontaneous remission to occur. Massed figures gathered in the United States give a mortality of 90 deaths in 12,000 patients treated, of which about half were due to hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, which is thus seen to be the most serious risk of treatment; it is, on the other hand, a:n avoidable risk and is the rarer the more skilled the operator. In this series there were also twelve deaths from heart failure, nine from aspiration pneumonia, seven from pneumonia occurring otherwise, some of which were probably also avoid- able. The New York State hospital figures show that there was a higher mortality in the untreated than in the treated patients. It may be that patients with better physique were selected for treatment, and if so that could partly explain the result. It is also true that the patient's bodily health rapidly deteriorates. under an acute schizophrenic psychosis, thereby laying him open to a greater risk of tuberculosis and intercurrent disease .han where the process is cut short by treatment. Twelve patients died of pulmonary tuberculosis in the control group, only one in the insulin treated group. A mortality of less than one per cent. cannot be considered a reasonable bar to treatment in the average patient; and the risk of death or serious damage to bodily health can be neglected in all but the physically ill. Any advanced degree of cardiac disease is usually considered a contraindication to treatment, as are also Graves disease, diabetes, liver and kidney diseases causing marked impairment of function. Treatment can be dangerous, and is rarely successful, above the age of forty-five. Careful investigations have shown that in patients with a prolonged series of deep comas there is sometimes a mild degree of intellectual impairment the effect is much smaller than that also seen in patients of all kinds treated by con- vulsion therapy, which is far from great or constant. The degree of impairment has been of practical importance in only a handful of patients reported in the literature, and is in any case not comparable with the disability caused by the disease itself. Mental impairment is of much greater im- portance after long irreversible coma, and a severe Korsakow picture can result from this. This improves somewhat as a rule, but usually leaves a greater or lesser degree of permanent impairment. Its occurrence is the principal reason why the deliberate production of irreversible comas, which often have an immediate curative effect on the schizophrenic process, has not been extensively tried as a method of treatment, and should remain exclusively in the hands of treatment experts of long experience. A minor but still important reason why treatment as early as possible is so desirable, is that there is a lesser necessity for repeated deep comas, with the attendant risk of irreversible coma. THE TECHNIQUE OF TREATMENT We are indebted to the Journai of Mental Science for permission to include in this chapter the illustration and some of the details of technique from an article by Fraser and Sargent 1940 The beginner would be well advised, before starting this treatment, to go for a week or more if possible to a hospital where it is done on a fair scale. The technique cannot .be learned from books alone, and some practical experience is necessary of the dangers that may be met with. The following technique here described mostly arises from experience gained from 1937 onwards at the Maudsley Hospital in conjunction with Dr. Russell Fraser, and subsequently in an E.M.S. Neurological Unit where early cases could be admitted and treated under the conditions obtaining in a general hospital. Lack of the best facilities should not prevent treatment altogether; and the dangers of treatment under adverse cir- cumstances may have to be balanced against the dangers of delay. It is quite possible to carry out the insulin treatment of schizophrenia in a general ward, with the patient screened off during the coma period. Nevertheless where schizophrenics are going to be treated in any number a special insulin treatment unit is very desirable. Excited patients cannot be easily handled in general wards, and even quietly behaved schizophrenics are likely to become noisy and difficult during hypoglycaemia. A fairly large room should be taken, in which all the patients it is proposed to treat at one time can be kept economically under observation: off this there should be one or two side-rooms available for the more restless and noisy. These rooms will be kept at a warm temperature, as patients perspire profusely and often throw off their bedclothes. To staff the unit a well-trained team of nurses is required, of whom as many as possible should have both a general and a psychiatric training. Experience of medical and surgical emergencies is very valuable in the management of this complicated method of treatment. A sister should be in charge, and on duty during the treatment period every day. Changes in staff from day to day mean that minor alterations in the behaviour of individual patients during sopor and coma may be missed, to the danger of the patients: for behaviour varies widely from patient to patient while remaining very constant to the individual, and a nurse who knows the patient well can detect signs of danger Jhat would not be at all noticeable to anyone else. Every effort should therefore be made to keep the team together, and avoid changes of more than one of the personnel at a time or at less than well-spaced intervals. The sister is of coutse the most important of all; and it will be her responsibility to assemble and maintain the equipment so that none is astray at an emergency. The patients also should be kept together through the greater part of the day. Their food intake at every meal has to be carefully supervised, and they themselves must be kept under supervision to prevent the occurrence of after-shocks in the afternoon or evening. If they go out in the afternoon, it should be in the company of a nurse supplied with glucose to give to any of them who may suddenly develop a recurrence of hypoglycemic symptoms. Apart from the usual ward apparatus such as intravenous syringes (1 to 20 c.c.), intravenous needles kept freshly sharpened and in perfect state, a variety of small basins, swabs, surgical spirit, etc., the following special equipment is required: blood-pressure apparatus, air-way, tongue-clips, mouth gag for use in the event of a fit (a rubber heel covered in mackintosh or a dogs small rubber bone are serviceable), an emergency apparatus for giving 5 per cent. carbon dioxide in oxygen, ampoules of adrenalin, morphine, hyoscine, 10 per cent. calcium chloride, sodium amytal, atropine, coramine, eucortone, nicotinic acid, vit. B.1, and luminal (all suitable for intravenous and intramuscular use). The means of cutting down on a vein should also be at hand. On one or two small portable trays are placed the means of nasal interruption. The nasal tubes selected should be stiff and of fine bore, and should be discarded when they get soft from repeated boiling. On the same trays there will be lubricating oil, litmus paper and an aspiration syringe for sucking out a test sample of the stomach contents through the nasal tube. The container of 600 c.c. of 38 per cent. sugared tea (6.5 oz. sugar to the pint) is also on this tray. The tea should be prepared before treatment starts in the morning and kept till needed in bulk in a large jug containing sufficient for the needs of all patients. This reservoir of sugared tea must be kept warm, for instance in a large thermos jug, and from it the smaller receptacles for individual trays can be filled just before interruption. Another special tray or trolley holds the equipment for an emergency intravenous interruptionone or two syringes each containing 20 c.c. of fresh sterile 83 per cent. glucose solution and a sterilised bowl from which they may be rapidly refilled. Sealed bottles of 38 per cent. glucose should also be at hand, and only opened before the injection starts. There should be ample amounts of 5 per cent. glucose saline ready for emer- gency intravenous use, but it need not be specially heated. Sarganta and Fraser have adapted for use in insulin therapy a composite pressure apparatus which avoids the necssity of having to change syringes in giving large quantities of 33 per cent glucose or glucose salines intravenously, with the risk of losing one's place in the vein every time the change is made. From the illustration it will be seen that it is a simple pressure bottle attached to a syringe with a side-valve. The needle is inserted into the vein, and with the first part of the plunger, blood is sucked into the syringe, thereby showing that the needle is in position. Further withdrawal of the plunger beyond the side-valve allows the 33 per cent glucose solution in the pressure bottle to flow freely through the syringe into the vein. Bottles of 5 per cent saline are kept in stock which also fit the same screwcap of the apparatus. If after the 33 per cent glucose has been given, a change to 5 per cent glucose or saline is required, this is effected simply by unscrewing one bottle and screwing on the other, pressure being re-established by more hand pumping. Through all this, the doctor's attention can be concentrated on the more important job of keeping the needle in place in the vein, a ticklish matter if the patient is excited and restless, while the nurse does the pumping and changes the bottles if .necessary. Emergency drugs such as coramine can be injected into the rubber connection between the bottle and the side-valve syringe without further interference with the veins. For the avoidance of unnecessary risks, the closest atten- tion to record keeping is required. The quality of the records will often distinguish a good clinic from a careless one. Four separate records are recommended. There should be a tem- perature chart, on which are entered the temperature, pulse and respiration rate daily at 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., the diet taken (as full, half, or excess), any tube feed that may have had to be given, the daily insulin dose, duration of coma and time taken to awake after interruption. Any special com- plication is marked by an asterisk on the chart. The weight recorded weekly or hi-weekly is also noted. A space is left at the side of the chart for entering the average coma dose of insulin and the maximum safe period of coma for that par- ticular patient, after these have been ascertained during the treatment. A daily treatment chart is also kept. On it are shown half- hourly records of pulse and respiration rate during treatment, the amount of sweating, the amounts of insulin and glucose given each day, the time of onset of sopor and coma and the time taken to come round after interruption. Details of the patients behaviour and neurological abnormalities in sopor and coma are also noted here. In a conspicuous and convenient position in the ward there is a treatment board. On it are marked the times of onset of sopor and coma, the time when each patient is due to be in- terrupted, the time he is actually interrupted and the time of his awakening. It is filled in as these events occur by the doctor and nurses. The important data it provides can be read at a glance from any part of the ward, and help to prevent delays and omissions when emergencies engage the attention of the staff too exclusively to one patient. It is also useful for providing the data of the more detailed and permanent records. Lastly, there should be an insulin dosage book, in which the next days doses are entered at the end of each mornings work. It is for the information of the sister or nurse in charge when giving the insulin the next morning. Before treatment is begun, it is desirable to deal with any septic foci that may be present, at least if of gross degree and fairly easily treated. There is evidence that insulin resistance is increased by even a mild infective process. Great importance should be placed on giving a correctly balanced diet during treatment. If possible, measured normal meals should be prescribed and kept approximately of the same content each day. Excess of carbohydrates in the diet enhances the probability of after-shocks by increasing insulin sensitivity. The aim should be to have every patient on a constant diet, a regular daily routine and the same length of coma each morning. When the metabolism is kept steady in this way, it is rare to get sudden changes in the response to the morning insulin or the occurrence of after-shock, Furthermore, any ominous irregularity in behaviour is more likely to be noticed and reported. If the diet taken is inadequate tube-feeding must be resorted to. It must be re- membered that a morning dose of insulin may still be in process of absorption for eighteen hours after it has been injected. Much of the treatment devolves on the nurse, and on her skill its success depends. Provided she is well chosen, the more responsibility she is given the better the standard of work she will attain. The sister and the senior nurses should be trained in all details of the technique, from the passing of the stomach-tube to the intravenous interruption, and they should be able to carry out these procedures with confidence. They learn to judge for themselves when the patient is going too deep, or showing abnormal symptoms, and to report to the doctor in time. In an emergency they are taught to act for themselves, and may have to do so if complications arise in several patients at a time and the doctors whole attention has to be concentrated on only one. If the selected male and female nursing staff are trained to a high pitch of efficiency, a greater number of patients can be treated than if the doctor has to undertake every routine procedure himself. A doctor must always be on call, but it is not necessary with a trained staff for him to be in the insulin room except during the times of sopor and coma. If the nurses have been especially well selected and trained they can even be left to handle the early stages of sopor and light coma provided the doctor can get to the treatment ward within a minute of being summoned. We give full treatment on five days a week. On the sixth half-doses of insulin are given, and the seventh is a rest day. If time is short, however, full treatment can be advantage- ously given on six days a week. The commencing dose of insulin is usually 20 units at 7 a.m. given intramuscularly by the nurse in charge, with the patient fasting from 8 p.m. the night before, and the dose is increased by this amount each day of full treatment until sopor occurs, when progression of dosage may be slower. When high doses of insulin have been reached without sopor, the jump may be 80 to 40 units each morning instead of 20 units. Once coma has been induced, the insulin dose should be adjusted until the minimum satisfactory coma dose has been found. Neglect of this principle will lead to the occurrence of irreversible comas. Insulin sensitivity frequently increases during treatment, and the regular daily dose may eventually be stabilised at half the amount that was necessary to produce the first coma. Furthermore, often enough the patient seems consciously to resist going into sopor or coma, and when he finally does so a much lower dose of insulin is needed to induce the same state on subsequent occasions. Sometimes sodium amytal gr. 3 to 6 has been given by mouth at 7 a.m. when the insulin is given. This may make the patient less restless and enable him to pass more smoothly into sopor. This dose of amytal is not enough to make the sleep induced by the drug indis- tinguishable from the hypoglycemic phenomena. Sometimes very high doses of insulin fail to produce conih at all. Then the doses must be swung. On one day 240 units should be given, and then in rotation 40, 120 and 240 units. In this way insulin sensitivity may often be increased to the point where a satisfactory coma is induced. Insulin resistance up to 600 units has, however, been reported, and the phenomena of insulin resistance are little understood. Some patients, for instance, may go into coma with as little as 40 units or even less. There is much confusion about the correct use of the word coma"". It is generally agreed that the length of time the patient is actually unconscious is the best index of the severity of a period of hypoglycemia. Yet in papers on technique daily comas of two and a half hours are recommended by some, while others advocate only three-quarters of an hour. These discrepancies are due to differences in the meaning given to the word coma. The criteria of coma given by Kuppers have been adopted in our work. He differentiates the stages of loss of consciousness into sopor or pre-coma and true coma. Because of individual variations it is generally found that reflexes, motor phenomena, and most other physical signs cannot be used as criteria of onset of either of these stages, and reliance has to be placed on tests for the presence or absence of  conscious  or purposive reactions. The onset of sopor is usually indicated by the loss of a normal response to speech and impairment of orientation. But testing will still elicit Ssome confused but purposive re- sponses. There may be some difficulty in deciding the exact time of onset of sopor from earlier degrees of hypoglyc~mia. This is not so important as to recognise when sopor deepens into coma. The onset of coma is distinguished by the loss of all purposive responses, simulating those of the conscious patient, even on careful testing. There should be no responses from visual, auditory or tactile stimuli. Painful stimuli may still produce some movements, but these are not directed towards the stimulus., Tests should include raising and dropping the patients arm, trying to make his eyes follow a moving object, and giving a painful stimulus such as pressure on the supraorbital nerve. As coma supervenes the eyes may still remain open and some non-purposive movements persist, but the absence of purposive response can always be demon- strated by testing. Some patients, while still in sopor and aware of the test stimuli, lose all initiative to respond. They must be distinguished from those in coma, and generally painful stimuli will reveal the difference. THE SECOND PHASE The second phase of treatment starts when the patient begins to go into sopor. The regulation of hypoglycaemia to achieve the maximum degree of safety is best done by con- centrating on the duration of actual coma rather than of sopor. But very occasionally hypoglycaemia has become ""irreversible when the patient is allowed to remain at the stage of apparent sopor for a very long tIme. As a precaution, therefore, interruption is carried out after an hour and a half of sopor, if coma has not supervened. When the patient has begun to go into coma the length of the coma period allowed is increased gradually from five minutes on the first day to what proves to be the maximum safe duration for the individual. Using the criteria given above, the average daily period is half an hour, with con- siderable individual variations above and below this figure. The physician should not rely on rule of thumb, but should try to discover the safety limit for each patient. He may be warned that coma is getting too deep by the patient taking over twenty minutes to awake after the nasal feed. He should be guided by this, or interrupt when other signs of excessive depth occur. As the patients physique improves with treat- ment, longer comas can be tolerated than initially; this will be indicated by changes in the depth of coma or alteration in waking time. Sometimes it may be desired to take the patient particularly deep. If this is done it is wise to interrupt immediately afterwards by the intravenous route, and not to wait a further twenty minutes or less for the patient to come round after a nasal interruptionunless after thorough testing this has been found to be safe. A particularly severe coma is also apt to cause an increased susceptibility to the next days insulin, and this must be remembered if deep comas are given. To prevent irreversible coma, a shorter coma is advised on the day following a deep coma, particularly if there have been signs of shock or delayed awakening. For the general run of patients, it is best to give a maximum safe coma treatment, and to stick to it each day until recovery is manifest. Some patients, however, do well with submaximal comas, and others need dangerously deep comas to achieve results. This is why results vary from therapist to therapist, and success depends so much on his skill. With increas- ing depth of coma comes an added risk of irreversible coma, and great skill is needed to handle this emergency, but the risk must be faced if it is necessary to the patients recovery. Our remarks apply to comas occurring at the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth hours, and are not applicable to those beginning in the fifth hour. Margins of safety must necessarily be loWer in the latter. The insulin dosage should be so adjusted as to induce coma about three hours after injection. SIGNS OF DANGER, EXCESSIVE DEPTH AND EXHAUSTION Signs of excessive depth call for interruption at any stage of coma. The peripheral circulation and blood pressure are valuable indicators of circulatory embarrassment, and re- peated examination of the finger tips is advisable. When the blood pressure falls below 100mm. or the peripheral circulation becomes poor the coma should usually be interrupted. A falling blood pressure and a rising pulse or respiration rate should always be regarded as a danger sign, especially if combined with signs of failure of peripheral circulation. Interruption must be done in good time; the tube feed may be vomited or poorly absorbed, and when intravenous inter- ruption is attempted the veins may be found to be collapsed and may then have to be cut down on. If pulse irregularities first appear during the later stages of coma and the pulse drops below 55, interruption is advisable. Earlier pulse irregularities before the onset of coma often subside with its onset, and should only require caution when they are frequent or persist for over half an hour. As a general rule, provided the blood pressure remains above 100, the pulse volume is good and the pulse between 70 and 100 per minute, these patients may be left for three-quarters of an hour before interruption. Some patients who start with extra-systoles in the initial stages of treatment lose them as treatment progresses. Motor neurological signs are of little help in determining the onset of coma, but they are useful indications of its depth. In the earlier phase various types of movement may appear; they are clinically important only if they are excessive and produce exhaustion. Occasionally they may be the pre- monitory signs of an impending fit. The movements should not be allowed to continue for over an hour and a half or less if the patient is becoming exhausted by them. Premedication with luminal gr. 1 to 2 or sodium amytal gr. 8 to 6 may help to diminish them or prevent their occurrence. If the jerking and movements are too great it is sometimes advisable to give intravenous sodium amytal gr. 2 to 3.5 at the time to reduce them. The drowsiness induced by such a small dose of intravenous amytal is easily distinguished from true coma and may enable the patient to pass through the restless phase into coma. According to Mayer-Gross severe hyperkinetic conditions, restlessness and noisy excitement, can also be controlled by giving a part or the whole of the morning insulin dose intra- venously. This brings on the deeper and quieter stages of coma more quickly. One has to learn by trial in each case how much of the total dose to give intramuscularly early on, and how much intravenously at a later stage in the days treatment. In the deeper stages of coma waves of extensor tonus occur which are well seen in the arms as combined extension and pronation. They are really important, as they indicate that the safe limit of coma is being reached. But these move- ments are often precipitated or exaggerated by respiratory embarrassment or circulatory failure. If the air passages are freed by inserting a Hewletts airway and the extensor tonus then subsides, coma may be allowed to continue. When these waves of extensor tonus are only spasmodic and the state of the circulation is satisfactory, coma may be continued for a further fifteen minutes before interruption. But to be on the safe side it may be advisable to interrupt intravenously at the end of this time and not await the slower operation of a nasal feed. If the waves persist for longer than a minute, or the circulation is poor, immediate interruption should be done. Generalised tremor when the patient is not cold is another important sign of excessive depth and calls for early inter- ruption. After going into coma sometimes the patient awakens spontaneously, generally after a period of severe spasmodic movements. If he is allowed to relapse into coma agail after this it should oniy be for half the normal length of coma, or even less, as this phenomenon may be the precursor of an irreversible coma. The condition of the reflexes is of little help in giving warning of excessive depth. More im- portant is any change from the usual ueurological pattern seen during previous comas. If unconsciousness seems deeper or the neurological pattern different from the usual for that particular patient, and the circulation is poor, interruption should be done as a precautionary measure. OTHER COMPLICATIONS Epileptic fits occur early or late in the hypoglycaemic period. The early fit occurs 45 to 100 minutes after the start of treatment and before the onset of coma. It is generally easy to manage. Often after it is over the patient wakes up spontaneously and can drink his sugared tea, or glucose can be given nasally or intravenously if he remains confused. Fits occurring in late sopor or during coma are more dangerous and may be followed, especially in the case of those occurring in the later stages of coma, by delayed recovery or severe shock. Immediate intravenous interruption is necessary for these later fits. Sometimes absorption of sugar from the stomach does not occur for some hours afterwards, and therefore further intravenous glucose may be necessary in an hours time, and even again later in the day. Fluids are valuable when signs of shock are present; up to 500 cc. of 5 per cent. glucose saline may be given after an initial 250 cc. of 33 per cent. glucose intravenously. Late fits in the stage of. coma probably indicate excessive cerebral glycopenia, and that is why they should be dealt with efficiently and rapidly. Respiratory complications occasionally arise from aspiration of saliva during coma, because of increase of salivation and diminution of protective reflexes. In the later stages of sopor and during coma the patient is best turned on his side to permit the saliva to drool out of the mouth. Respiratory stridor occurring in coma and not due to blocking of the air passages nor relieved by passage of an airway calls for im- mediate intravenous interruption as it may be a dangerous complication. Vomiting after nasal interruption can often be dealt with by giving atropine gr .001 to .02 intramuscularly some minutes before the nasal feed. It is only a dangerous complication when it indicates a condition of shock. If it does, the treat- ment of shock will be required, i.e. intravenous glucose and, if necessary, saline. INTERRUPTION In the lightest stages of hypoglycemia the patient can, as a rule, drink 600 c.c. of 33 per cent. sugared tea (for preference flavoured with lemon) at the end of treatment. In sopor and coma the same amount has to be given by means of a nasal tube. When the tube has been passed, gastric juice should be withdrawn and tested for acidity with litmus paper before the sugar is poured down the tube. When the gastric juice is only weakly acid a teaspoonful of salt is added in case chloride deficiency is being caused by excessive sweating. When coma has been deep it is unwise to allow more than twenty minutes to elapse in waiting for the patient to come round before giving glucose intravenously. This time may have to be shortened if coma remains deep or other signs of danger are present. When a skilful technique in the pre- servation of the veins and the use of the pressure bottle has been acquired, therapy may be conducted on the basis of a routine intravenous interruption. Longer and deeper comas can then be given with greater safety. The state of the veins must be kept under observation and one or two unharmed veins should be always kept in reserve for use in emergency; if thrombosis has occurred in most of the conveniently placed veins a return to nasal interruptions is indicated. In inter- ruption by the intravenous route 100 c.c. of 83 per cent. glucose is generally sufficient, but up to 250 c.c. may be given with safety. The patient receives further sugar to drink when he awakes. After the patient has come round he may be given a light breakfast. Lunch should be given about 1 p.m., tea at 4.30, and another meal in the evening. The commonest time for after shocks is about four hours after interruption. If the patient is not taking proper meals additional glucose may be given at this time as a prophylactic.. But it has already been pointed out that too great a carbohydrate preponderance in the diet is undesirable. Regular balanced supervised meals at the right times and a correct morning dose of insulin are the best prevention of after-shocks. IRREVERSIBLE COMA This is a dangerous complication in which unconsciousness persists despite the giving of adequate intravenous glucose. In severe cases there are pronounced vascular shock, hypertonus, writhing movements, and the condition resembles one of anoxia. The milder cases may merely show delayed local recovery, such as monoplegia or aphasia or a slight confusional state of short duration. The severe case may involve days of unconsciousness, but with skilful handling death should be avoided. The pathology of the condition is unknown; but treatment must be directed towards facilitating the entry of glucose into the brain cells, combating the alkalosis and anoxia, and restoration of the circulation to its maximal efficiency. We have seen great benefit from the giving of large amounts of intravenous salines in these cases. When the patient does not come round as he should with the intra- venous administration of 100 c.c. of 38 per cent, glucose, this condition must be assumed to be present; and before the needle is withdrawn an additional 150 c.c. of 33 per cent. glucose should be immediately given. If the patient still has not come round, 10 to 80 c.c. of 10 per cent. calcium chloride, 2 to 4 c.c. of coramine, 20 mgms. of vitamin B. 1, and 500 to 1000 c.c. of 5 per cent, glucose in saline should be given intra- venously, starting as soon as possible. The end of the bed should be raised, 5 per cent. CO2 in oxygen is given to the patient and warmth applied, including hot-water bottles, as for shock. After these measures the degree of shock should be subsiding, and the rectal temperature will generally rise, but the patient is often still very restless. An injection of morphia and hyoscine is useful for allaying this. An hour after the first injection a second injection of 250 c.c. of 33 per cent. glucose, together with a further 500 c.c. of saline, should be given if necessary. If treatment has been prompt and efficient, by this time the danger of acute collapse is usually past; but the patient may not recover consciousness for many hours or even days. Often absorption from the stomach starts again very slowly, and further intravenous glucose has to be given later in the day, as insulin is still being absorbed from the morning Thjection. A stomach-tube should be passed when first aid measures have been completed, and four-hourly nasal feeds of glucose are given. If these are not being absorbed they are withdrawn every four hours and fresh glucose substituted until stomach absorption restarts. Each time the previous feed is found unabsorbed, or has been vomited, 500 c.c. of 5 per cent, glucose in saline should be given intravenously. In very severe cases in which it does not appear probable that the patient will come round tor a long time a vein should be cut down on and a continuous glucose saline drip started. Blood transfusions may be given alternat- ing with the saline drip. Eucortone has been recommended. Nicotinic acid mgms. 100 four-hourly may also be given during the period of unconsciousness by the intravenous route via the continuous drip. The patients strength must be maintained by intravenous feeding till stomach absorption restarts. With prompt treatment recovery from this condition gener- ally takes place in the first twenty-four hours; but a period of unconsciousness lasting six days has been seen, when the doctor had failed to institute emergency measures immediately. After long periods of unconsciousness very marked impair- ment of intellectual functions will be seen, but a surprising degree of recovery from this will occur in succeeding weeks and months. Following short-lived irreversible comas some dramatic improvements in schizophrenic symptomatology have been recorded. If, with effective measures, the patient has emerged rapidly from irreversible coma, the fact that the complication has occurred does not imply that treatment should be abandoned. It may be started again in three or four days time, but thereafter the comas must be kept much shorter. On several occasions we have known treatment, started again under these circumstances, to proceed without further mischance to a successful conclusion. CLINICAL CHANGES PRODUCED BY TREATMENT In patients who are going to react well to the treatment it will generally be found that after the first few comas, wakening from coma leads to an hour or two of a considerably improved mental state. Sometimes in the early case improvement occurs without the coma stage having been reached. The most prominent change is a great improvement in rapport and the affective attitude. For a time the patient regards the doctor and the nurses in a much warmer and more friendly manner, suspicion is for the moment in abeyance, and there is often a considerable degree of insight into the delusions, feel- ings of unreality, etc. After this short interval, however, the patient sinks back into his old state, and remains in it for the rest of the day. Patients who are excited, agitated or panicky are often much improved in this respect for a longer period of time. As the days of treatment succeed one another the beneficial change lasts longer, and the state into which the patient relapses becomes less hind less severe, until gradually the improvement is maximal. In the most fortunate patients this may occur with astonishing rapidity, less than a fortnight of intensive therapy sufficing to bring about what appears to be a complete cure. In order to judge whether the maximum amount of benefit has been gained it is necessary to have a very thorough knowledge of the patients symptoms and clinical state before beginning treatment. As improvement takes place delusions and other morbid ideas which have hitherto been concealed may be brought to the light of day, and give a false im- pression to the naive that the state is becoming more acute. A very careful clinical examination should be repeated when the termination of treatment is being considered; and treat- ment should not be stopped if there are any signs of activity of the disease, unless it is thought hopeless to proceed any further. By this it is not meant that the patient must have full insight into the symptoms of the past, but that there should not still be hallucinations occurring, or feelings of influence or passivity, etc. Furthermore, it is probably desirable to continue a more modified form of insulin treatment until the patient has regained the physique that is normal and healthy for him. It is quite possible that relapse is more likely, even when there is complete restoration of mental normality, if a really good state of bodily health has not been regained. Mental im- provement and physical improvement usually go side by side, but one may lag a bit behind the other. If the patient regains his normal weight and physical state, and retains his mental symptoms unaltered, it is a bad sign, and it is usually not worth proceeding much further. Most favourable cases respond to treatment within two months. Sometimes recovery seems to occur two to four weeks after treatment has been completed. If no change has been brought about in three months, and every therapeutic trick has been tried, it is unlikely that there will be a favourable outcome, USE OF CONVULSIVE THERAPY WITH INSULIN Although convulsive therapy is no method of treatment of the schizophrenic psychosis itself, it can often play an adjuvant part, and be particularly useful for dealing with individual symptoms. Depression in schizophrenia, as in basically different disorders, is often much improved by a few electrical fits; and their use before the treatment proper is begun may allow the patient to be more easily treated, and may, if neces- sary, permit the physician to get a clearer perception of how much schizophrenic disturbance there is actually present. Depression in schizophrenia is a secondary symptom, possibly partly psychogenic in origin, possibly partly a result of the metabolic changes that are having a total effect on the patients health; but the intensity of the affective change may obscure the realisation of the more fundamental and ominous symptoms. The hypothymia, lassitude and anergia, which are more directly related to the schizophrenic process may also clear up under the influence of a few convulsions, which are more likely to be required for that purpose after the termination of insulin treatment than before it has begun. Catatonic stupor usually yields to convulsive therapy, but sometimes passes into a catatonic excitement. Convulsions should then be used if there is doubt of the diagnosis, or if the catatonic state interferes with the practical details of insulin therapy, e.g. in the intake of an adequate diet, Qr if the condition fails to respond fairly rapidly to insulin and a depressive component is suspected. The insulin treatment will itself be nearly always required to establish ground gained by convulsive therapy, and to prevent the possibility of rapid relapse. Insulin will also remedy sympl~ms of thought disorder untouched by convulsions. There is some evidence that a few convulsions may be of benefit during the course of insulin treatment, for instance when the patient has started to improve, but has failed to maintain improvement. Where the two treatments are combined they should be given separately and not on the same day. The role of convulsive therapy in schizophrenia is therefore a supplementary but important one; the improvements claimed in the past from convulsions alone have mostly been symp- tomatic ones without significance for the course of the disease, or have proved temporary. Some of the few apparent cures may well have occurred in what were fundamentally depressive illnesses, with a schizoid colouring derived from the structure of the personality. The highest recovery rate in any large and varied group of cases .initiaiiy diagnosed as schizophrenia will be achieved when insulin and convulsion therapy are skilfully combined in differing proportions in each case, based on the actual symptomatology shown. PSYCHOTHERAPY In our view the time has passed when one can legitimately treat schizophrenia by non-physical methods alone, and the claims that are from time to time made of the necessity of combining psychotherapy with insulin treatment seem to be exaggerated. Many patients make an uninterrupted recovery under insulin treatment without any special psycho- therapeutic handling whatever. The apparent psychological precipitants of a schizophrenic illness are frequently found when the insight gained into the illness is fairly complete to have been not part causes of the illness but the earliest signs of its onset. The type of psychotherapy that is most required with the schizophrenic patient is of a kind that might be found valuable after any grave physical illness. Once he is re- covered the patient has to return to the outside world and try to manage his own affairs without the constant advice of the doctor; it will often help if the way is made a little smoother for him. While the disease is in active progress it is hopeless to try to influence the patients ways of thinking; but it is not so hopeless when the fundamental thought disorder has been abolished, and there are only a few fragmentary delusional beliefs, suspicions or foci of apprehension which are left over as relics from the past. It is probably beneficial to get into contact with the patient during the best half hour or so of the day immediately on wakening after treatment, and to give him then the im- pression of friendly assistance, even though, as is probable, any influence one can exert on his morbid ideas is of the most trifling duration. As soon as he is well enough he should be kept fully occupied in the afternoon with occupation therapy, gardening, games, walks, visits to the cinema, and so on. When recovery has occurred the possibilities of explanation and reassurance are much more favourable. The patient will probably have a very clear memory for a time of his many morbid experiences, and will be anxious to get some explanation for them. Reassurance will also often be required on the subject of relapse. It should not be concealed from the patient that relapse may occur, but he should be told that the prospects of treatment need be no worse, should a relapse occur, than they have been with his first illness, and that if he only seeks advice in the early days of such a recurrence, they are bright indeed; he should, of course, on the other hand, be encouraged not to worry about himself, nor to keep forever a finger on the pulse of his mind. FOLLOW-UP When recovery has occurred it is advisable to discharge the patient from hospital as rapidly as possible. Return to the normal environment, and an abbreviated recollection of the hospital atmosphere will aid the patient in the recovery of his self-confidence and powers of adaptation. But it is ad- visable to keep an eye on the patient in an out-patient clinic fairly regularly for a month or so, and then it is wise to ask for three-monthly attendances for another year. If there is the slightest sign of any relapse it should be promptly dealt with, and though a relapse may occur at any time up to many years later, it is most likely to occur fairly soon.

Multi-dimensional Transcriptional Remodeling by Physiological Insulin In Vivo,"IntroductionInsulin is the primary hormone controlling the balance between an anabolic and catabolic state. This occurs through regulation of a range of physiological processes involved in metabolism, growth, differentiation, and cell survival (Boucher et al., 2014Boucher J. Kleinridders A. Kahn C.R. Insulin receptor signaling in normal and insulin-resistant states., Tokarz et al., 2018Tokarz V.L. MacDonald P.E. Klip A. The cell biology of systemic insulin function.). At the cellular level, insulin activates the insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase, which triggers two major downstream pathways: the IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which regulates most of insulin's metabolic actions, and the SHC/RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which regulates growth and differentiation (Haeusler et al., 2018Haeusler R.A. McGraw T.E. Accili D. Biochemical and cellular properties of insulin receptor signalling., Taniguchi et al., 2006Taniguchi C.M. Emanuelli B. Kahn C.R. Critical nodes in signalling pathways: insights into insulin action.). In both its metabolic and growth-promoting actions, insulin regulates the expression of many genes, both through direct effects on gene transcription and through indirect effects secondary to changing levels of blood glucose and other hormones.During fasting, for example, when insulin levels are low and glucagon and glucocorticoid levels are high, the promoter of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) gene, a key mediator of hepatic gluconeogenesis, is occupied by multiple transcriptional activators, including FOXO1 and FOXO3, FOXA2, SRC-1, CBP/p300, HNF4α, glucocorticoid receptor, and the co-activator PGC1α (). Feeding, which increases insulin and decreases glucagon levels, induces rapid, phosphorylation-dependent removal of most of these factors from Pck1 promoter, leading to suppression of gluconeogenesis, but to what extent this is the result of increased insulin action versus decreased glucagon action is unclear.Global mRNA profiling approaches have been useful in identifying insulin-regulated genes in both cell lines and tissues taken from animals before and after insulin administration, during fasting and refeeding, or in the context of insulin resistance (Boucher et al., 2010Boucher J. Tseng Y.H. Kahn C.R. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors act as ligand-specific amplitude modulators of a common pathway regulating gene transcription., Fazakerley et al., 2018Fazakerley D.J. Chaudhuri R. Yang P. Maghzal G.J. Thomas K.C. Krycer J.R. Humphrey S.J. Parker B.L. Fisher-Wellman K.H. Meoli C.C. et al.Mitochondrial CoQ deficiency is a common driver of mitochondrial oxidants and insulin resistance., Yang et al., 2016Yang L. Li P. Yang W. Ruan X. Kiesewetter K. Zhu J. Cao H. Integrative Transcriptome Analyses of Metabolic Responses in Mice Define Pivotal LncRNA Metabolic Regulators.). However, these studies have limitations in the interpretation, because all of these manipulations result in changes of glucose levels, as well as levels of other hormones and metabolites. The gold standard method for assessing insulin action isolated from these other effects is the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (Kim, 2009Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to assess insulin sensitivity in vivo.). In this regard, some microarray-based profiling of mRNAs has been performed in skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy and insulin-resistant human subjects undergoing hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (Coletta et al., 2008Coletta D.K. Balas B. Chavez A.O. Baig M. Abdul-Ghani M. Kashyap S.R. Folli F. Tripathy D. Mandarino L.J. Cornell J.E. et al.Effect of acute physiological hyperinsulinemia on gene expression in human skeletal muscle in vivo., Rome et al., 2003Rome S. Clément K. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Loizon E. Poitou C. Barsh G.S. Riou J.P. Laville M. Vidal H. Microarray profiling of human skeletal muscle reveals that insulin regulates approximately 800 genes during a hyperinsulinemic clamp., Sears et al., 2009Sears D.D. Hsiao G. Hsiao A. Yu J.G. Courtney C.H. Ofrecio J.M. Chapman J. Subramaniam S. Mechanisms of human insulin resistance and thiazolidinedione-mediated insulin sensitization.); however, little has been done using more comprehensive approaches like RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which allows measurement of all transcripts, including multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and the expression of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species. Likewise, in the human studies, there was no assessment of insulin regulation of gene expression in the liver due to sampling limitations.To address gene expression changes induced by insulin under constant blood glucose levels, where the effects of counter-regulatory hormones are minimized, we have performed transcriptomic analysis in muscle and liver isolated from mice during a euglycemic clamp. We find that insulin regulates &gt;1,000 transcripts in muscle and liver. These changes involve many well-known pathways related to energy metabolism, development, and autophagy, as well as previously unrecognized pathways, including chromatin remodeling and multiple ncRNAs, many of these with unknown function. Knockdown of selected long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) identified by lncRNA-mRNA correlation analysis in hepatocytes reveals a role for Gm15441 in regulation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and lipid accumulation. Thus, the response to physiological insulin levels in vivo is associated with a multi-level network of tissue-specific regulation of coding and ncRNAs producing the broad, pleiotropic actions of the hormone.DiscussionLoss of transcriptional integrity in response to insulin deficiency is linked to many features of uncontrolled diabetes (Patti, 2004Gene expression in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus., Sears et al., 2009Sears D.D. Hsiao G. Hsiao A. Yu J.G. Courtney C.H. Ofrecio J.M. Chapman J. Subramaniam S. Mechanisms of human insulin resistance and thiazolidinedione-mediated insulin sensitization.). While much is known from in vitro studies about insulin regulation of gene expression, establishing a comprehensive view of insulin-regulated transcriptional networks in vivo in a tissue-specific manner is more difficult, because glucose homeostasis involves a complex metabolic response of insulin, multiple counter-regulatory hormones, and other metabolites. In the present study, we have assessed the effects of insulin on gene expression at constant blood glucose levels by performing euglycemic clamps at low and high physiological levels of insulin comparable to those observed after feeding or during an oral glucose challenge. We find that in both muscle and liver, insulin acutely regulates a broad and multi-dimensional network of gene expression.Although the euglycemic clamp is the best available method to assess insulin action at constant blood glucose levels and with minimal counter-regulation (Kim, 2009Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to assess insulin sensitivity in vivo.), there are methodological considerations. First, constant insulin infusion does not recapitulate the dynamic nature of insulin secretion, which may be more efficient in regulation of insulin action (Matveyenko et al., 2012Matveyenko A.V. Liuwantara D. Gurlo T. Kirakossian D. Dalla Man C. Cobelli C. White M.F. Copps K.D. Volpi E. Fujita S. Butler P.C. Pulsatile portal vein insulin delivery enhances hepatic insulin action and signaling.). Second, by its nature, a clamp is based on peripheral insulin delivery, whereas physiologically insulin is secreted into the portal vein, thus changing the balance of effects in muscle compared to liver (Farmer et al., 2015Farmer T.D. Jenkins E.C. O'Brien T.P. McCoy G.A. Havlik A.E. Nass E.R. Nicholson W.E. Printz R.L. Shiota M. Comparison of the physiological relevance of systemic vs. portal insulin delivery to evaluate whole body glucose flux during an insulin clamp.). Third, repeated tail tip blood sampling may have an impact on catecholamine levels, although this would also affect the control mice receiving saline (Ayala et al., 2006Ayala J.E. Bracy D.P. McGuinness O.P. Wasserman D.H. Considerations in the design of hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in the conscious mouse.).In muscle, mitochondria are a major target of insulin's transcriptional actions, with coordinate regulation of both nuclear and mtDNA transcripts linked to glucose utilization through the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as recruitment of genes involved in glycogenesis and triglyceride synthesis for glucose storage. This transcriptional response is consistent with the role of insulin in muscle as the major site of glucose disposal during the clamp (Thiebaud et al., 1982Thiebaud D. Jacot E. DeFronzo R.A. Maeder E. Jequier E. Felber J.P. The effect of graded doses of insulin on total glucose uptake, glucose oxidation, and glucose storage in man.). The nuclear receptor ERRα is a likely a major upstream regulator of the transcriptional response to insulin associated with mitochondrial metabolism, as indicated by enrichment of ERRα binding sites within promoters of many insulin-regulated genes involved with oxidative metabolism and by increased mRNA levels of the transcriptional co-activator Ppargc1b (PGC1β), which is essential for ERRα activity (Mootha et al., 2004Mootha V.K. Handschin C. Arlow D. Xie X. St Pierre J. Sihag S. Yang W. Altshuler D. Puigserver P. Patterson N. et al.Erralpha and Gabpa/b specify PGC-1alpha-dependent oxidative phosphorylation gene expression that is altered in diabetic muscle.), as well as increased levels of the ERRα downstream target Perm1 (Cho et al., 2013Cho Y. Hazen B.C. Russell A.P. Kralli A. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1)- and estrogen-related receptor (ERR)-induced regulator in muscle 1 (Perm1) is a tissue-specific regulator of oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle cells.) in the insulin-stimulated state. In addition to control of glucose utilization, a major function of insulin in muscle is prevention of protein breakdown (Abdulla et al., 2016Abdulla H. Smith K. Atherton P.J. Idris I. Role of insulin in the regulation of human skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown: a systematic review and meta-analysis.). Consistent with this anticatabolic function, during the clamp there is suppression of autophagy genes and E3-ubiquitin ligases. These major pathways regulating muscle proteostasis have been shown to be controlled by FoxO transcription factors (O'Neill et al., 2019O'Neill B.T. Bhardwaj G. Penniman C.M. Krumpoch M.T. Suarez Beltran P.A. Klaus K. Poro K. Li M. Pan H. Dreyfuss J.M. et al.FoxO Transcription Factors are Critical Regulators of Diabetes-Related Muscle Atrophy., Sandri et al., 2004Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Foxo transcription factors induce the atrophy-related ubiquitin ligase atrogin-1 and cause skeletal muscle atrophy.). Several insulin-regulated autophagy genes (including Ulk1 and Tbc1d17) showed enrichment for FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 binding sites on promoter regions, consistent with highest FOXO1/3 phosphorylation at 3 h.Impaired expression of genes involved in oxidative metabolism is observed in muscle from subjects with type 1 diabetes (Karakelides et al., 2007Karakelides H. Asmann Y.W. Bigelow M.L. Short K.R. Dhatariya K. Coenen-Schimke J. Kahl J. Mukhopadhyay D. Nair K.S. Effect of insulin deprivation on muscle mitochondrial ATP production and gene transcript levels in type 1 diabetic subjects.) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Mootha et al., 2003Mootha V.K. Lindgren C.M. Eriksson K.F. Subramanian A. Sihag S. Lehar J. Puigserver P. Carlsson E. Ridderstråle M. Laurila E. et al.PGC-1alpha-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes., Patti et al., 2003Patti M.E. Butte A.J. Crunkhorn S. Cusi K. Berria R. Kashyap S. Miyazaki Y. Kohane I. Costello M. Saccone R. et al.Coordinated reduction of genes of oxidative metabolism in humans with insulin resistance and diabetes: Potential role of PGC1 and NRF1.). Intersection of genes regulated by insulin in muscle during the clamp with data from STZ and HFD models reveals that downregulation of mitochondrial function genes related to TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in diabetes is linked to impaired insulin action. The relationship between insulin resistance and diabetic state on gene expression is illustrated by comparing mice with IR knockout in muscle (MIRKO) and mice made diabetic by STZ treatment (Yechoor et al., 2004Yechoor V.K. Patti M.E. Ueki K. Laustsen P.G. Saccone R. Rauniyar R. Kahn C.R. Distinct pathways of insulin-regulated versus diabetes-regulated gene expression: an in vivo analysis in MIRKO mice.). In this comparison, genes of oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated by STZ diabetes but remain unchanged upon muscle-specific deletion of the IR, indicating that metabolic factors other than insulin resistance are involved in the downregulation of mitochondrial genes. Insulin replacement restores gene expression in lox-STZ mice, but not in MIRKO-STZ mice, indicating that insulin action provides an initiating force in this gene regulation.In the liver, insulin upregulates genes involved in steroid and cholesterol biosynthesis and downregulates pathways related to glucose production and fatty acid catabolism. In terms of suppression of endogenous production in liver, insulin action to phosphorylate FOXO1 plays a central role in increasing Gck transcription while suppressing G6pc levels (Haeusler et al., 2014Haeusler R.A. Hartil K. Vaitheesvaran B. Arrieta-Cruz I. Knight C.M. Cook J.R. Kammoun H.L. Febbraio M.A. Gutierrez-Juarez R. Kurland I.J. Accili D. Integrated control of hepatic lipogenesis versus glucose production requires FoxO transcription factors.). Insulin resistance in liver due to deletion of the IR or its downstream partners, IRS proteins or AKT1/AKT2, is characterized by unrestrained gluconeogenesis, and this can be reversed by liver-specific deletion of FOXO1 (Lu et al., 2012Lu M. Wan M. Leavens K.F. Chu Q. Monks B.R. Fernandez S. Ahima R.S. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. Birnbaum M.J. Insulin regulates liver metabolism in vivo in the absence of hepatic Akt and Foxo1., Matsumoto et al., 2007Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Impaired regulation of hepatic glucose production in mice lacking the forkhead transcription factor Foxo1 in liver., O-Sullivan et al., 2015O-Sullivan I. Zhang W. Wasserman D.H. Liew C.W. Liu J. Paik J. DePinho R.A. Stolz D.B. Kahn C.R. Schwartz M.W. Unterman T.G. FoxO1 integrates direct and indirect effects of insulin on hepatic glucose production and glucose utilization.). In our study, the involvement of FOXOs in the transcriptional response to insulin in the liver is indicated by increase of FOXO1 and FOXO3 phosphorylation in association with coordinate upregulation of Gck and downregulation of G6pc and other canonical FOXO targets in the liver, such as Pck1, Igfbp1, and Ppargc1a.HNFs also appear to mediate part of the transcriptional effects of insulin in liver metabolism. During the 3 h clamp, insulin increases the expression of Foxa2 (HNF3β), Foxa3 (HNF3γ), Onecut1 (HNF6α), and Onecut2 (HNF6β) in the liver, and promoters of several regulated genes are enriched for HNF1 and HNF4 binding motifs. Insulin has been shown to also regulate liver transcription factors at the post-translational level, such as by promoting the inhibitory phosphorylation of FOXA2 at Thr156 by AKT, resulting in nuclear exclusion and suppression of gluconeogenesis genes (Wolfrum et al., 2003Wolfrum C. Besser D. Luca E. Stoffel M. Insulin regulates the activity of forkhead transcription factor Hnf-3beta/Foxa-2 by Akt-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear/cytosolic localization.), and through FOXO1 phosphorylation, which disrupts an inhibitory interaction with HNF4α, thus promoting its transcriptional activity (Hirota et al., 2008Hirota K. Sakamaki J. Ishida J. Shimamoto Y. Nishihara S. Kodama N. Ohta K. Yamamoto M. Tanimoto K. Fukamizu A. A combination of HNF-4 and Foxo1 is required for reciprocal transcriptional regulation of glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase genes in response to fasting and feeding.). Thus, HNFs, in combination with FOXOs, play important roles in determining the transcriptional response to insulin in the liver.Control of lipid metabolism is a central metabolic function of insulin and occurs with different transcriptional profiles in muscle and liver. In liver, 3 h insulin stimulation downregulates the rate-limiting FAO enzymes Cpt1a and Cpt2 and increases genes involved in steroid and cholesterol biosynthesis (Hmgcs1 and Sqle), while mRNA levels of the major lipogenic genes remain unchanged at this time point. In muscle, insulin increases expression of enzymes of triglyceride synthesis (Gk and Dgat2), as well as genes involved in de novo lipogenesis (Fasn and Acly). Most lipogenic actions of insulin are controlled by the sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs), with SREBP1c being more selective toward fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis and SREBP2 stimulation of cholesterol synthesis (Horton et al., 2002Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. SREBPs: activators of the complete program of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver.). Although the active SREBP1 isoform is induced by insulin in both tissues, the transcriptional profile from liver is most consistent with SREBP2 activation, whereas in muscle, SREBP1c is likely the dominant isoform. This agrees with previous observations of impaired SREBP2-mediated cholesterogenic gene expression in livers lacking IR expression specifically in hepatocytes (Miao et al., 2014Miao J. Haas J.T. Manthena P. Wang Y. Zhao E. Vaitheesvaran B. Kurland I.J. Biddinger S.B. Hepatic insulin receptor deficiency impairs the SREBP-2 response to feeding and statins.). Motif analysis also indicate potential SREBP1 target genes involved in functions other than lipid metabolism, including transcription, chromatin modification, and notch and wnt signaling that are suppressed during the clamp. This is in line with previous reports of downregulation of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, cytochrome P450, and IRS-2-mediated signaling by SREBPs (Ide et al., 2004Ide T. Shimano H. Yahagi N. Matsuzaka T. Nakakuki M. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa Y. Takahashi A. Suzuki H. Sone H. et al.SREBPs suppress IRS-2-mediated insulin signalling in the liver., Jang et al., 2016Jang H. Lee G.Y. Selby C.P. Lee G. Jeon Y.G. Lee J.H. Cheng K.K. Titchenell P. Birnbaum M.J. Xu A. et al.SREBP1c-CRY1 signalling represses hepatic glucose production by promoting FOXO1 degradation during refeeding., Yamamoto et al., 2004Yamamoto T. Shimano H. Nakagawa Y. Ide T. Yahagi N. Matsuzaka T. Nakakuki M. Takahashi A. Suzuki H. Sone H. et al.SREBP-1 interacts with hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha and interferes with PGC-1 recruitment to suppress hepatic gluconeogenic genes.).Another aspect of metabolic regulation revealed by this study is the important role of insulin in regulation of ncRNAs. ncRNAs have gained increased attention in genetic research, because more than 85% of SNPs associated with T2D occur in non-coding intronic or intergenic regions of the genome (Jenkinson et al., 2015Jenkinson C.P. Göring H.H. Arya R. Blangero J. Duggirala R. DeFronzo R.A. Transcriptomics in type 2 diabetes: Bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype.). In addition, dysregulated expression of lncRNAs has been demonstrated under diabetic conditions (He et al., 2017He X. Ou C. Xiao Y. Han Q. Li H. Zhou S. LncRNAs: key players and novel insights into diabetes mellitus.). However, a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA regulation by metabolic signals and downstream functions is lacking. We find that lncRNA regulation accounts for a significant part of the transcriptional response to insulin in muscle and liver. This is not limited to the clamp but is also observed by physiological insulin oscillations induced by fasting and refeeding. One such example is Gm15441, which is upregulated &gt;100-fold by fasting and promptly returns to basal levels after refeeding, consistent with its downregulation during the clamp. This is in line with an upregulation of this lncRNA in livers of mice on a ketogenic diet, which lowers insulin levels (Newman et al., 2017Newman J.C. Covarrubias A.J. Zhao M. Yu X. Gut P. Ng C.P. Huang Y. Haldar S. Verdin E. Ketogenic Diet Reduces Midlife Mortality and Improves Memory in Aging Mice.).Correlation between levels of Gm15441 with expression of FAO genes suggested a role for this lncRNA in regulating lipid metabolism. Knockdown of Gm15441 lowered palmitic acid-derived CO2 and ketone body formation. Further studies are needed to determine precisely how Gm15441 regulates lipid metabolism, but our study provides two important facets of this mechanism. First, PPAR nuclear receptors are likely to be involved, because the expression of Ppar gamma and its co-activator PGC1α are downregulated by more than 50% upon knockdown of Gm15441. Although FAO is linked to Ppar alpha, whose expression was unchanged in our knockdown experiments, previous studies have shown that lower levels of PGC1 in the liver can also affect FAO (Chambers et al., 2012Chambers K.T. Chen Z. Crawford P.A. Fu X. Burgess S.C. Lai L. Leone T.C. Kelly D.P. Finck B.N. Liver-specific PGC-1beta deficiency leads to impaired mitochondrial function and lipogenic response to fasting-refeeding., Estall et al., 2009Estall J.L. Kahn M. Cooper M.P. Fisher F.M. Wu M.K. Laznik D. Qu L. Cohen D.E. Shulman G.I. Spiegelman B.M. Sensitivity of lipid metabolism and insulin signaling to genetic alterations in hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha expression.). Second, the lack of regulation of neighboring genes upon Gm15441 and Gm15663 knockdown and the different chromosomal location of potential targets PPARγ and PGC1α from these lncRNAs suggest a long-range trans acting mechanism.In conclusion, insulin promotes rapid and tissue-specific remodeling of gene transcription in vivo involving multiple layers of regulation. These changes extend include aspects not previously linked to diabetes, such as transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism by ncRNAs. This network of gene regulation provides potential targets for therapeutic approaches involving insulin action in muscle and liver.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by NIH grants R37DK031036, R01DK033201 (to C.R.K.), P30DK036836 (to Joslin Diabetes Center), and 5U2C-DK093000 (to J.K.K.) and the Mary K.

Upon transfer to the cardiac surgery division, if fasting glucose was ≥130 mg/dl, a basal + premeal insulin therapy was initiated (121 patients, group 1); for &lt;130 mg/dl, a premeal insulin alone was initiated (691 patients, group 2).FindingsCompared with group 2, group 1 showed reductions in PIC (2.48% vs 7.96%, p &lt; 0.049; odds ratio: 0.294; 95% CI: 0.110–0.780), C-Reactive Protein (p &lt; 0.05) and white blood cell (p &lt; 0.05) levels despite glucose levels and CIII that were higher during the first two days after surgery (179.8 ± 25.3 vs 169.5 ± 10.6 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.01; 0.046 ± 0.008 vs 0.037 ± 0.015 U/kg/h, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Normal glucose levels were achieved in both groups from day 3 before the discharge. The mean length of hospital duration was 18% lower in group 1 than in group 2 (7.21 ± 05.08 vs 8.76 ± 9.08 days, p &lt; 0.007), providing a significant impact on public health costs.ConclusionsBasal + preprandial insulin therapy was associated with a lower frequency of PIC than preprandial insulin therapy alone, suggesting a beneficial effect of basal insulin therapy on post-surgery outcome.Abbreviations: PIC, postoperative infective complications; BIT, basal insulin therapy; PCP, perioperative cardiosurgery period; CIII, continuous intravenous insulin infusion; DM, diabetes mellitus; ICU, intensive care units; CRP, C-Reactive Protein; WBC, white blood cellKeywords: Insulin therapy, Cardiac surgery, Post-surgery infections, Hyperglycemia, HypoglycemiaIntroductionIt is well recognized that inadequate perioperative glucose control is a predictor of postoperative infection rates, worse wound healing, recurrent ischemic events, increased duration of hospital stay and overall short- and long-term mortality [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].The benefit of glucose control for patients undergoing surgery has been shown in many previous studies. Following cardiac surgery glucose control provides benefits even to patients without pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM) [1], [5], [6]. However, intensive insulin therapy is consistently associated with increased risk for severe hypoglycemia, which may outweigh the potential benefits of reducing blood glucose [7].According to the current published guidelines, a glycemic goal of 140–180 mg/dl is optimal in intensive care units (ICU) while tighter control of circulating glucose (110–140 mg/dl) may be appropriate in selected patients, as long as this can be achieved without a significant risk for hypoglycemia [8]. On the other hand, several studies have found an important association between hyperglycemia and susceptibility to bacterial infection [9], [10], although the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Animal studies have shown that insulin modulates the production and release of cytokines, the expression of adhesion molecules and neutrophil migration during the course of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung inflammation [11]. Therefore, it could be possible that an increase in circulating insulin levels by exogenous insulin therapy could be beneficial in the perioperative setting. According with the knowledge of physiologic insulin secretion, we evolved into the use of regimens that incorporate both the basal and bolus insulin therapy.In agreement with this hypothesis, intensive insulin therapy reduces morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients [5], [12] and may increase neutrophil activity and phagocytosis in patients following major surgery [13]. On the other hand, it is very difficult to differentiate the effect of insulin per se on the postoperative infective complications from the effects which insulin has in reducing these risks through lowering blood sugar levels.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a retrospective analysis to determine the association between a constant increase in insulin levels by the use of basal insulin therapy, independent of glucose levels, and a possible improvement of postoperative infective complications after cardiac surgery. This study selected patients admitted for cardiac interventions, where a continuous intravenous insulin infusion (CIII) for an acute increase of glucose levels was undertaken. On the day of the transfer of the patient to the cardiac surgery unit patients were divided into two groups: in one group, where fasting glucose was ≥130 mg/dl, a basal + premeal insulin was started. In the other group, where fasting glucose was &lt;130 mg/dl, premeal insulin alone was administered. This allowed the comparison of the effect of a constant versus an intermittent increase in insulin levels on post cardiac-surgery infections.Secondary outcomes included differences between treatment groups in daily circulating glucose concentration, the occurrence of mild or severe hypoglycemia, the length of hospital stay and the occurrence of any of the following post-surgery complications: stroke, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, heart failure, low cardiac output syndrome, acute atrial fibrillation, anemia or exitus.Materials and methodsElegible populationThis was a retrospective chart review from a single cardiac surgery center. Patients who had undergone cardiac surgery were identified according to these inclusion criteria and they had to meet both 1 and 2:1)patients with or without DM admitted for cardiac surgery due to mitral or aortic valve disease, affected by ischemic heart disease, or both;2)patients, who during the cardiac surgery intervention period, required treatment with continuous intravenous insulin infusion (CIII) for an acute increase of circulating glucose levels (blood glucose ≥130 mg/dl on two assessments during surgery);Exclusion criteria were:1)Patients with cancer, undergoing chronically outpatient steroid therapy, or with type-1 DM.2)Patients with clinically relevant hepatic disease, with serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dl, or with a history of hyperglycemia before admission during the last 3 months (HbA1c &gt; 10%).From January 2009 to December 2011, 2114 patients underwent surgery in the cardiac division (cardiac valve repair or replace surgery alone in 1637 patients, cardiac revascularization surgery alone in 284 patients or both cardiac revascularization surgery and cardiac valve repair or replace surgery in 193 patients).Among these, 812 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and were analyzed and the clinical characteristics of this population are presented in .Table 1Clinical characteristics and medical history of patients requiring continuous intravenous insulin infusion during the cardiac surgery period for an acute increase of circulating glucose levels (blood glucose was ≥130 mg/dl on two assessments during surgery) from 01 March 2009 to 30 November 2011.No. of patients812Period of hospitalization01 March 2009 to 30 November 2011Age (years)62.50 ± 11.50Sex (Males/Females)511/302No. of patients with valve disease (VD)633No. of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD)96No. of patients with VD and IHD83Co-morbidities: Diabetes mellitus95 Hypertension674Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease85 Chronic atrial fibrillation195Body weight (kg)73.04 ± 14.03Body mass index (kg/m2)25.62 ± 4.15Fasting glucose (mg/dl)*100.3 ± 23.7Glycated Hemoglobin (%)*5.52 ± 1.38Creatinine (mg/dl)*0.92 ± 0.37BUN (mg/dl)*46.92 ± 18.85Plasma albumin (mg/dl)*41.49 ± 3.84Hemoglobin (g/dl)*13.58 ± 1.62Study designAll subjects underwent cardiac surgeries including mitral valve replacement/repair, aortic valve replacement/repair, cardiac revascularization surgery or a combination of the aforementioned surgeries.Consultation with a diabetologist was performed daily throughout the pre-operative, perioperative and post-surgery period to optimize the insulin therapy.During the surgery period, if the blood glucose was ≥130 mg/dl on two assessments, a CIII was initiated and continued after transfer to the cardiovascular intensive care unit. Glucose was assessed hourly by arterial blood gases intra-operatively and every 30–120 min while in the cardiovascular intensive care unit. The same insulin infusion protocol was continued postoperatively, using the same criteria with a blood glucose target of ≤120 mg/dl. If the blood glucose reached ≤80 mg/dl, the infusion was halted and restarted only if the threshold of 130 mg/dl was reached again.On the day of transfer from the cardiovascular intensive care unit to the cardiac surgery division, patients were fasting and the insulin infusion was stopped, if present. After 3–4 h, if the capillary fasting glucose levels were ≥130 mg/dl a basal + premeal insulin therapy was started. This occurred with 121 patients (isophane, i.e., protophane every 12 h, in 69 patients, detemir every 12 h in 50 patients and glargine every 24 h in 2 patients; group 1). The initial insulin dose of basal insulin was determined as 50% of the estimated insulin requirements of the previous 24 h, during the cardiovascular intensive care unit period (usually between 0.2 to 0.5 U/kg body weight). Conversely, if the capillary fasting glucose was &lt;130 mg/dl, a premeal insulin alone administration was started (691 patients; group 2). The doses of premeal insulin (aspart insulin) therapy were adjusted according to a pre-specified protocol (breakfast: 0.05–0.10 U/kg, lunch: 0.10–0.30 U/kg; dinner 0.10–0.20 U/kg).The decision to start insulin therapy if baseline blood sugar levels were above 130 mg/dl in these patients was contained in the internal guidelines established since 2008 from doctors diabetologists and physicians of surgical departments, endorsed by the Institute's Health Department. The ability to start insulin sc therapy at levels ≥130 mg/dl was based on the daily valuation of diabetologists who interacted with nurses and doctors of the department so as to optimize insulin therapy and reduce the possible hypoglycemic episodes.There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding age, gender, BMI, creatinine, BUN, plasma albumin, hemoglobin and other co-morbidities except for the presence of DM in group 1, which was significantly higher than in group 2 (19.8% vs 9.6%, p &lt; 0.01). However, fasting glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin were not significantly different, being 100.1 ± 22.1 mg/dl and 5.55 ± 1.23% in group 1 and 100.9 ± 23.8 mg/dl and 5.51 ± 1.41% in group 2 (p = 0.93 and p = 0.69, respectively, ).Table 2Clinical Characteristics and co-morbidities of patients.

All blood glucose check times were standardized and occurred at 7:30 am (fasting, before breakfast), 12:00 pm (before lunch), 6:00 pm (before dinner) and 12:00 am.Outcome measuresThe primary outcome of the study was the difference between treatment groups in the composite of major postoperative infective complications according to Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network Criteria determined by chart review for each patient [14]: deep incisional surgical infection, mediastinitis, infection endocarditis, cardiac device infection, pneumonia and bloodstream infection.The secondary outcomes determined by chart review for each patient included differences between treatment groups in daily capillary blood glucose concentrations, the occurrence of mild or severe hypoglycemia (&lt;70 mg/dl and &lt;40 mg/dl, respectively, 15), the length of hospital stay and the occurrence of any of the following post-surgery complications: the occurrence in temperature ≥38.5 °C at least 3 days after surgery [16] associated with increase in WBC ≥ 10.0 × 103/mm3[17] and CRP ≥114 mg/l [18] six days after surgery as indirect index of infection complication, stroke, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, heart failure, low cardiac output syndrome, acute fibrillation, anemia or exitus.Statistical methodsContinuous variables were expressed as the mean ± SD median and were compared using the unpaired t-test. Categorical variables were expressed as number with percentage and were compared using the Chi-Square test. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of group 1, with patients of group 2 as a reference. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).Calculation of the sample sizeThe calculation of the sample size was calculated analyzing previous studies in which 7.1% of subjects submitted to basal insulin (either as CIII or sc therapy), and 23.7% of subjects treated with sliding scale regular insulin sc therapy, showed infective complications after cardio or general surgery [15], [19], [20]. In the present study, we aimed to detect a minimal difference of 50% in the primary outcome between treatments with a 2-sided type error protection of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Therefore, we estimated that the required sample size was at least 115 subjects for each group; we optimized the power of the study with a ratio of 1:6.Ethics statementThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of IRCCS San Raffaele Institute, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.ResultsEvaluation of clinical outcomesAs shown in , the composite of postoperative infective complications was found in 2.48% and in 7.96% of the patients in group 1 and in group 2, respectively (p &lt; 0.049). The risk of presenting with these complications was reduced by almost 70% in group 1 compared with group 2, with an odds ratio of 0.294 (95% CI; 0.111–0.780). The most common organisms identified in the bloodstream infection cultures were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, psedomonas, Escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis. In confirmation of this result, the risk of presenting with temperature ≥38.5 °C at least 3 days after surgery associated with increase in WBC ≥ 10.0 × 103/mm3 and CRP ≥ 114 mg/l six days after surgery was decreased by 70% (1.65% vs 5.21%) in group 1 compared to group 2, with an odds ratio of 0.306 (95% CI; 0.094–0.999).Table 3Composite hospital complications and outcomes.All (%)Group 1 (%)Group 2 (%)P valueOdd Ratio (IC 95%)PostoperativeInfection complications58 (7.14)3 (2.48)55 (7.96)0.0490.294 (0.110–0780)Wound infection10 (1.23)1 (0.83)9 (1.30)Mediastinitis5 (0.62)0 (0.00)5 (0.72)Endocarditis3 (0.37)0 (0.00)3 (0.43)Cardiac device infection2 (0.25)0 (0.00)2 (0.29)Pneumonia9 (1.11)0 (0.00)9 (1.30)bloodstream infection29 (3.57)2 (1.65)27 (3.91)Temperature ≥ 38.5 °C + WBC ≥ 10.0x103/mm3 + CRP ≥ 114 mg/dl*38 (4.68)2 (1.65)36 (5.21)0.140.306 (0.094–0.999)Acute atrial fibrillation237 (29.19)42 (34.71)195 (28.22)0.181.350 (0.989–1.848)Low cardiac output syndrome140 (17.24)17 (14.05)123 (17.80)0.380.755 (0.478–1.191)Pericardial effusion52 (6.40)4 (3.31)48 (6.95)0.190.458 (1.188–1.116)Stroke5 (0.62)1 (0.83)4 (0.58)0.750.431 (0.191–10.743)Myocardial infarction4 (0.49)1 (0.83)3 (0.43)0.891.912 (0.363–10.050)Anemization201 (24.75)28 (23.14)173 (25.04)0.220.742 (0.504–1.093)Acute respiratory failure113 (13.92)19 (15.70)94 (13.60)0.631.183 (0.756–1.850)Heart failure163 (20.03)17 (14.05)146 (21.13)0.090.610 (0.383–0.971)Acute kidney failure133 (16.38)22 (18.18)111 (16.06)0.651.161 (0.758–1.780)Mortality**9 (1.11)1 (0.82)8 (1.16)0.43Mild hypoglycemia (&lt;70 mg/dl)46 (5.67)18 (14.88)28 (4.05)0.00014.140 (2.626–6.522)Severe hypoglycemia (&lt;40 mg/dl)5 (0.61)1 (0.83)4 (0.58)0.751.430 (0.272–7.526)Length of stay (days)8.54 ± 8.627.21 ± 5.088.76 ± 9.080.007No significant differences were found when evaluating the other secondary outcomes in the two groups, except for the length of hospital stay and the presence of mild hypoglycemic episodes. The mean length of hospital stay was 18% lower in group 1 than in group 2 (7.21 ± 05.08 vs 8.76 ± 9.08 days, p &lt; 0.007) despite the risk of presenting with mild hypoglycemia being increased by almost four times in group 1 compared with group 2 (odds ratio 4.140, 95% CI; 2.626–6.522) However, no differences were found in evaluating the risk for severe hypoglycemic episodes between the two groups (odd ratio 1.430; 95% CI; 0.272–7.526).Inflammatory markers during the perioperative periodBefore the surgery, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) levels were 6.19 ± 14.86 mg/l and 6.85 ± 2.10 × 103/mm3 in group 1 and 5.38 ± 10.68 mg/l and 6.75 ± 1.91 × 103/mm3 in group 2 (N.S.).After surgery, CRP and WBC increased, with the highest levels being at day 2, after which the levels decreased but remained higher than baseline levels in both groups (). Conversely, CRP and WBC levels were lower in group 1 than in group 2 from day 2 to the day of discharge (, p &lt; 0.05 two days and six days after surgery and discharge for both).Table 4Inflammatory marker profiles during the perioperative periodGroup 1Group 2P valueC Protein Reactive (mg/l)Before the surgery6.19 ± 14.865.38 ± 10.680.572 days after surgery178.18 ± 73.49193.05 ± 76.03&lt;0.054 days after surgery146.70 ± 79.43156.38 ± 125.200.416 days after surgery95.40 ± 59.44111.23 ± 73.55&lt;0.05Discharge81.34 ± 56.0294.39 ± 67.25&lt;0.05White Blood Cells (103/mm3)Before the surgery6.85 ± 2.106.75 ± 1.910.622 days after surgery14.97 ± 6.0116.40 ± 5.80&lt;0.054 days after surgery9.80 ± 3.089.90 ± 3.620.756 days after surgery8.97 ± 3.249.71 ± 3.99&lt;0.05Discharge8.87 ± 2.789.52 ± 5.07&lt;0.05Glucose levels and insulin requirement during the during the perioperative period ()Glucose levels and insulin therapy during the perioperative period. Glucose levels (A) were significantly higher in group 1 (basal + pre-meal insulin therapy, black lines and squares) than in group 2 (pre-meal insulin therapy, black lines and white diamonds) from immediately after surgery until day 2 post-surgery. Rapid insulin administration (B) during the surgery and on day 1 after the surgery, was performed intravenously (U/kg/hr) in the intensive care unit, with the amount being significantly higher in group 1 (black histograms) than in group 2 (white histograms). From day two after surgery to discharge, rapid insulin was administered subcutaneously (U/kg) and the amount was similar in both groups. Rapid insulin in the ICU was regular insulin while in the cardio-surgery ward was aspart insulin. Basal insulin administration (C, black histograms) started from day 2 after surgery until discharge in group 1. Basal insulin in the cardio surgery ward was isophane, i.e., protophane every 12 h, in 69 patients, detemir every 12 h in 50 patients and glargine every 24 h in 2 patients. (*): p &lt; 0.05 group 1 vs group 2. (**): p &lt; 0.01 group 1 vs group 2.Surgery period Before surgery, glucose levels were 100.1 ± 22.1 and 100.3 ± 23.8 mg/dl in group 1 and group 2, respectively (N.S.). The mean glucose levels during surgery were 137.9 ± 41.5 and 116.0 ± 27.9 mg/dl, respectively (p &lt; 0.01) despite the CIII being significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (0.10 ± 0.11 vs 0.04 ± 0.03 U/kg/h, p &lt; 0.01).Cardiovascular intensive care unit period During this period (from immediately after surgery until day 1 post-surgery), glucose levels remained significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (maximum glucose level: 179.8 ± 25.3 vs 169.5 ± 10.6 mg/dl, respectively, p &lt; 0.01) despite the CIII remaining significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (0.046 ± 0.008 vs 0.037 ± 0.015 U/kg/h, p &lt; 0.05).Cardiac surgery division period Glucose levels were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 only during day 2 post-surgery: (capillary fasting glucose: 170.4 ± 43.7 vs 120.4 ± 13.9 mg/dl; p &lt; 0.001, respectively) while from day 3 to the day of discharge glucose levels were almost normalized either at fasting or postprandially in both groups (). During this period, the amount of premeal insulin was similar in both groups, ranging between 0.21 ± 0.18 and 0.34 ± 0.35 U/kg/day in group 1 and between 0.18 ± 0.14 and 0.34 ± 0.37 U/kg/day in group 2 (). Basal insulin therapy, administered only in group 1, ranged between 0.26 ± 0.18 and 0.35 ± 0.20 U/kg/day.During the stay in the cardiovascular intensive care unit and in the cardiac surgery division, there were 18 and 28 episodes of mild hypoglycemia (glucose levels &lt;70 mg/dl) in group 1 and 2, respectively, (p &lt; 0.0001) while there was only 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia (glucose levels &lt;40 mg/dl) in group 1 and 4 episodes of severe hypoglycemia in group 2 (p = 0.75). In the present study we reported the total number of hypoglycemic episodes and not the number of patients that showed hypoglycemic episodes. This implies that there may have been more patients who experienced more than one episode of hypoglycemia.DiscussionBasal insulin therapy and postoperative infective complicationsThis study was designed to evaluate whether a constant increase in circulating insulin levels due to a basal insulin administration per se, independent of glycemic levels, could influence the composite of postoperative infective complications [14] after cardiac surgery. We found that these complications after cardiac surgery were significantly decreased by the constant increase of circulating insulin levels (basal + premeal insulin therapy) compared with an intermittent insulin increase (premeal insulin alone therapy).). In fact, the risk of presenting with these composite infective complications was reduced by almost 70% in group 1 compared with group 2 with an odds ratio of 0.294 (95% CI; 0.110–0.780), although glycemic levels were significantly increased in the former group of patients during surgery and in the two days after surgery. It is also important to note that in both groups of patients, glucose levels were always below 180 mg/dl as suggested by the local and international guidelines [9]. In group 1, to achieve a rapid steady state, basal insulin was administered twice a day with isophane insulin (protophane insulin) or detemir insulin with a therapeutic goal obtained 24 h later. Conversely, as the biological half-life of insulin aspart is only 2–4 h, this therapy was unable to ensure an adequate constant increase of basal insulin levels when administered premeal three times a day.Previous studies have demonstrated that continuous insulin, either CIII or sc therapy, improves daily glucose profiles and composite hospital infective complications compared with sliding scale regular insulin therapy [15], [20].Insulin effects on immune cellsInsulin exerts its effects on immune cells by binding to the insulin receptor, which is extensively expressed on immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, determines regulatory properties of insulin, both for the antimicrobial and for the inflammatory response in infection [21], [22], [23]. In fact, the presence of insulin resistance, with decreased insulin action is associated with increased susceptibility to invasive bacterial infections [9], [10], [24], [25]. An immuno-modulatory effect of insulin has been experimentally demonstrated in a mouse model [26]. Moreover, Kenzel et al., [27] found in vitro that insulin specifically inhibited the chemokine response to Group B Streptococcus and other bacteria by modulating NF-kB binding to chemokine genes via activation of PI3 K. Insulin concentrations in several tissues are higher than in plasma [10]. Therefore, it is conceivable that high tissue insulin concentrations achieved by a constant increase in circulating insulin levels due to basal + premeal insulin therapy instead of premeal insulin alone therapy may interfere with polymorphonuclear leukocytes recruitment and affect tissue homeostasis [27]. The evaluation of CRP and WBC levels after surgery in the present study are in agreement with these insulin-induced molecular mechanisms () .Insulin therapy and hypoglycemiaThe basal + premeal insulin therapy is well tolerated with an acceptable rate of hypoglycemia. In this study, a glucose level &lt;70 mg/dl was reported in 14.88% of patients in the basal + premeal insulin group and in 4.05% in the premeal insulin alone therapy group (p &lt; 0.0001), without significant differences in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia. Similar results were reported during the Umpierrez et al. study[15], in which glucose levels &lt;70 mg/dl were reported in 23.1% of patients in the basal-bolus and in 4.7% in the sliding scale regular insulin therapy group without differences in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia. On the other hand, mild hypoglycemic episodes in the present study were 36% and 38% lower than those find in the Umpierrez at al [15] and in Bellido et al. [28] studies, respectively, underlying the importance of a strict collaboration between surgery and diabetologist teams.It is interesting to note that in both the Umpierrez et al. [15]. and in our study, the length of hospital stay was significantly decreased with basal + premeal insulin therapy. Moreover, in the present study, the length of hospital stay after surgery was 1.5 days less (decrease of 18%) than with premeal insulin alone therapy, providing a significant impact on public health costs. In agreement with these data, Greco et al. [29] found in a multicenter cohort study in 4316 cardiac surgery patients operated in 2010, although the presence of hyperglycemia (≥180 mg/dl) was associated with an additional cost of $3192, an additional length of hospital stay of 0.8 days and an increase in infections of 1.6%, this effect was counter-regulated by the insulin treatment in the presence of the same hyperglycemic levels (180 to 240 mg/dl). In fact, in these insulin-treated patients there was a cost reductions of $6225, a reduction of length of hospital stay of 1.6 days and a reduction of infections of 4.1%.Limitations/StrengthsThis study was limited by being a single-center retrospective observational nature and by the evaluation of an association between the use of basal insulin therapy and an improvement in postoperative infective complications. On the other hand, the strength of our study was to exclude patients with a clinically relevant history of hyperglycemic crises before admission. In fact, it is well known that diabetic subjects with higher HbA1c could have increased risk to develop postoperative infective complications and the intensive insulin therapy during the post surgery period reduced these risks. These data were elegantly presented by ref 6 e ref 30 et al. and this argument would also beyond the scope of the study. Therefore, we only studied individuals who needed insulin therapy from the onset of elevated blood glucose levels during cardiac surgery. Thus, we were able to evaluate the effect of basal insulin per se on postoperative infective complications and could exclude a possible legacy hyperglycemic effect on post-surgery outcomes [6], [30]. This exclusion criterion might explain the almost normal HbA1c levels before surgery in both groups of subjects. In a previous study we found that in subjects submitted to cardiac surgery, before the surgery intervention the presence of impaired glucose tolerance or new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was present in 56% of subjects affected by mitral or aortic valve disease and in 67% of subjects affected by ischemic cardiac disease [31]. This data are in agreement with previous epidemiological studies on patients affected by valve disease in which the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was at least doubled as compared to the general population aged between 20 and 79 years (10.9% vs. 5.5% in Canada and 13.4% vs. 7.9% in USA) [32], [33], [34] and with our previous studies on non-diabetic subjects affected by ischemic heart disease undergoing coronary stenting [35]. This high percentage of alterations in glucose metabolism in these subjects well explains how we selected almost 50% of subject hospitalized during this period and underlines the potential clinical relevance of the study. On the other hands, it is important to underline that nearly 90% of the patients in the study did not have diabetes and this should impact interpretation and application of the results. For instance data from the gLUCO-CABG study indicates that patients without DM may do better at lower BG targets than patients with DM [36].ConclusionIn conclusion, the basal + premeal insulin regimen is associated with a reduced frequency of postoperative infective complications than the premeal insulin alone therapy, without increasing the number of severe hypoglycemic events. Therefore, these results suggest, for the first time, a beneficial effect of basal insulin therapy on post-surgery outcome independent of circulating glucose levels. Moreover, the present study suggests that the basal + premeal insulin regimen could be preferred over pre-meal insulin alone treatment in cardiac surgery patients requiring continuous intravenous insulin infusion for an acute increase in circulating glucose levels during the cardiac surgery period. However, although the present study included a relatively large number of subjects, a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial on the effect of insulin per se, independent of glycemic control, on composite hospital infective complications in cardiac surgery setting is certainly needed.FundingsNo funding was obtained.Disclosure statementsThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Author contributionsPMP and LDM share equal contribution in the design of the study.

"Bariatric surgery as a model to explore the basis and consequences of the Reaven hypothesis: Small, dense low-density lipoprotein and interleukin-6","IntroductionThe advent of reliable plasma insulin assays in the 1960s provided the opportunity for Gerald Reaven et al.1 to discover the association between the insulin response to carbohydrate feeding and serum triglyceride levels. Higher insulin responses were associated with higher triglyceride levels.1 Reaven and others went on to report that a constellation of other abnormalities was also associated with an exaggerated insulin response in addition to hypertriglyceridaemia, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or a predisposition to it, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, hypertension, hyperuricaemia and raised plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), fibrinogen and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).2–5 This, he termed 'Syndrome X',2 although it is now more widely known as the metabolic syndrome, particularly when associated with obesity. Initially, Reaven's hypothesis stated that increased insulin levels were the cause of the hypertriglyceridaemia, because insulin was at that time believed to stimulate hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion.1 However, later experiments with adult hepatocytes maintained in tissue culture showed that the primary effect of insulin on hepatic VLDL secretion was inhibitory.6–8 Thus, the hypertriglyceridaemia was due to insulin resistance, rather than hyperinsulinaemia, as previously proposed by Himsworth9 many years previously. Reaven thus modified his hypothesis and extended it to state that both muscle and the liver must be resistant to the action of insulin, at least in relation to their diminished capacity for the uptake of glucose, and therefore, the increased insulin levels were a response to overcome the insulin resistance. That hepatic insulin resistance could also explain the hypertriglyceridaemia of metabolic syndrome and T2DM, was later confirmed in human studies of VLDL kinetics.10–12 Throughout his life Reaven continued to argue, however, that it was impossible using available techniques and models to separate the effects of insulin resistance from the effects of too much insulin in humans.13 It is known that insulin resistance due to inherited insulin receptor defects results in reduced glucose uptake and hyperinsulinaemia, but does not lead to hypertriglyceridaemia or hepatic steatosis.14 However, after its uptake by functioning receptors, insulin regulates multiple intracellular pathways through several signalling mechanisms.15 It therefore remains entirely possible that some of these are resistant to insulin, whereas, as Reaven originally postulated, others are over-stimulated by the hyperinsulinaemia which develops to maintain euglycaemia. When the increased delivery of insulin is inadequate to overcome insulin resistance to glucose uptake, T2DM develops, but the insulin levels are much higher than in healthy, non-obese, people without diabetes.16The provision of evidence that hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance is causal for hypertriglyceridaemia and the other components of the metabolic syndrome was, until the advent of bariatric surgery, hampered by the lack of a means of dramatically reversing it. Drugs which decrease insulin resistance tend to have multiple other actions and the effect of weight reduction through dietary restriction can only be studied when a large proportion of failures are excluded. Bariatric surgery provides a means of substantially and consistently reversing hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance. While the substantial decrease in adiposity may explain this reversal of hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance, additional mechanisms such as changes in gut hormone profiles due to intestinal bypass may contribute. We, and others, have previously reported a decrease in elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and an increase in adiponectin after bariatric surgery.17–20 These cytokines emanate from adipose tissue and those from visceral adipose tissue, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), arrive at the liver via the portal circulation,21 and are believed to be responsible for hepatic resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake.22Quite why the metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) has never been fully explained. Increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and in its major protein moiety, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), which are definitely causal, are not a feature of metabolic syndrome.2,23 Moderate hypertriglyceridaemia, typical of the metabolic syndrome has proved controversial as a cause of CVD,24 and the role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in atherogenesis is currently being re-evaluated.25 We have previously made a preliminary report of a decrease in small, dense low-density lipoprotein (SD-LDL) following bariatric surgery.18 SD-LDL is increased in hypertriglyceridaemia 26–28 and is particularly susceptible to atherogenic modifications, such as oxidation and glycation.29,30 Inflammatory cytokines associated with atherothrombosis may also make a major contribution to CVD in metabolic syndrome.31 In the present study, we have undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the effect of bariatric surgery on insulin secretion and insulin resistance in relation to the change in SD-LDL and IL-6, an upstream regulator of C-reactive protein (CRP),4 as there is emerging evidence from Mendelian randomisation studies that it has a longer term association with CVD than hs-CRP.32,33 We have sought to establish the basis for the change in insulin secretion and insulin resistance after bariatric surgery, to further understand the basis of the Reaven hypothesis.MethodsStudy design and patient recruitmentThis study was a prospective observational cohort study. Forty patients (8 men and 32 women) with obesity were recruited from the pre-bariatric surgery clinic at Salford Royal Hospital, a Tier 4 specialist weight management service in the North West of England. They all underwent Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.Prior ethical approval was sought and granted by the Central Manchester Research and Ethics Committee. All patients were given detailed information about the study and each person provided informed consent before taking part in the study.Patient assessmentsPatients were asked to attend a morning appointment (between 09:00 and 10:30 h) having fasted from 22:00 h at baseline and then 6 and 12 months after bariatric surgery. At each visit, a detailed medical history including medication used was assessed. Each participant underwent measurement of their weight and height and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Blood pressure was measured after resting in a seated position for 15 min, using an Omron HEM 705-CP semiautomatic oscillometric recorder. Fasting venous blood was collected at each visit. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the current revision from the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III.23Complete remission from type 2 diabetes was determined 12 months post-operatively with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) below 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) and no active pharmacological therapy, as per the American Diabetes Association consensus statement.34Laboratory procedures and analysesHbA1c and fasting glucose were assessed in the biochemistry laboratory at Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust using routine methods. The remaining samples were processed in the Cardiovascular Research Lab at the University of Manchester. Laboratory procedures and measurements were carried out according to our previously described protocol.18 Serum and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma were isolated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4°C within 2 h of blood collection. Aliquots for biochemical analysis were frozen at −80°C.Total cholesterol was measured using the cholesterol oxidase phenol 4-aminoantipyrine peroxidase method and triglycerides by the glycerol phosphate oxidase phenol 4-aminoantipyrine peroxidase method. HDL-C was measured using a second-generation homogeneous direct method (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK). LDL-C was estimated using the Friedewald formula.35 ApoB was measured using immunoturbidimetric assays (ABX Diagnostics, Shefford, UK). All these tests were performed on a Cobas Mira analyser (Horiba ABX Diagnostics, Nottingham, UK).Small, dense low-density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B (SD-LDL ApoB; LDL particles of density &gt; 1.044 g/mL) was isolated from plasma and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 r/min (435,680 × g) for 5 h at 4°C using a Beckman Optima TLX bench top ultracentrifuge fitted with TLA 120.2 fixed angle rotor (Beckman Coulter UK).36 ApoB in SD-LDL was then determined using an immunoturbidimetric assay (ABX Diagnostics). SD-LDL is thus expressed in terms of the plasma concentration of its ApoB component.An in-house, antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using anti-human CRP antibody, calibrators and controls from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) was used to measure hs-CRP. IL-6 was measured by ELISA using kits from R&amp;D Systems (Abingdon, UK). The upper limit (95th percentile) for IL-6 in plasma was 3.1 pg/mL.37 Plasma insulin was measured with Mercodia ELISA kits from Diagenics Ltd. (Milton Keynes, UK). Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess insulin resistance,38 using the formulaHOMA-IR=[insulin(mU/L)×glucose(mmol/L)]/22.5The laboratories participated in the UK National External Quality Assessment Service (UKNEQAS, Birmingham, UK) for quality control of general blood chemistry.Statistical analysisSPSS for Mac (Version 23.0; IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and GraphPad Prism (Version 7.00; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) were used for analysis of data. Tests for normality were done using the Shapiro–Wilk test, visualisation of histograms and Q-Q plots. When more than two time points were being compared, one-way ANOVA was used for parametric data and Friedman's two-way analysis of variance by Ranks was used for non-parametric data. Specific post hoc pairwise comparisons were done using the Bonferroni correction in SPSS. The McNemar test was used to compare paired categorical variables. The percentage change in variables was determined as the absolute difference between measurements 12 months after surgery and baseline divided by the baseline value (and multiplied by 100). Correlation analysis was done using Pearson's test for parametric and Spearman's test for non-parametric data. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.DiscussionThis study shows that a marked reduction in hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance in obese people after bariatric surgery ameliorates not only raised triglycerides, hs-CRP and low HDL-C, features of the Reaven syndrome,2 but also SD-LDL and IL-6, irrespective of the presence of T2DM or statin therapy.SD-LDL concentration increases with triglyceride levels.26 It is a cholesterol-depleted low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the presence of which is not evident from measurement of LDL-C. It contributes to total serum ApoB and is the cause of hyperapobetalipoproteinaemia,39 but the majority of ApoB-containing lipoproteins are of lower density so that even when total ApoB is measured its presence may not be obvious. It is likely that it is the cause of the association between hypertriglyceridaemia and CVD.24,26,27 SD-LDL is more susceptible both to oxidative and glycative modification than less dense LDL species.29,30 Both oxidatively modified and glycated LDL, unlike more buoyant, unmodified LDL, are rapidly taken up via scavenger receptors on macrophages in tissue culture to become foam cells similar to those in atheromatous lesions.40 In our series of patients, the SD-LDL concentration of 22.1 mg/dL at baseline declined to 10.2 mg/dL 12 months after bariatric surgery, restoring its levels close to the median value in a healthy population (14 mg/dL for men and 9 mg/dL for women).41A raised level of hs-CRP is recognised as a feature of metabolic syndrome2 and is closely associated to the risk of developing CVD.4 However, evidence that hs-CRP is causally related to CVD has not been forthcoming.4 On the other hand IL-6, a major regulator of hepatic CRP secretion, unlike CRP, has been found in Mendelian randomisation studies to be linked to atherosclerosis.4,32,33 Many adipokines are released both from peripheral and visceral adipose tissue, which have the potential to contribute to hepatic insulin resistance and secretion of CRP, but those released from visceral fat may have a special place in the genesis of the metabolic syndrome, because they arrive at the liver through the portal vein and may do so at higher concentration than those arriving by the hepatic artery after dilution in the systemic circulation. IL-6 was found in much higher concentration in portal blood than in systemic arterial blood by Fontana et al.21 in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery for obesity. Tumour necrosis factor-α, resistin, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 and adiponectin concentrations were similar in the portal vein and radial artery. Portal vein IL-6 concentration also correlated directly with systemic CRP. The decrease in IL-6 after bariatric surgery, suggests that it could be associated with the decrease in hs-CRP and other features of hepatic insulin resistance. Recently, reduction in IL-6 levels similar to that reported here, but achieved by administration of a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-1β, was reported to be associated with decreased atherosclerotic CVD incidence.31The findings of this and earlier reports in which the effects of the decrease in insulin resistance accompanying weight loss on components of the metabolic syndrome have been investigated,17–20 provide powerful support for Reaven's hypothesis. Bariatric surgery which induces the most dramatic decreases in hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance is a model which could yield an even greater understanding of, for example, the mechanism by which atheroma risk is increased. Our finding of a decrease in SD-LDL should lead to exploration of the effects of weight loss due to bariatric surgery on modified, potentially highly atherogenic LDL subspecies, such as oxidised and glycated LDL. Furthermore, it could lead to some resolution of the conflict which exists between which components of the metabolic (Reaven) syndrome are due to resistance to insulin (too little insulin action) and which are due to hyperinsulinaemia itself (too much insulin action). In recent years, it has often been forgotten that, because insulin regulates several intracellular signalling pathways controlling a variety of processes, while its effects will be deficient in pathways resistant to it, in others the high levels of insulin produced to attempt to maintain euglycaemia may hyperstimulate non-resistant pathways. An example might be the regulation of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG), which is decreased in insulin resistance, leading to increased free androgen levels in both men and women.42,43 This at least partly explains the androgenisation of insulin resistant women and thus their male pattern (visceral; central) obesity and hirsutism. Despite the association of insulin resistance with decreased SHBG, however, tissue culture experiments with human hepatocytes reveal insulin to have an inhibitory action on SHBG production.44,45 Thus, unlike the VLDL production pathway where insulin resistance decreases the inhibitory effect of insulin despite the increase in its concentration in response to resistance to glucose uptake, the pathway for the production of SHBG must escape resistance to the action of insulin and be inhibited by hyperinsulinaemia. The model of bariatric surgery may provide opportunities for futher study of this mechanism as it may for other phenomena associated with the hyperinsulinaemia of insulin resistance, such as the pathways linking metabolic syndrome to hyperuricaemia.46It has been difficult to distinguish components of the metabolic syndrome due to resistance to insulin action and those hyperstimulated by the ensuing increase in insulin secretion to maintain euglycaemia as first discussed in Kim and Reaven.13 We found that the strength of the associations between change in components of the metabolic syndrome, such as triglycerides and HDL-C, and change in fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were similar with perhaps the suggestion that triglyceride concentration was more closely related to insulin resistance and HDL-C to fasting insulin levels. It has been suggested that the insulin clamp technique would be a better means of assessing insulin resistance rather than HOMA-IR, which relies on the ratio between fasting insulin and glucose.38 However, this argument is less persuasive when it is considered that in insulin clamping, the insulin is administered into the systemic rather than the portal circulation into which it is secreted physiologically.47 This means that physiologically the liver is subject to much higher levels than peripheral tissues and the insulin clamp is thus measuring insulin resistance to glucose uptake in tissues, such as skeletal muscle, while hepatic uptake is relatively unaffected by insulin arriving by the hepatic artery. Presumably, HOMA-IR, however, represents the contribution of both hepatic and peripheral glucose disposal. At the time of bariatric surgery, direct measurement of hormones and metabolites in portal venous blood can be undertaken,21 but repetition of this after weight loss is not possible, at least in human models. Nonetheless, discovering which processes are resistant to insulin and which are over-stimulated by the accompanying hyperinsulinaemia could be important therapeutically.We conclude that bariatric surgery provides an excellent model to dissect Reaven's hypothesis, to discover the mechanisms by which its components, such as raised SD-LDL and IL-6, cause atherosclerosis. It also raises questions about the respective roles of insulin resistance and of hyperinsulinaemia on different components of the metabolic syndrome.1.Reaven, GM, Lerner, RL, Stern, MP.

Eighty patients with metabolic syndrome treated in Linyi Central Hospital from January 2017 to December 2017 were selected and divided into control group (n=40) and observation group (n=40). Patients in control group were treated with regular therapy using the Western medicine and drugs, while those in observation group, based on the treatment in control group, were treated with berberine. Changes in relevant indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups. The correlation of inflammatory factor with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, triglyceride and total cholesterol was analyzed. At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance index and blood lipid indexes in both groups were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05). At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance index and blood lipid indexes in observation group were significantly lower than those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in both groups at 1 month after treatment were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05), and they were lower in observation group at 1 month after treatment than those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05). Finally, hs-CRP was positively correlated with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride. The combined application of berberine in patients with metabolic syndrome can effectively regulate blood glucose and blood lipid of patients, alleviate insulin resistance and reduce the level of inflammatory response in the body.Keywords: berberine, metabolic syndrome, blood glucose metabolism, blood lipid metabolism, inflammatory factors, insulin resistanceIntroductionMetabolic syndrome mainly refers to a group of pathophysiological changes based on insulin resistance (1), the major clinical manifestations are central obesity, increase in blood glucose, increase in blood lipid and increase in blood pressure, seriously affecting the physical health of patients. The above clinical manifestations of metabolic syndrome, as a metabolic dysfunction-related disease (2), have certain common risk factors, which are in line with the 'concept of holism, homotherapy for heteropathy' in the traditional Chinese medicine. It is of important significance to effectively intervene in patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, and endocrine diseases (like type 2 diabetes mellitus) (3), alleviate or avoid the occurrence of insulin resistance and make full use of the concept of 'preventive treatment of disease', namely 'prevention before disease onset, prevention of disease from exacerbating', in the traditional Chinese medicine, thereby increasing the therapeutic effect on metabolic syndrome and improving the prognosis of patients (4).Berberine, also known as Berberine hydrochloride in clinic, is the isoquinoline alkaloid, an active ingredient extracted from Chinese herbal medicines, such as Coptis chinensis and Phellodendron amurense, which has dominant advantages such as reducing blood glucose, and regulating blood lipid and vascular endothelial cells (5). In recent years, berberine has been widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia (6). With the deepening of fundamental research on berberine, it has been confirmed that the main mechanisms of berberine in reducing blood glucose and blood pressure and regulating blood lipid are promotion of insulin secretion and improvement of the body's insulin resistance (7). To better investigate the clinical value of berberine in the treatment of metabolic syndrome, this study was performed from the perspectives of blood glucose, blood lipid, insulin resistance and inflammatory factor levels.Patients and methodsPatient data A total of 80 patients with metabolic syndrome treated in Linyi Central Hospital (Linyi, China) from January 2017 to December 2017 were selected. All patients met the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese Medical Association (8) for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Before enrollment, patients signed an informed consent, and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Linyi Central Hospital. Patients enrolled were aged 60–80 years, and they were physically healthy in the past. Exclusion criteria: i) Patients complicated with other endocrine system diseases, mental diseases, malignant tumor or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ii) patients who were illiterate, allergic to drugs applied or could not pay the medical expenses. Patients were divided into two groups with 40 cases in each group using the random number method. There were no statistically significant differences in comparisons of general data and related indexes between the two groups (P&gt;0.05) ().Table I.Comparison of general data and related indexes between the two groups (mean ± SD).GroupSex (male/female)Age (years)Fasting blood glucose (mmol/l)2 h postprandial blood glucose (mmol/l)Insulin resistanceObservation group20/2065.6±1.810.5±0.613.5±1.31.5±0.1Control group20/2065.5±1.810.6±0.613.6±1.31.5±0.1χ2 or t value&lt;0.0010.2480.7450.344&lt;0.001P-value&gt;0.050.8040.4580.732&gt;0.05ContinuedGroupTriglyceride (mmol/l)Total cholesterol (mmol/l)Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (ng/l)Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (ng/l)High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (ml/l)Observation group2.53±0.136.11±0.090.69±0.05253.1±2.125.6±1.3Control group2.55±0.136.12±0.100.70±0.05253.6±2.025.7±1.4χ2 or t value0.6880.4700.8941.0900.331P-value0.4930.6400.3740.2790.742Methods Patients in control group were treated with regular therapy using the Western medicine and drugs strictly in accordance with the treatment guidelines of metabolic syndrome of the Chinese Medical Association. First of all, the weight of patients was reduced, the diet adjustment was strengthened, and the body mass index ≤28. Patients exercised properly according to the body's tolerance, and it was recommended that they take part in light-moderate physical activity every day for half an hour. In addition, the insulin resistance was reduced, in other words, the blood glucose-regulating drugs, such as metformin and insulin sensitizing drug thiazolidinedione, were applied while diet and exercise interventions were performed. At the same time, the intervention in hyperlipidemia was also performed, and it was advised that fibrates and statins be applied. Finally, the patient's blood pressure was adjusted and controlled within 130/80 mmHg. In terms of antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) were preferred choices. Patients in observation group, based on the treatment in control group, were treated with berberine (Jiangxi Sinopharm Co., Ltd., Jiangxi, China, NMPN Z36020766) 3 times a day (4 tablets/time).Observation indexes All patients were followed up for 1 month. Changes in relevant indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment. The correlations of inflammatory factor hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, triglyceride and total cholesterol were analyzed.Evaluation criteria Related detection indexes to blood glucose included fasting blood glucose (3.9–6.1 mmol/l), 2 h postprandial blood glucose (≤7.8 mmol/l) and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [reference value: 1, calculation formula: fasting blood glucose (mmol/l) × fasting insulin (mU/l)]. Related indexes to blood lipid included triglyceride (0.56–1.71 mmol/l) and total cholesterol (2.83–5.17 mmol/l). Inflammation-related factors included hs-CRP (&lt;10 ml/l), IL-6 (0.37–0.46 ng/l) and TNF-α (5–100 ng/l).Statistical analysis SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Measurement data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (mean ±SD). Student's t-test was used for the comparison of related indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms between the two groups at different observation points, the Chi-square test (χ2) was used for the comparison of adverse reactions between the two groups, and correlations of hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride were analyzed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient method. The procedure was repeated 3 times. P&lt;0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsChanges in related indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose and insulin resistance index in both groups were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05), and levels of blood lipid indexes (triglyceride and total cholesterol) were also lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05). At 1 month after treatment, levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose and insulin resistance index in observation group were significantly decreased compared with those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05), and levels of blood lipid indexes (triglyceride and total cholesterol) were also lowered compared with those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05) ().Table II.Changes in related indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment (mean ± SD).GroupTreatmentFasting blood glucose (mmol/l)2 h postprandial blood glucose (mmol/l)Insulin resistanceTriglyceride (mmol/l)Total cholesterol (mmol/l)Observation group1 week after treatment7.9±0.39.9±0.51.3±0.12.12±0.085.39±0.151 month after treatment5.6±0.2a,b7.5±0.3a,b1.1±0.11a,b1.56±0.07a,b3.69±0.08a,bControl group1 week after treatment8.0±0.410.0±0.51.4±0.12.13±0.095.40±0.161 month after treatment6.5±0.3a8.5±0.61a1.3±0.11a1.96±0.061a5.23±0.101at140.34526.0328.94433.31862.129p1&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001t218.97412.1474.4729.9405.698p2&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001t315.7879.4288.94427.44076.055p3&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001Changes in inflammatory factors in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment Levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α in both groups at 1 month after treatment were lower than those at 1 week after treatment (P&lt;0.05), and they were lower in observation group at 1 month after treatment than those in control group during the same period (P&lt;0.05) ().Table III.Changes in inflammatory factors in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment (mean ± SD).GroupTreatmenths-CRP (ml/l)IL-6 (ng/l)TNF-α (ng/l)Observation group1 week after treatment12.3±0.50.59±0.06136.8±11.11 month after treatment8.5±0.3a,b0.43±0.04a,b83.2±7.6a,bControl group1 week after treatment14.6±0.60.68±0.06146.5±11.31 month after treatment11.6±0.4a0.51±0.05a108.9±8.3at141.21714.03325.199p1&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001t226.31213.76616.961p2&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001t339.2127.90214.443p3&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001Correlation analysis of inflammatory factor hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose There was a positive correlation between inflammatory factor hs-CRP and fasting blood glucose (r=0.9242, P&lt;0.05) ().Correlation analysis of inflammatory factor hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose.

Patients have symptoms including central obesity, atherosclerosis, rise of blood lipid, pathoglycemia and elevation of blood pressure, which may be accompanied by microalbuminuria, hyperuricemia and long-term rise of chronic inflammatory cytokines (10). Currently, most scholars consider that insulin resistance is the most crucial independent risk factor and central link that lead to metabolic syndrome (11). Treatment for metabolic syndrome is based on improvement of patients' way of life, regulation of eating habits, exercise training and loss of weight, combined with drug therapy of reducing blood lipid and regulating blood pressure and blood glucose (12). Berberine can regulate various metabolic disorders of metabolic syndrome, which has advantages of wide medicinal herbs resources, low price, smaller adverse reactions, and is also safe and convenient (13).In this study, patients with metabolic syndrome in control group were given regular Western medicine treatment strictly following guideline requirements, while those in observation group received berberine treatment on the basis of that in control group. By analyzing changes of related indexes to blood glucose and lipid metabolisms in the groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment, it was found that related indexes to blood glucose and lipid in both groups were improved at 1 month after treatment, but levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose and insulin resistance index in observation group were significantly lower than those in control group at 1 month after treatment, and levels of blood lipid indexes (triglyceride and total cholesterol) in observation group were lower than those in control group at 1 month after treatment, indicating that combined use of berberine can regulate blood glucose and blood lipid levels more effectively and lighten insulin resistance. By exploring changes in relevant indexes of inflammatory factors in both groups at 1 week and 1 month after treatment, it was found that hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α levels in both groups were also lower than those at 1 week after treatment, but hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α levels in observation group were all lower than those in control group at 1 month after treatment, indicating that combined use of berberine tablets is of important significance for reducing inflammatory reaction in patients with metabolic syndrome. From the correlation research on inflammatory response factor hs-CRP with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride, it was revealed that hs-CRP was positively related to fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride, which further indicates that there is chronic inflammatory response in the body of patients with metabolic syndrome and the severity degree of inflammatory response is related to blood glucose and blood lipid metabolism. Chronic inflammatory response may also lead to increase of insulin resistance in the body and further worsen the disease condition. Besides, combined use of berberine tablets did not increase the incidence of adverse reactions of treatment, so combined use of berberine tablets is of high safety.In this study, combined use of berberine could effectively improve activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) of islet cells, thus promoting activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) signal pathway (14) and active secretion of insulin in the body. Moreover, berberine can also stimulate free fatty acid to induce secretion of insulin (15). Berberine improves physiological stimulation of glucose via cascade reaction of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), thus inducing secretion of insulin in the body, reducing insulin resistance, and improving sensitivity of liver, muscle tissues and fat to insulin (16). Berberine can improve the activity and promote the proliferation of insulin β cells (17). Therefore, the combined use of berberine in observation group could better control fasting blood glucose and 2 h postprandial plasma glucose and reduce insulin resistance in the body. Berberine inhibits synthesis and secretion of proteolipid protein and activity of peroxisome by enhancing low density lipoprotein receptor level and promoting adenylate-phosphoric acid-activated protein kinase activity, thus regulating blood lipid and inhibiting proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes, so as to achieve the objective of reducing free fatty acid in serum (18,19). Consequently, triglyceride and total cholesterol decreased significantly after combined use of berberine in observation group. In addition, berberine can also evidently decrease levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines in the body (20), improve calcium overload and ischemia reperfusion injury and provide anti-oxidative capacity (21).In conclusion, combined use of berberine for patients with metabolic syndrome can effectively regulate blood glucose and lipid, lighten insulin resistance in the body and reduce inflammatory response level.FundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsCC wrote the manuscript and collected the general data.

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells,"IntroductionEditorial, see p 1951Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is characterized by valvular calcification, followed by aortic stenosis and subsequent heart failure.1,2 CAVD progression is accompanied by highly regulated biological changes, including fibrous thickening and osteogenic changes in the aortic valve,3–6 wherein inflammation is the initiating event.3,4,7 Although CAVD shares similar pathological features with atherosclerosis in terms of lipid deposition and inflammation,7 previous trials with cholesterol-lowering statin therapy failed to prevent CAVD progression.8,9 Recent investigations identified reciprocal interactions between valvular endothelial cells (VECs) and valvular interstitial cells (VICs), which are critical for osteogenic changes in aortic valve tissues.1,4,10,11 However, the molecular mechanisms or targets for nonsurgical treatments, to prevent or slow the progression of CAVD, remain elusive.12Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26)—a multifunctional enzyme—is found in the catalytically active soluble form in plasma and on the surface of most cell types.13,14 DPP-4 cleaves the N-terminal dipeptides (ie, proline or alanine residues) from its substrates. Because most DPP-4 substrates are incretin hormones, DPP-4 has become a major target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, the prescription of DPP-4-inhibitors, a new class of oral hypoglycemics, has markedly increased over the past few years.15,16 Nevertheless, DPP-4 has a wide range of biological functions and can bind with numerous peptides that serve as potential substrates for DPP-4. The nonglycemic actions of DPP-4 and its inhibitor, particularly in cardiovascular disease involving the myocardium or heart valves, have not been fully characterized, and further studies are required.In the present study, we assessed whether DPP-4 can serve as a molecular therapeutic target for aortic valve calcification. DPP-4 increases valvular calcification and promotes CAVD progression by limiting autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling by the enzymatic degradation of IGF-1 in human VICs and inducing the subsequent osteogenic transdifferentiation of these cells to calcifying cells. In particular, we aimed to demonstrate that the DPP-4–IGF-1 axis is an important mechanism to explain the reciprocal interactions between VECs and VICs, which play a critical role in valve homeostasis, and that this axis can be an effective therapeutic target for the prevention of CAVD progression.MethodsHuman SubjectsHuman aortic valve tissues were obtained from patients with CAVD who underwent aortic valve replacement (n=10) and from extracted recipient hearts for use as non-CAVD controls (n=8) (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Half of each sample specimen was used to prepare VECs and VICs or was immediately stored in RNAlater (Life Technologies), whereas the other half was fixed in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek). The Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) approved the study protocol for the collection of human samples (reference no. 2013-0442), and all patients provided written informed consent.Animal ExperimentsMiceAll animal experiments were performed according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Committee for the Use and Care of Laboratory animals. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient (eNOS−/−) mice with a C57BL/6 background were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Wild-type (WT) and eNOS−/− mice (8 weeks of age) were randomly assigned and administered saline or Sitagliptin (15 mg/kg/d, Selleckchem) orally for 12 weeks. Mice were maintained on a 12-hour light−dark cycle. Under anesthesia, the mice were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Mice were euthanized, and blood and aortic valve samples were collected for analysis. The hearts were dissected, fixed overnight, and paraffin embedded. Serial sections (5 μm) were cut from the entire aortic valve area.RabbitsTwenty-nine male New Zealand white rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) were used in this study. They were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the diet and were followed for 12 weeks: (1) rabbits fed normal chow (control group, n=5), (2) rabbits fed 0.5% cholesterol-enriched chow (Dytes Inc.) plus 25 000 IU/day vitamin D2 (Vit.D2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in drinking water (Chol+Vit.D2 group, n=9), and (3) rabbits fed high-cholesterol diet+vitamin D supplements and also administered Sitagliptin orally for 12 weeks (Sitagliptin group, n=15). Rabbits in the Sitagliptin group were again randomized according to the Sitagliptin dose: 4, 8, or 15 mg/kg/day. Blood samples were obtained by the marginal vein of the rabbit ear at baseline and every 3 weeks thereafter. After 12 weeks, the rabbits were euthanized, and blood and aortic valve tissue samples were collected for analysis.Statistical AnalysisAll quantitative experiments were performed in triplicate (at a minimum). Data are presented as means±standard deviation. The Osteosense imaging and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed by individuals blinded to the allocation during outcome assessment. In vitro data were normally distributed, with similar variances among the groups. Because of the small number of animals in each group and because some of the distributions were not normal in the animal study, a nonparametric analysis of variance was used to compare continuous variables among the groups. A 2-tailed Student's t test or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Wilcoxon's signed rank tests were used to assess statistical significance. Bonferroni correction was performed to adjust for the multiple comparisons. A value of P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.The Supplemental Methods section in the online-only Data Supplement provides a detailed description of the global gene expression analysis; cell culture; osteogenic differentiation; alkaline phosphatase, alizarin red, and Von Kossa staining; calcium assay; reporter assays; alkaline phosphatase activity assays; fluorescence reflectance imaging in vivo; immunohistochemistry; immunofluorescence staining; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; immunoblot assay; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; determination of DPP-4 activity; and echocardiography.ResultsDPP-4 Expression Is Upregulated in the Aortic Valves of Patients With CAVDTo determine the key factors for CAVD, we investigated the global gene expression profiles involved in human CAVD using Affymetrix Gene Chip microarrays. The genes associated with calcification, fibrosis, and inflammation were upregulated in the aortic valve tissue of patients with CAVD, compared with those of age-matched non-CAVD controls (Figure 1A). In particular, DPP-4 was significantly upregulated in patients with CAVD (Figure 1A and 1B). High DPP-4 protein expression was observed in the regions of the CAVD aortic valves with prominent calcified lesion formation, as demonstrated by alizarin red and Von Kossa staining, and was localized in VICs, as indicated by the coexpression of DPP-4 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of activated myofibroblast-like VICs (Figure 1C, 1D, 1E, and 1F). In contrast, the DPP-4 expression in non-CAVD human aortic valve tissue was negligible (Figure 1F).Figure 1. Upregulation of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) expression in human aortic valve tissue from a patient with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD).A, Gene expression profiles of calcification, fibrosis, and inflammation in aortic valve tissue. Up- and downregulated transcripts are shown in red and green, respectively. The columns correspond to aortic valve samples without (non-CAVD #1–3) and with (CAVD #1–3) CAVD. The heat map is scaled at the row level to compare expression profiles between samples for a given probe set. B, mRNA level of human DPP-4 (hDPP-4) was validated by performing quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in aortic valves from non-CAVD (n=8) and CAVD (n=10) samples. The expression values of the samples are shown relative to that of the GAPDH reference gene. Values represent fold changes of the mean value measured in the non-CAVD controls. C, Aortic valves from patients with CAVD and non-CAVD controls were stained with alizarin red (AR), Von Kossa (VK), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), hDPP-4, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining. Merged images (DAPI, hDPP-4, and α-SMA) are shown. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 100 μm. D, The bar graph presents the AR-positive area and (E) VK-positive area measured in each aortic valve from non-CAVD (n=8) and CAVD samples (n=10).

Only the human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs) expressing α-actin 2 and cardiac beta myosin heavy chain 7 in patients with CAVD exhibited a marked elevation of the osteogenic marker, alkaline phosphatase mRNA (Figure 2A), which coincided with an increase in both DPP-4 mRNA expression (Figure 2A) and DPP-4 protein level (Figure 2B). In contrast, human VECs expressing platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule showed minimal differences in the DPP-4 mRNA levels between patients with CAVD and non-CAVD controls (Figure 2A). The human VECs from CAVD aortic valves expressed lower levels of eNOS mRNA (Figure 2A) and protein (Figure I in the online-online Data Supplement), compared with those in the controls. These results suggest that prominent dysfunction in VECs and osteogenic changes in VICs are characteristic features of patients with CAVD.Figure 2.

A, Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of PECAM1 (platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1), ACTA2 (α-SMA) (alpha-actin 2), MYH7 (myosin heavy chain 7), ALP (alkaline phosphatase), human DPP-4 (hDPP-4), and human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (heNOS) from human valvular endothelial cells (hVECs) and human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs) in non-CAVD controls (n=8) and patients with CAVD (n=10). Values represent fold changes of the mean value measured in the non-CAVD hVEC group. B, The levels of hDPP-4 protein in conditioned media (CM) were measured in hVECs and hVICs of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. C, hDPP-4 mRNA levels in hVICs treated with Diethylenetriamine-NONOate (DETA-NO) as determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Values represent the fold changes of the mean value measured in the vehicle. D, Immunoblot analysis of hDPP-4 and β-actin from hVICs treated with DETA-NO for 48 h. Quantification of the hDPP-4 density relative to β-actin. Values represent fold changes of the mean value measured for vehicle treatment. E, hDPP-4 protein levels in CM from non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD. hVICs treated with DETA-NO were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using Student's t tests.Given that the administration of Nω-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, enhances DPP-4 expression in the aorta,18 we reasoned that NO depletion would trigger DPP-4 expression. NO supplemented with DETA-NONOate (DETA-NO) decreased DPP-4 mRNA expression (Figure 2C) and DPP-4 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in hVICs (Figure 2D). Moreover, DPP-4 protein secretion was higher in hVICs from patients with CAVD than in hVICs from non-CAVD controls and was suppressed by DETA-NO supplementation (Figure 2E).DPP-4 Expression Is Directly Regulated by NF-κB Activity, and DPP-4 Activation Results in the Osteogenic Differentiation of Aortic VICsNF-κB activity is known to be suppressed by NO, which is derived from endothelial cells.19 Because the DPP4 promoter contains a putative NF-κB binding site, we tested whether NF-κB activity directly regulates DPP-4 promoter activity. The elevation of DPP-4 promoter activity was reduced by DETA-NO supplementation in hVICs as well as HEK293 cells (Figure 3A and Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). However, mutating the NF-κB binding site in the DPP-4 promoter led to a significant inhibition of DPP-4 promoter activity, even in the absence of DETA-NO (Figure 3A). These results demonstrate that NO depletion leads to the induction of DPP-4 expression by the activation of NF-κB, suggesting a regulatory link between VECs and VICs. To obtain more direct evidence of the regulation of DPP-4 expression by NF-κB, we examined the effect of the NF-κB inhibitor on DPP-4 protein expression in hVICs. We found that the NF-κB inhibitor significantly reduced DPP-4 expression in hVICs in patients with CAVD (Figure 3B).Figure 3.

A, Schematic of the putative NF-κB binding site in the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) promoter. The underlined letters indicate mutations (MT) in the NF-κB binding site. Human DPP-4 (hDPP-4) promoter activity was measured in valvular interstitial cells (VICs) after transfection with either the luciferase constructs of the wild-type (WT) or MT hDPP-4 promoters followed by treatment with Diethylenetriamine-NONOate (DETA-NO). B, hDPP-4 levels in conditioned media from non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD.

The bar graph presents the AR-positive area measured in each culture dish. D, The calcium concentration in the cells from (C) was measured as described in the Supplemental Methods section in the online-only Data Supplement. E, Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of ALP (alkaline phosphatase), RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2), Sp7 (Sp7 Transcription Factor), and BGLAP (bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein) mRNA from hVICs of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD after treatment with Sitagliptin. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using Student's t tests.The high levels of DPP-4 expression in hVICs from the aortic valves of CAVD cases suggest that DPP-4 plays a role in osteogenic transition, particularly in the phenotypic change from VICs to calcifying cells.20 Thus, we examined the effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor in hVICs from patients with CAVD and age-matched non-CAVD controls. Sitagliptin is a highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of human type 2 diabetes mellitus.21 Sitagliptin treatment significantly attenuated the osteogenic changes in hVICs from patients with CAVD in vitro (Figure 3C and 3D), which coincided with a decrease in the mRNA expression of osteogenic markers, including alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, Sp7 transcription factor (also known as osterix), and bone γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (also known as osteocalcin) (Figure 3E). Moreover, we confirmed the attenuation of in vitro calcification in DPP-4 knockout mouse VICs (mVICs). When compared with WT mVICs, the alkaline phosphatase staining and activity were significantly diminished in DPP-4 knockout mVICs, even after osteogenic stimulation (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).DPP-4 Induces the Osteogenic Transition of Aortic Valvular Interstitial Cells by Inactivating IGF-1-Mediated SignalingWe believe that the peptidase activity of DPP-422,23 might promote osteogenic changes in VICs. The addition of DPP-4 and its substrate, IGF-1, to hVICs induced osteogenic differentiation; however, none of the other DPP-4 substrates affected VIC calcification (Figure 4A). IGF-1 is known to inhibit osteogenic changes in vascular smooth muscle cells by binding to the IGF-1 receptor by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.24–26 The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and Akt on IGF-1 stimulation in hVICs was suppressed by DPP-4 (Figure 4B). A truncated form of IGF-1, resulting from DPP-4-mediated proteolytic cleavage, displays reduced binding to IGF-1 receptor23 and fails to activate the autocrine system for IGF-1 production.27 Moreover, we found that IGF-1 production was inhibited by DPP-4 but recovered after Sitagliptin treatment (Figure 4C and 4D). DPP-4 treatment increased the osteogenic potential of hVICs in the presence of IGF-1, and this effect was abrogated by Sitagliptin treatment (Figure 4E and 4F).Figure 4. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inactivates insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-mediated signaling to induce osteogenesis in human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs) in vitro.

Values represent the percentage of AR-positive areas compared with the control. F, The calcium concentration in the cells from (E) was determined. G, Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of IGF-1 from hVECs and hVICs of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD. Values represent the fold changes of the mean value measured in the non-CAVD hVEC. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using Student's t tests. H, Immunofluorescence staining of IGF-1 in the aortic valves of non-CAVD controls and patients with CAVD. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Merged images (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI] and IGF-1) are shown. Scale bar, 100 μm.The IGF-1 mRNA levels in hVICs from patients with CAVD were ≈2.5-fold lower than those from non-CAVD controls (Figure 4G). These findings suggest that DPP-4 limits autocrine IGF-1 signaling by the enzymatic degradation of IGF-1, thus leading to VIC calcification. Therefore, we hypothesized that IGF-1 levels could be associated with CAVD progression and analyzed the tissue levels of IGF-1 in patients with CAVD. The expression of IGF-1 protein in the aortic valve (Figure 4H) was lower than those in non-CAVD controls, indicating a negative association between IGF-1 levels and CAVD.Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 Inhibitor, Reduced Calcified Lesion Formation in eNOS−/− Mice by Restoring IGF-1 SignalingeNOS−/− mice are used as an animal model of aortic valve calcification.3,28 DPP-4 was found to be upregulated in the calcified regions of the aortic valve leaflets of eNOS−/− mice, as demonstrated by Von Kossa-positive staining (Figure 5A). The DPP-4 mRNA expression in the aortic valve (Figure 5B) and circulating DPP-4 protein levels (Figure 5C) were higher in eNOS−/− mice than in WT mice. Thereafter, we evaluated the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors for treating aortic valve calcification in eNOS−/− mice. Fluorescence reflectance imaging, with a bisphosphonate-conjugated molecular imaging agent, showed that eNOS−/− mice had much higher levels of calcification of the aortic root and valve than WT mice (Figure 5D, 5E, and 5F). The oral administration of Sitagliptin decreased in vivo calcification (Figure 5D) as well as Von Kossa-stained regions and calcium deposition in the aortic valves of eNOS−/− mice, compared with those receiving vehicle treatment (Figure 5E and 5F).Figure 5.

P values were obtained using Student's t tests.Moreover, Sitagliptin treatment significantly inhibited osteogenic changes in eNOS−/− mVICs in vitro (Figure 6A and 6B) and decreased the mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, Sp7, and bone γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (Figure 6C), similar to that noted in hVICs. IGF-1 treatment attenuated the osteogenic changes in eNOS−/− mVICs, which was diminished by DPP-4 treatment (Figure 6D and 6E). Sitagliptin treatment significantly inhibited DPP-4-mediated osteogenic differentiation (Figure 6D and 6E). Moreover, the plasma IGF-1 levels in eNOS−/− mice were ≈3-fold lower than those in WT mice but increased after Sitagliptin treatment (Figure 6F).Figure 6.

P values were obtained using Student's t tests.Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis Can Be Prevented by DPP-4 Inhibition With Sitagliptin in a Rabbit Model of CAVDWe induced aortic valve stenosis and significant calcium deposition through a combination diet with high-cholesterol and vitamin D (vit.D2) supplements in rabbits as described previously.29,30 The rabbits were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the diet and were followed for 12 weeks: (1) the control group (fed a normal diet), (2) the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, and (3) the Sitagliptin group (treated with 15 mg/kg/day of Sitagliptin, with a cholesterol-vit.D2 diet). Table II in the online-online Data Supplement summarizes the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics over the study period in all 3 groups. There was no significant difference in animal weight among the 3 groups at the time of sacrifice. The baseline echocardiographic measurements were also comparable in all 3 groups (Table II in the online-online Data Supplement).Although aortic valve cusps were thickened and became hyperechogenic after 12 weeks in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, the administration of Sitagliptin markedly reversed cusp morphology similar to that observed in the control group (Figure 7A). Moreover, the aortic valve area, measured using the standard continuity equation, remained unchanged in the Sitagliptin group but significantly decreased in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group (Figure 7B). Continuous-wave Doppler assessment of aortic valve function indicated that the cholesterol-vit.D2 group had much higher levels of transaortic maximal velocity at 12 weeks (Figure 7C and 7D). The mean transaortic pressure gradients were also significantly increased in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group (Figure 7E). However, when Sitagliptin was orally administered, no change in the Doppler parameters was noted (Figure 7C, 7D, and 7E), indicating the therapeutic effect of DPP-4 inhibition by the attenuation of cholesterol-vit.D2 diet-induced aortic valve stenosis in a rabbit model. These results support our hypothesis that the inhibition of DPP-4 can resolve aortic valve calcification and significant aortic stenosis in vivo.Figure 7. Effect of Sitagliptin on the aortic valve in a rabbit model with calcific aortic valve disease as determined by echocardiographic assessment. A, Representative 2-dimensional echocardiographic images of the aortic valve cusp at 12 weeks after treatment initiation. The aortic valves were imaged in the parasternal short axis (Upper) and long axis (Lower) views to assess valve morphology. In the control group fed a normal diet, the aortic valve shows a barely visible thin structure. However, in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet and vitamin D2 supplements (Chol+Vit.D2), the aortic cusps had become thickened and hyperechogenic (arrows). Treatment with Sitagliptin (Chol+Vit.D2 +Sitagliptin) could reverse the valve morphology to a similar state as in the control group. B, The aortic valve area (AVA) was measured using the standard continuity equation. C, Continuous-wave Doppler was used to measure the integral of the transvalvular flow to be utilized in the continuity equation for AVA calculation and to record the transaortic (D) peak velocity (Vmax) and (E) mean pressure gradients. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using nonparametric matched data analysis and a Wilcoxon's signed rank test.The therapeutic effects were observed in a dose-dependent manner and were generally greater for rabbits receiving a higher dose (8 or 15 mg/kg) of Sitagliptin than for rabbits receiving a relatively lower dose (4 mg/kg) (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement). Despite treatment with high-dose Sitagliptin, the rabbits did not show any evidence of hypoglycemia (Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement). Although the blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, compared with the control group, the levels were decreased in the Sitagliptin group and remained within the normal range for rabbits at 3 weeks (Figure VA in the online-only Data Supplement) and at 12 weeks (Figure VB in the online-only Data Supplement).Hematoxylin-eosin staining demonstrated the marked thickening of the aortic valve cusps, related to increased cellularity (Masson trichrome stain), in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, compared with the control group (Figure VI in the online-only Data Supplement, Figure 8A and 8B). In contrast, the cusps from the Sitagliptin group were relatively thin, and calcium deposits (alizarin red stain) were localized to a much lesser extent than in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group (Figure VI in the online-only Data Supplement, Figure 8A and 8B). A greater number of macrophages infiltrated the aortic side of the cusp in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group, whereas only a few macrophages were detected in the aortic cusps of rabbits treated with Sitagliptin (Figure VI in the online-only Data Supplement, Figure 8A and 8B). The plasma DPP-4 activity in the cholesterol-vit.D2 group showed a marked elevation, compared with that in the control group at 6 and 12 weeks (Figure 8C, Figures VIIA and VIII in the online-only Data Supplement), which was associated with lower plasma IGF-1 level (Figure 8D, Figure VIIB in the online-only Data Supplement). However, the rabbits treated with Sitagliptin displayed high plasma IGF-1 levels (Figure 8D, Figure VIIB in the online-only Data Supplement) and significantly suppressed DPP-4 activities over a 12-week period (Figure 8C, Figures VIIA and VIII in the online-only Data Supplement). This result supports our hypothesis that low plasma IGF-1 levels are associated with CAVD progression, and that Sitagliptin treatment significantly increased plasma IGF-1 levels, which subsequently diminished the osteogenic changes in the aortic valve leaflets and prevented CAVD progression in vivo.Figure 8.

An asterisk indicates the aortic side of the cusp. Scale bar, 200 μm. Hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining demonstrates marked thickening on the aortic side of the cusp in the high-cholesterol diet and vitamin D2 supplements (Chol+Vit.D2) group. This thickening is associated with an increase in cellularity (Masson trichrome stain [MT]), macrophage infiltration (RAM-11 immunostain), and calcification (alizarin red [AR] stain). C, Plasma DPP-4 activity and (D) IGF-1 levels were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, or 12 weeks. Each group comprised ≥5 animals. Data represent the mean±standard deviation. P values were obtained using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. ND indicates normal diet.DiscussionIn the present study, we observed a novel mechanism wherein endothelial cell dysfunction, resulting in significantly low NO levels, increased the DPP-4 expression by NF-kB signaling and promoter binding in aortic VICs. Furthermore, we found that IGF-1 is a potential substrate for DPP-4 that mediates calcification and showed that treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor is protective against the progression of aortic valve calcification in animal models. Thus, these findings reveal potential new mechanisms of aortic valve calcification, which suggest DPP-4 and IGF-1 as mediators of osteogenic transformation in VICs.Recently, the nonglycemic effect of DPP-4 has been reported to be beneficial in a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 protects against myocardial infarction,31 ischemia/reperfusion injury,32 and cardiac hypertrophy33 in animal models. DPP-4 inhibitors have also been found to improve endothelial dysfunction34 and attenuate inflammation and subsequent plaque development in the vascular systems of human patients,35 thus leading to therapeutic benefits in cardiovascular disease. However, the issue of the potential association with heart failure is unclear. In a recent, large randomized study,36 no difference was observed in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. Moreover, a retrospective, large cohort study37 also found no evidence of an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure with DPP-4 inhibitors among patients with and without cardiovascular disease history at baseline. These reports support previous observations of the potential beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibition on heart failure.38,39 To our knowledge, this is the first report on the nonglycemic function of DPP-4 as part of the mechanism of valvular heart disease, particularly in aortic valve calcification. We suggest that the main mechanisms of CAVD development and progression are the DPP-4 overexpression, which is triggered by endothelial dysfunction, and the increased enzymatic activity, which leads to the suppression of IGF-1 activity.IGF-1 is an anabolic growth hormone with pleiotropic actions on the cardiovascular system.40 IGF-1 signaling regulates contractility, metabolism, hypertrophy, autophagy, senescence, and apoptosis in the heart. IGF-1 deficiency is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas the cardiac activation of the IGF-1 receptor protects against the detrimental effects of a high-fat diet and myocardial infarction.41 Moreover, IGF-1 was found to protect against endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic plaque development, and metabolic syndrome, thus indicating that IGF-1 can serve as a vascular protective factor.42 The protective effect of IGF-1 on the proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells has already been reported.43,44 Along with the coincidental vascular calcification with bone loss or osteoporosis, regulatory mechanisms of IGF-1 on vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic transformation to osteogenic-like cells were considered to have a potential clinical implication for osteoporosis therapy.44 However, its potential implication for the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of VICs has yet to be reported. In the present study, we sought to identify the other important roles of IGF-1 signaling in the onset and progression of CAVD. In particular, we determined the critical role of IGF-1 signaling in the downstream mechanism after DPP-4 activation in CAVD through mechanistic studies on cultured hVICs. The addition of DPP-4 and IGF-1, as its substrate, to hVICs induced osteogenic differentiation. However, none of the other DPP-4 substrates affected VIC calcification. We found that IGF-1 production was inhibited by DPP-4, which recovered after the administration of a specific DPP-4 inhibitor, Sitagliptin. Furthermore, the administration of the DPP-4 inhibitor reduced the osteogenic changes in hVICs and mVICs by reestablishing the activity of IGF-1 (Figure IX in the online-only Data Supplement), and direct inhibition of IGF1 signaling using IGF-1 receptor antagonist resulted in enhancement of in vitro calcification of hVICs and increased aortic valve calcification in eNOS-/- mice (Figure X in the online-only Data Supplement). These observations suggest a direct relationship between DPP-4 and IGF-1, thereby adding support to the notion that DPP-4 and IGF-1 are key proteins regulating valvular calcification. Considering the current lack of medical therapy for CAVD, these findings have potential clinical implications suggesting a novel target of CAVD with a new molecular mechanism. Because IGF-1 also protects against fibrosis,41,45 an earlier pathological process in CAVD progression,46 targeting the IGF-1 pathway to protect both fibrosis and calcification provides a theoretical advantage to prevent CAVD development and progression, compared with targeting other pathways that affect calcification alone.47,48The most interesting finding in the present study is a regulatory link between VECs and VICs that plays a critical role in the osteogenic transformation of VICs and CAVD progression (Figure VIII in the online-only Data Supplement). The functional relationship between VECs and VICs in the aortic valve is intrinsic to the maintenance of aortic valve tissue homeostasis and the prevention of calcification.49,50 In the present study, we found that NO depletion in human VECs leads to the induction of DPP-4 expression by NF-kB activation in hVICs. Moreover, we noted that the alteration of DPP4 activity induces the suppression of IGF-1 signaling, which leads to the transdifferentiation of VICs to osteogenic cells. These results suggest that the interaction between VECs and VICs is important in regulating DPP-4 activity and IGF-1 signaling as novel mediators of osteogenic transformation of VICs (Figure XI in the online-only Data Supplement). Our findings support the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction contributes to CAVD by initiating the calcification of the neighboring VICs in a paracrine manner.51In summary, we found that DPP-4 was a potential player in aortic valve calcification and showed that DPP-4 could serve as a novel molecular therapeutic target for treating CAVD. Given that no effective treatment option exists other than invasive valve replacement procedures in patients with advanced CAVD, successful repositioning of DPP-4 inhibitors to halt CAVD progression is expected to result in a revolutionary paradigm shift in the management of patients with CAVD.LimitationsWe assessed the levels of DPP-4 or IGF-1 in cultured VICs from patients with CAVD and also in animal models of aortic valve calcification. However, in the present study, it was not possible to fully evaluate whether the plasma levels of DPP-4 and IGF-1 were useful biomarkers for CAVD. In particular, such a finding cannot be made through a single observation in a small cohort of patients with aortic stenosis. Thus, further proof-of-concept studies and applications in a large population are needed to obtain sufficient evidence to support the potential use of DPP-4 and IGF-1 as biomarkers in CAVD. However, the absence of these supporting data would not diminish the importance of the DPP-4–IGF-1 axis in the pathogenesis of CAVD. We believe that the local alterations of DPP-4 activity and IGF-1 signaling in aortic valve tissue, rather than the systemic changes in the plasma, would be more important in the pathophysiological processes leading to CAVD in humans.Although our in vivo observations in mice and rabbits were consistent with in vitro data using VICs from patients with CAVD, the clinical efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors needs to be further tested. Some differences might be found in the distribution of various DPP-4 inhibitors in organs and tissues. Hence, it is crucial to define an adequate dose of a specific DPP-4 inhibitor, in compliance with its tissue distribution, that is most effective for attenuating the nonglycemic function of DPP-4 to halt CAVD progression. Furthermore, the potential impact of our novel pathway on other possible calcification mechanisms, including circulating progenitors,52 endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition,53 and nonosteogenic calcification,54 needs to be evaluated.Thus, our results show that DPP-4-dependent IGF-1 inhibition in VICs contributes to the osteogenic differentiation of valve cells and leads to aortic valve calcification. We believe that this may be a novel mechanism underlying CAVD, and we suggest that DPP-4 could serve as a potential therapeutic target to halt CAVD progression.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to Sung-Cheol Yun, PhD, for providing statistical support.Sources of FundingThis work was supported by grants of the Korea Health Technology R&amp;D Project funded by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea (HI14C19160000), the Basic Science Research Program funded by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (2013R1A1A3010455), the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education (2014R1A6A3A04056205), and the Asan Institute for Life Sciences and Corporate Relations of the Asan Medical Center (14–021).Footnotes*Drs Choi and S.

Visualization of ligand-induced transmembrane signaling in the full-length human insulin receptor,"IntroductionThe insulin receptor (IR) is a ubiquitously expressed receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is of fundamental importance for the regulation of glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism and growth (Saltiel and Kahn, 2001). Its dysfunction has been linked to severe pathologies including diabetes mellitus, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease (Haeusler et al., 2018).In the canonical model of RTK signaling, receptor activation is mediated by ligand-induced dimerization and oligomerization (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990). However, a subset of RTKs can form noncovalent but inactive dimers before ligand binding (Maruyama, 2014; Freed et al., 2015). IRs are unique among RTKs in that they exclusively exist as covalently linked (αβ)2 homodimers at the cell surface (Fig. 1 A). Independent of their oligomeric state, all RTKs are activated by their cognate ligands, arguing that distinct allosteric changes within the dimeric receptor structure may contribute to receptor activation and signaling outcome (Maruyama, 2014; Freed et al., 2017).Figure 1.

Experimental details are provided in the In vitro phosphorylation assay and SDS-PAGE and Western blots sections in Materials and methods as well as Figs. S1 and S2.Our structural understanding of IRs derives largely from crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies of receptor fragments (Hubbard et al., 1994; McKern et al., 2006; Menting et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Cabail et al., 2015; Croll et al., 2016), most notably those of an unliganded ectodomain (Croll et al., 2016) and a truncated ectodomain in complex with insulin (Menting et al., 2013). Attempts to image full-length IRs by EM yielded inconclusive results and did not reveal ligand-dependent structural changes (De Meyts and Whittaker, 2002), leaving the structural basis for transmembrane signaling to be elucidated (De Meyts, 2015; Tatulian, 2015).To obtain insights into IR activation, we reconstituted recombinant full-length IR into lipid nanodiscs and visualized them by single-particle EM. In the absence of insulin, the IR ectodomain adopted the symmetric inverted U-shaped conformation described in previous studies of the ectodomain (Tulloch et al., 1999; McKern et al., 2006; Croll et al., 2016). Upon insulin binding, however, the receptor ectodomain converted into a T-shaped conformation that brought the transmembrane domains together, presumably facilitating autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domains.Results and discussionTo elucidate the mechanism underlying transmembrane IR signaling, we produced recombinant full-length human (αβ)2 IRs (Fig. 1 A) in freestyle HEK293F cells, purified them in CHAPS to near-homogeneity by a single affinity chromatography step, and used membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs; Denisov et al., 2004; Schuler et al., 2013) to reconstitute them into lipid nanodiscs (Fig. 1, B and C; and Fig. S1). For reconstitution, we used a ternary lipid mixture consisting of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol at a ratio that forms homogeneous membranes in the liquid-disordered phase (Tumaneng et al., 2010). Assaying kinase activity upon exposure to insulin demonstrated increased autophosphorylation activity over basal levels for both the detergent-solubilized and the nanodisc-embedded IR (Figs. 1 D and S2), although the latter exhibited considerably higher background activity.Inactive IRs exhibit an inverted U-shaped ectodomain conformation and well-separated transmembrane domainsFull-length IRs were first reconstituted with MSP1E3D1, an MSP variant that forms nanodiscs of ∼12 nm in diameter (Denisov et al., 2007), and the resulting structures were imaged by negative-stain EM. Although heterogeneous, many particles showed circular shapes representing nanodiscs, from which additional densities extended (Fig. S3 A). About 10,000 interactively selected particles were subjected to K-means classification into 200 classes (Fig. S3 B) and to iterative stable alignment and clustering (ISAC; Fig. S3 C; for classification details, see Table S1). K-means classification assigns every particle to one of the specified number of classes and can therefore be used to quantify particle populations (see numbers throughout the study). ISAC only uses a subset of the particles, namely those that fall into stable and reproducible classes. ISAC is thus not suitable to quantify particle populations, but it produces averages with very reliable and crisp features (for more details, see Yang et al., 2012). Some ISAC averages revealed an L-shaped density extending from a nanodisc (Fig. S3 C), presumably representing unprocessed monomeric IRs (see Fig. 2 for an interpretation of the 2D class averages in terms of the 3D structures they likely represent). Because monomeric IRs do not exist at the cell surface under physiological conditions (Hedo et al., 1983), they will not be discussed further. Many ISAC averages showed an inverted U-shaped density that either extended from a single nanodisc (20%; see the Image processing section of Materials and methods for estimation of particle populations; Fig. 3 A, top) or connected two nanodiscs (80%; Fig. 3 A, bottom). The width of the U-shaped density (∼8–11 nm) was consistent with the respective IR ectodomain dimension seen in a previous negative-stain EM study (Tulloch et al., 1999) and in crystal structures (McKern et al., 2006; Croll et al., 2016). The unliganded ectodomain extended 8.5–10 nm from the edge of the nanodiscs, which presumably is an underestimation of the total length of the ectodomain because the nanodisc density makes it impossible to identify the precise position where the protein emerges from the membrane. However, as most IR dimers reconstituted into two separate nanodiscs, the two transmembrane domains must generally be well separated from each other in unliganded receptors.Figure 2. Schematic illustration of the conformations assigned to IRs in nanodiscs. (A and B) Representative class averages (A) and schematic drawings (B) of IRs in nanodiscs adopting different conformations: U-shaped dimer (ectodomain in red) in one (1U) or two nanodiscs (2U), T-shaped dimer (ectodomain in blue) in one (1T and II) or two nanodiscs (2U), and L-shaped monomer (ectodomain in dark gray) in one nanodisc (L). (C) Models of how the nanodisc-embedded IRs may look in solution. Because the tyrosine kinase domains are flexibly tethered to the transmembrane domains, their locations are somewhat speculative, especially in the 2T conformation. Note, however, that extra density in the class averages of the 1T and II conformations may represent tyrosine kinase domain dimers.Figure 3. Selected EM averages of IRs reconstituted into MSP1E3D1 nanodiscs and ligand-induced IR activation. (A) In the absence of insulin, IRs reconstituted into one nanodisc (1U; top) or two nanodiscs (2U; bottom) and adopted a U-shaped conformation. (B) Upon insulin addition, all IRs in a single nanodisc adopted the T-shaped conformation (1T; middle), whereas IRs in two nanodiscs adopted either the U-shaped (top) or T-shaped conformation (2T; bottom). (C) In the presence of insulin, all IRs reconstituted into a single nanodisc. Most of them adopted a T-shaped conformation (top), whereas some showed an II-shaped conformation (II), likely representing a different view of IRs in the T-shaped conformation (bottom). The first three averages show a globular density that may represent dimerized tyrosine kinase domains (TKDs; arrows). (D) Upon insulin addition, all IRs showed a T-shaped conformation. The side length of individual panels is 47.7 nm. (E) Quantification of IR populations with a particular ectodomain (ECD) conformation at given insulin concentrations. (F) Cartoon illustrating the ligand (green) binding–induced conformational change in the ectodomain and its coupling to the transmembrane domains (TMDs) with concomitant activation of the tyrosine kinase domains by autophosphorylation (red asterisks). Our experimental data imply that binding of one ligand is sufficient to induce the transition of the IR ectodomain from the U-shaped to the T-shaped conformation. Insulin binding results in structural rearrangements of the receptor that allow the transmembrane domains to come togetherLigand binding by IRs displays negative cooperativity. The first ligand binds with high affinity and is suggested to suffice for receptor activation under physiological ligand concentrations (Lee and Pilch, 1994). At concentrations of ∼1–100 nM, a second insulin molecule can bind with lower affinity but accelerates dissociation of the first ligand. At ligand concentrations &gt;1 µM, three insulin molecules may occupy the receptor (De Meyts and Whittaker, 2002; Kiselyov et al., 2009).To understand the consequences of insulin binding, IRs were first incubated with a saturating insulin concentration of 1 µM before they were reconstituted into nanodiscs. EM images of this IR preparation showed that all receptors were incorporated into a single nanodisc (Fig. 3 C). All averages showed a dramatic conformational change in the ectodomains from the U-shaped conformation predominantly to a T-shaped conformation (∼72%; Fig. 3 C, top). A smaller fraction showed II-shaped ectodomains (26%), presumably representing a different view of the T-shaped conformation (Fig. 3 C, bottom). Additional exposure to 1 µM insulin after reconstitution showed that all dimeric IR ectodomains adopted the T-shaped conformation (Fig. 3 D). Importantly, because all ligand-bound IR dimers were incorporated into a single nanodisc, the two transmembrane domains must be in close proximity and presumably interact with each other.To confirm that the conformational change also occurs in membrane-embedded IRs, we used IRs reconstituted into nanodiscs in the absence of insulin (Fig. 3 A) and exposed them to 1 µM insulin. Averages still revealed IRs in the U-shaped conformation connecting two nanodiscs (Fig. 3 B, top), but these constituted a smaller fraction (∼53%). Strikingly, all IRs that were reconstituted into a single nanodisc appear to have undergone the conversion from the U-shaped to the T-shaped conformation upon insulin binding (Fig. 3 B, middle). The T-shaped receptors had a wingspan of ∼12.5–14.5 nm and extended ∼11–13.5 nm from the edge of the nanodiscs. In addition, averages now also showed T-shaped IRs extending from two nanodiscs (∼16%; Fig. 3 B, bottom). From these results, ligand binding to IRs reconstituted into two nanodiscs should convert their ectodomains into a T-shaped conformation, which, in turn, would exert a driving force to bring the transmembrane domains together. This force will tend to bring the two nanodiscs together, which was indeed seen in some of the averages (Fig. 3 B, bottom). Furthermore, nanodiscs connected by a T-shaped IR in general appeared to be closer to each other than those connected by a U-shaped IR (Fig. 3 B, compare top with bottom). The resulting juxtaposition of the two nanodiscs may only occasionally lead to fusion, allowing the transmembrane domains to interact, whereas in most cases, the two nanodiscs would likely remain separate, preventing the transmembrane domains from interacting.To test whether the transition into the T-shaped conformation also occurs at nonsaturating ligand conditions, we exposed IRs embedded in nanodiscs to an insulin concentration of 12 nM as well as to the physiologically relevant and highly substoichiometric insulin concentration of 0.8 nM. The quantification of the receptors in different conformations (Fig. 3 E and Table S3) implied that one ligand is sufficient to induce the conversion of the IR ectodomain from the U- to the T-shaped conformation.In the absence of insulin, the transmembrane domains are well separatedCrystallographic studies established that in unliganded IRs, the membrane-proximal segments of the ectodomains are ∼12 nm apart (McKern et al., 2006; Croll et al., 2016). We therefore hypothesized that reconstituting unliganded IRs into smaller nanodiscs should increase the number of IRs that incorporated into two nanodiscs. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the above experiments with MSP1D1, an MSP that forms smaller nanodiscs of ∼10 nm diameter (Denisov et al., 2004). As expected, in the absence of insulin, all receptors adopted the U-shaped conformation. More importantly, with the smaller nanodiscs, the two transmembrane domains of the dimeric IRs incorporated exclusively into separate nanodiscs, strengthening the notion that the transmembrane domains do not interact with each other in unliganded receptors (Fig. S4 A). In the presence of insulin, however, even with the smaller nanodiscs, all IRs reconstituted into single nanodiscs (Fig. S4 C). In summary, all results were consistent with those obtained with IRs reconstituted into the larger nanodiscs (Fig. S4).The T-shaped conformation of the activated IR described in this study resembles what has been seen in previous EM images of IRs in detergent and reconstituted into liposomes (Christiansen et al., 1991; Tranum-Jensen et al., 1994; Woldin et al., 1999). These studies, however, did not reveal conformational changes in the receptor upon exposure to insulin, whereas our data now provide direct structural evidence for a ligand-driven conformational change in the IR ectodomain and its importance for signal propagation across the membrane. In the absence of such data, mutually exclusive models have been proposed for IR activation (De Meyts and Whittaker, 2002; Ward et al., 2013; Kavran et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; De Meyts, 2015; Tatulian, 2015). In one model, IR transmembrane domains interact with each other in the inactive state, and insulin binding then pries them apart (Lee et al., 2014). In an opposing model proposed for the homologous insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, the ectodomains keep the transmembrane domains separated in the inactive state. Ligand binding would then release this inhibition and allow the transmembrane domains to interact (Kavran et al., 2014). An inhibitory role of the ectodomain has also been suggested for inactive preformed dimers of the EGF receptor in which the unliganded ectodomain exerts steric constraints to prevent the association of the N-terminal segments of the transmembrane helices (Zhu et al., 2003; Arkhipov et al., 2013). In line with this model, tryptic removal of the IR ectodomain was shown to result in constitutively active kinase domains (Shoelson et al., 1988). Our results unambiguously support the latter model also for IR regulation (Fig. 3 F): insulin binding induced a large conformational change in the IR ectodomain, releasing the constraint on the transmembrane domains and concomitantly facilitating autophosphorylation of the kinase domains. Indeed, some averages of the receptor in the T-shaped conformation showed a strong globular density (arrows in Fig. 3 C) that was not seen in averages of the receptor in the U-shaped conformation, suggesting that the tyrosine kinase domains in these averages may be more restricted in their localization and dimerized.Given the importance of the rearrangements in the IR transmembrane domains, we envision that the lipid environment will have an effect on receptor activation and regulation, a notion that can be tested further using the nanodisc system. Our results also provide novel structural insights that answer longstanding questions concerning the mechanism of how insulin activates the receptor, thus improving our understanding of the receptor and providing new perspectives for pharmacological intervention strategies.Materials and methodsExpression and purification of full-length IRscDNA for human IR isoform A was cloned into a pTT6 vector as described previously (Gerl et al., 2014), resulting in a construct consisting of the human IR isoform A followed by a C-terminal human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site and a tandem affinity purification tag.The receptor was produced in suspension-adapted FreeStyle HEK293F cells (RRID: CVCL_D603; Thermo Fisher Scientific) that were grown at 37°C in protein-free FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1× penicillin/streptavidin at 90 rpm and 8% CO2. Cells at 2 × 106 cells/ml in antibiotics-free medium were transiently transfected with 1 mg/liter endotoxin-free plasmid DNA (precomplexed with polythelenimine at a 1:8 [wt/wt] ratio; Gerl et al., 2014). The cells were maintained for 64 h at 31°C, 8% CO2, and 90 rpm. After harvesting the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min, the cell pellet from 1 liter of cell culture was resuspended in 100 ml ice-cold detergent-free HBS (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl, supplemented with 8 mM Pefabloc, 10 µM E64, and two tablets of complete protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Resuspended cells were disrupted using a tip sonicator (Ultrasonic Homogenizer Sonopuls HD 3100 with an SH70 G horn and MS 73 microtip [3 mm]; Bandelin Electronic) in the absence of detergent by four to six sonication cycles (1 s pulse and 1 s pause for 30 s total followed by 1 min pause at 17% amplitude). Protein purification was performed at 4°C as described previously for EGF receptor (Coskun et al., 2011), except that the pH of all purification buffers was 7.5 and that after the washing step with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol-containing running buffer, the column was equilibrated with HBS supplemented with 1% (wt/vol) CHAPS and 8% (vol/vol) glycerol for overnight incubation with human rhinovirus 3C protease and protein elution.IR concentration was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient of 377,585 M−1 cm−1 as calculated by ProtParam (ExPASy), assuming 42 of the total 94 cysteines are forming disulfide bonds in the dimeric receptor (Croll et al., 2016). The typical yield of purified IR was ∼0.5 mg from 1 liter of cell culture.For quality controls, analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superose 6 3.2/300 column (GE Healthcare) with IR elution buffer at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min at room temperature followed by SDS-PAGE of the collected fractions and silver staining. Purified IR was immediately reconstituted into nanodiscs.Purification of MSP1E3D1 and MSP1D1Plasmids encoding MSP pMSP1E3D1 (20066) and pMSP1D1 (20061) were purchased from Addgene. Both MSP variants were produced in E. coli BL21Gold(DE) (Agilent Technologies) and purified as described previously (Inagaki et al., 2012) with the exceptions that prepacked His-Trap HP columns (GE Healthcare) were used for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and that an additional wash step with cholate was introduced (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, and 32 mM cholate). The His tag was not removed.Reconstitution of IRs into nanodiscs1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), N-stearoyl-d-erythro-sphingosyl-phosphorylcholine (SM), and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. All lipid stocks were quantified on a regular basis to correct for solvent evaporation by a phosphate assay for phospholipids (Rouser et al., 1966) or an Amplex red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen) and were controlled for their stability by thin-layer chromatography. DOPC, SM, and cholesterol were mixed at a ratio of 80:15:5 mol%, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and left under vacuum overnight to remove residual solvent. To better solubilize the lipid mixture containing cholesterol and sphingomyelin and to improve reproducibility, the dried film was first used to form liposomes by addition of reconstitution buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl) with vigorous shaking at 54°C followed by 10 freeze-thaw cycles and 21 extrusions through a 100-nm pore-size polycarbonate filter. The resulting unilamellar liposomes were then solubilized by addition of cholate (Alfa Aesar) to a final concentration of 18 mM and subsequent sonication in a water bath.IRs were reconstituted into nanodiscs in the presence or absence of human insulin (I2643; Sigma-Aldrich). For reconstitutions in the presence of insulin, 0.3 µM IR in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (wt/vol) CHAPS, and 8% (vol/vol) glycerol was incubated with 1 µM insulin for 1 h on ice. Before usage, insulin was dissolved to a concentration of 180 µM in 5 mM HCl. Insulin was added to the IR reconstitution mix to a final concentration of 1 µM. Even though the pH of the solution did not change, the same amount of 5 mM HCl was added to the unliganded receptor to rule out potential effects of HCl on IR. For nanodisc formation, 0.3 nmol liganded or unliganded IR was incubated with 200 nmol cholate-solubilized lipids and 10 nmol MSP1E3D1 or MSP1D1 for 30 min in the presence of 13.2 mM CHAPS at 25°C with gentle shaking at 300 rpm. The reconstitution mix was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was extensively dialyzed against at least a 1,000× excess of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl for 26 h at 4°C with three buffer exchanges followed by a fourth exchange to 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl for 18 h. Dialysis was performed in Spectra/Por 7 standard regenerated cellulose pretreated dialysis tubings (Spectrum Labs) with a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kD (for the first 18 h) and 50 kD (until the end of the dialysis). Because of the aggregation propensity of nonreconstituted MSPs, aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 g for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. IR-containing nanodiscs were separated from empty nanodiscs by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl, and only the peak fraction was collected.For EM experiments of IR reconstituted into nanodiscs with MSP1E3D1, the peak fraction was split into four aliquots. One aliquot was imaged directly by negative-stain EM, and the other aliquots were incubated with varying amounts of insulin (final concentrations of 0.8 nM, 12 nM, or 1 µM) for 1 h at 4°C before imaging. For IR reconstituted into nanodiscs with MSP1D1, the peak fraction was split into halves. One half was imaged directly by negative-stain EM, whereas the other half was incubated with 1 µM insulin (final concentration) for 1 h at 4°C before imaging.The concentration of IR in nanodiscs was estimated by UV spectroscopy at 280 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 438,030 M−1 cm−1 for samples reconstituted with MSP1E3D1 and 420,445 M−1 cm−1 for samples reconstituted with MSP1D1 as calculated with ProtParam (ExPASy) assuming that 42 of the 94 cysteines formed disulfide bonds.In vitro phosphorylation assayA saturating insulin concentration (200 nM) was added to purified CHAPS-solubilized IRs or nanodisc-embedded IRs and allowed to bind for 1 h on ice. Phosphorylation was performed with 0.25 mM ATP in 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM MnCl2 in a final volume of 25 µl and incubated for 12 min at 25°C. For solubilized IRs, the CHAPS concentration was kept at the critical micellar concentration of 0.6% (wt/vol). The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM EDTA. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and IR tyrosine kinase domain phosphorylation was assessed by Western blotting.SDS-PAGE and Western blotsElectrophoresis was performed with precast 4–12% Bis-Tris gels with MOPS SDS running buffer or 3–8% Tris-acetate gels or NativePAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) using the corresponding commercial running buffers (Invitrogen). Proteins were stained with Coomassie blue or silver stain or were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunodetection. Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk powder in TBST (0.1% [vol/vol] Tween-20 in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 µM NaVO4 and 20 µM β-glycerophosphate). Membranes were probed with antibodies against phospho-IRβ (Tyr-1150/1151; 1:1,000; 3024; RRID, AB_331253; Cell Signaling Technology) or against total IRβ C terminus (1:2,000; 3020; RRID, AB_2249166; Cell Signaling Technology). The secondary antibodies goat anti–rabbit IgG (H+L; 170-6515; RRID, AB_11125142; Bio-Rad Laboratories) or goat anti–mouse IgG (H+L; 170-6516; RRID, AB_11125547; Bio-Rad Laboratories) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used at a 1:10,000 dilution, and detection was performed using SuperSignal West Femto maximum-sensitivity substrate electrochemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a charge-coupled device imager (Imager 600; GE Healthcare).Specimen preparation and EMAn aliquot (3.5 µl) of full-length IR reconstituted into nanodiscs was adsorbed to a glow-discharged 200-mesh copper grid covered with a thin carbon-coated plastic film. After adsorbing the sample for 1 min, the grid was blotted with a filter paper and washed twice with buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl), once with deionized water, and once with a 0.75% (wt/vol) uranyl formate solution, blotting the grid with filter paper between each drop, and then it was stained for 30 s with the uranyl formate solution. After blotting the grid again with filter paper, the remaining solution was removed by vacuum aspiration (see Ohi et al. [2004] for further details). Images were collected using an XR16L-ActiveVu charge-coupled device camera (AMT) on a Philips CM10 electron microscope (FEI) operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The calibrated magnification was 41,513× (nominal magnification of 52,000×), yielding a pixel size of 2.65 Å at the specimen level. The defocus was set to –1.5 µm.Image processingImages of nanodisc-embedded IRs showed a very heterogeneous particle population. Therefore, for further image processing, particle selection focused on particles that showed one nanodisc with an additional density extending from them or two nanodiscs connected by a density. For each sample, ∼10,000 particles (the exact numbers of images and selected particles are summarized in Table S1) were manually selected using the e2boxer.py command of the EMAN2 software package (Tang et al., 2007) and windowed into 180 × 180–pixel images. After image normalization and particle centering, the particle images were classified into 200 groups using K-means classification procedures implemented in SPIDER (Frank et al., 1996). For the ISAC algorithm (Yang et al., 2012) implemented in SPARX software (Hohn et al., 2007), the particle images were reduced to 76 × 76 pixels and subjected to several ISAC generations specifying 50 images per group and a pixel error threshold of 0.7 (the number of ISAC generations and resulting number of averages for each sample are summarized in Table S1).To estimate the approximate number of receptors adopting a particular conformation, we used the K-means classification into 200 groups and visually assigned the averages to show (a) a U-shaped IR reconstituted into one nanodisc (1U), (b) a U-shaped IR reconstituted into two nanodiscs (2U), (c) a T-shaped IR reconstituted into one nanodisc (1T), (d) a T-shaped IR reconstituted into two nanodiscs (2T), (e) a II-shaped IR (II; we only observed IRs in this conformation associated with one nanodisc), and (f) an L-shaped IR (L; we only observed L-shaped IRs associated with one nanodisc, consistent with the assumption that these particles represent IR monomers). For each set of averages, the particles in the classes assigned to one of these six classes were summed up and are listed in Table S2. Many of the averages could not be unambiguously assigned to one of the six classes. These classes (X) were considered uninterpretable and were excluded from the quantification. The assignments of the classes for each experimental condition are denoted in Fig. S3 C and dataviewer content showing the 200 SPIDER class averages. In addition, the particles showing the L-shaped nonphysiological monomeric IR were not considered when calculating the percentage of dimeric receptors in each conformation (1U, 2U, 1T, 2T, or II) as listed in Table S3.Online supplemental materialFig. S1 illustrates the biochemical analyses of purified IR and IR reconstitution into nanodiscs. Fig. S2 shows autophosphorylation assays for IRs in detergent and in nanodiscs. Fig. S3 presents EM analysis of IR reconstituted into large nanodiscs with MSP1E3D1 in the absence of insulin, showing an EM image and the class averages obtained by ISAC and K-means classification. Fig. S4 shows the conformation of IR reconstituted into small nanodiscs with MSP1D1 under different insulin exposure conditions. Table S1 provides statistics for EM image collection and ISAC classification. Table S2 provides the numbers of particles assigned to specific IR conformations, and Table S3 provides the corresponding percentages of the dimer population.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion versus multiple daily injection regimens in children and young people at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: pragmatic randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation | The BMJ,"AbstractObjective To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost utility of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens during the first year following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young people.Design Pragmatic, multicentre, open label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.Setting 15 paediatric National Health Service (NHS) diabetes services in England and Wales. The study opened to recruitment in May 2011 and closed in January 2017.Participants Patients aged between 7 months and 15 years, with a new diagnosis of type 1 diabetes were eligible to participate. Patients who had a sibling with the disease, and those who took drug treatments or had additional diagnoses that could have affected glycaemic control were ineligible.Interventions Participants were randomised, stratified by age and treating centre, to start treatment with CSII or MDI within 14 days of diagnosis. Starting doses of aspart (CSII and MDI) and glargine or detemir (MDI) were calculated according to weight and age, and titrated according to blood glucose measurements and according to local clinical practice.Main outcome measures Primary outcome was glycaemic control (as measured by glycated haemoglobin; HbA1c) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were percentage of patients in each treatment arm with HbA1c within the national target range, incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, change in height and body mass index (as measured by standard deviation scores), insulin requirements (units/kg/day), partial remission rate (insulin dose adjusted HbA1c &lt;9), paediatric quality of life inventory score, and cost utility based on the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from an NHS costing perspective.Results 294 participants were randomised and 293 included in intention to treat analyses (CSI, n=144; MDI, n=149). At 12 months, mean HbA1c was comparable with clinically unimportant differences between CSII and MDI participants (60.9 mmol/mol v 58.5 mmol/mol, mean difference 2.4 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval −0.4 to 5.3), P=0.09). Achievement of HbA1c lower than 58 mmol/mol was low among the two groups (66/143 (46%) CSII participants v 78/142 (55%) MDI participants; relative risk 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.06)). Incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were low in both groups. Fifty four non-serious and 14 serious adverse events were reported during CSII treatment, and 17 non-serious and eight serious adverse events during MDI treatment. Parents (but not children) reported superior PedsQL scores for those patients treated with CSII compared to those treated with MDI. CSII was more expensive than MDI by £1863 (€2179; $2474; 95% confidence interval £1620 to £2137) per patient, with no additional QALY gains (difference −0.006 (95% confidence interval −0.031 to 0.018)).Conclusion During the first year following type 1 diabetes diagnosis, no clinical benefit of CSII over MDI was identified in children and young people in the UK setting, and treatment with either regimen was suboptimal in achieving HbA1c thresholds. CSII was not cost effective.Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN29255275; European Clinical Trials Database 2010-023792-25.IntroductionType 1 diabetes is a common, chronic disease of childhood, affecting about 26 000 infants, children, and young people in the United Kingdom.1 Treatment requires administration of subcutaneous insulin in doses calculated according to carbohydrate consumption, physical activity, and blood glucose measurements. During childhood and adolescence, poor glycaemic control is associated with impaired memory,2 poorer cognitive outcomes,3 an increased risk of depression,4 and poor growth.5 In the longer term, vascular complications lead to blindness, renal failure, premature heart disease, stroke, and amputation.6 The risk of developing complications is related to glycaemic control, and is lower in patients treated with intensive regimens on insulin treatment: multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).7 There is no cure for type 1 diabetes, so optimal treatment is essential to enable the best possible quality of life and the effective use of healthcare resources while minimising the risk of complications.A meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials involving 165 children reported a modest benefit of CSII treatment on glycaemic control (as measured by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c); −0.24%, 95% confidence interval −0.41% to −0.07%)8 albeit below the threshold associated with better clinical outcomes (0.5%),7 but no difference in the risk of severe hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.8 However, key limitations need to be considered when interpreting these results. Firstly, in five of the included randomised controlled trials, the observation period was insufficient (seven months or less) for the effects of treatment fatigue to be observed, and might not have been long enough for patients to become fully competent in the use of CSII. Secondly, isophane insulin use in the MDI arm of five included studies limits the generalisability of the results to modern regimens using longacting insulin analogues. Thirdly, in five of the six trials, patients with established type 1 diabetes treated with MDI were randomised to continue MDI treatment or change to CSII, which introduced selection bias. Patients in whom MDI treatment is satisfactory are less likely to be invited or to consent to participate than those patients in whom treatment is inadequate. In a more recent study, patients with established type 1 diabetes in whom MDI treatment was inadequate were randomised to either continue MDI treatment for six months or change to CSII; beneficial effects of CSII on quality of life were reported, but no effect on HbA1c was seen.9 In a small randomised trial comparing CSII with MDI in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and observed for two years, researchers saw no difference in glycaemic control or adverse events between treatment arms.10 Finally, at the start of CSII treatment, there is a period of intense education and frequent contact with diabetes healthcare professionals, which could favourably affect glycaemic control independently of CSII treatment in those patients with established diabetes. In the REPOSE study, when adults with type 1 diabetes and poor glycaemic control were randomised to treatment with CSII or MDI and given equivalent education, no additional benefit from CSII was identified.11Observational studies of national paediatric databases from the United States, UK, Germany, and Austria have reported an association between CSII treatment and superior glycaemic control1213 with only a modest effect. CSII use is lower in patients from ethnic minorities and those with greatest socioeconomic deprivation.141516 Given that glycaemic control and severe hypoglycaemia are independently related to ethnicity and deprivation,141516 there is a risk of bias, inherent to observational data, in estimates of the effect of CSII in these studies.The cost of type 1 diabetes to the UK's health service is significant, with estimates ranging from £1bn (€1.17bn; $1.33bn) to £1.8bn a year1718 and expected to be nearly 2% of total NHS expenditure over the next two decades.17 A cost effectiveness analysis from the REPOSE study concluded that routine use of CSII in adults, without an immediate clinical need, would not be cost effective.19 The economic evidence, which indicates more expensive treatment with CSII to be cost effective in paediatrics,2021 relies on data from limited trials and extensive modelling. Use of CSII in paediatric practice increased from 14% of patients in 2011 to 28% in 2015-16.1 The widespread adoption of CSII, with little evidence of treatment superiority compared with MDI, requires an adequately powered randomised controlled trial, designed to address areas of bias inherent in previous studies. We therefore conducted the SCIPI trial (subcutaneous insulin: pumps or injections?), in which we recruited children and young people newly diagnosed with of type 1 diabetes and compared outcomes after one year of treatment.MethodsTrial designThe study protocol has been previously published.22 In brief, we conducted a pragmatic, multicentre, open label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial, randomising participants to CSII or MDI to compare the treatments' efficacy, safety, and cost utility. The study was conducted in paediatric diabetes services experienced in the use of CSII, in nine university and six local hospitals within the NHS in England and Wales. The study opened to recruitment in May 2011 and was closed in January 2017. The study protocol (supplementary appendix) was approved by the Liverpool East research ethics committee, reference 10/H1002/80.An internal pilot tested study feasibility, and the standard deviation used to inform the power calculation. A consent rate of at least 50%, with no differences likely to be of clinical significance in demographic criteria for age, ethnicity, sex, and deprivation score between those patients who consented and declined to participate was required to proceed to the full study. Study sites were selected on the basis of the availability of a core set of experienced staff who had completed a recognised course on insulin pump therapy and had their competencies assessed and authorised.ParticipantsPatients aged between 7 months and 15 years and with new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes were eligible to participate. Patients with the following characteristics were ineligible: previous treatment for type 1 diabetes, haemoglobinopathy, coexisting conditions or treatment likely to affect glycaemic control, psychological or psychiatric disorder, an allergy to a component of insulin aspart or determir (Novo Nordisk, Gatwick, UK) or insulin glargine (Sanofi, Guildford, UK), and a sibling with type 1 diabetes. Patients with thyroid disease or coeliac disease were eligible if thyroid hormone concentrations or coeliac antibodies demonstrated good adherence to treatment. Patients and carers were given written and age appropriate information about the study at diagnosis, supplemented by a video presented by participants and parents from February 2014. Written informed consent or, where appropriate, assent was obtained from carers and participants.RandomisationPatients were randomised to treatment with CSII or MDI using 1:1, web based, block randomisation stratified by age (7 months to &lt;5 years, 5 years to &lt;12 years, ≥12 years) and by treating centre. Participants were recruited by members of their local diabetes service and research nurses trained in the recruitment of paediatric patients. Parents and carers, and, when appropriate, patients, were invited to share reasons for declining to participate.ProceduresWe collected the following data at baseline, from the time of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: blood pH, blood glucose, HbA1c, thyroid function tests, anti-islet cell and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, and tissue transglutaminase or other antibody test for coeliac disease measured per local practice before consent. These measurements were made prior to consent and did not form part of the study protocol. All participants completed a structured educational programme, which covered the syllabus outlined by the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes.23 This included the cause of type 1 diabetes, the use and administration of insulin, hyperglycaemia and correction doses of insulin, hypoglycaemia symptoms and treatment, exercise, sick day rules, carbohydrate counting, the benefits of maintaining optimal glycaemic control for long term health, and blood glucose monitoring. The number of education sessions was recorded to ensure parity across treatment arms. All participants received training on the use of MDI regimen and the Expert glucometer, with participants randomised to CSII receiving additional training in the use of CSII. All advanced pump features were taught, used, and regularly reviewed.Randomised treatment started within 14 days of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Baseline height and weight were documented on the day randomised treatment began. Participants randomised to CSII were treated with insulin aspart, and those randomised to MDI with the shortacting insulin analogue insulin aspart and a longacting insulin analogue, either insulin glargine or detemir, according to local clinical practice. Insulin doses were calculated according to weight and age (see study protocol, web appendix 1), and titrated against blood glucose readings according to local protocols. Participants in both treatment arms used a glucometer that included a so-called bolus wizard, which calculated insulin doses according to blood glucose readings and carbohydrate consumption.Study visits coincided with clinic appointments at three, six, nine, and 12 months. At each visit, the following data were collected: HbA1c, adverse events, height, weight, concomitant treatment and insulin use from prescriptions, glucometer and insulin pump downloads (CSII), and patient kept records (MDI). Participants and carers documented home episodes of severe hypoglycaemia24 and diabetic ketoacidosis in a diary. Treatment diaries and telephone logs were assessed at each study visit for any treatment related adverse events and related serious adverse events.25In addition to self reporting, local hospital databases were interrogated at each clinical assessment to ascertain whether the participant had been treated for a related serious adverse event in the preceding three months. Adverse events were classified according to relation with the injection device, glucometer, insulin, errors in insulin administration, or incidental illness. The Health Utilities Index questionnaire26 was administered at baseline and each study visit, and the diabetes module of PedsQL (paediatric quality of life inventory)27was completed at six and 12 months.We measured resource use by using questionnaires and accessing prescription records and electronic, patient linked, information costing systems. These data included the purchase of pumps or MDI injection devices and associated consumables; purchase of insulins; contact with healthcare services including family doctors and school nurses; and hospital inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department attendances.Data were collected on paper based case report forms and questionnaires, and entered centrally at the clinical trials unit into MACRO (InferMed, London, UK), a compliant clinical data management system. Bespoke software was developed to receive data downloaded from glucometers and pumps.Outcome measuresThe primary outcome measure was HbA1c 12 months following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Blood samples were analysed locally and centrally at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, using the Siemens DCA Vantage HbA1c analyser. Within batch precision is less than 6% and between batch precision is less than 8%. A limits of agreement analysis was undertaken for measurements made in different laboratories and by ""point of care"" methods.28 Sensitivity analyses were performed using samples analysed centrally only, at point of care only, and central in preference to point of care if both were available. Secondary outcome measures were the percentage of patients in each treatment arm with HbA1c within the national target range29; incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (hypoglycaemia associated with altered consciousness) and diabetic ketoacidosis; change in standard deviation scores (SDS) of height and body mass index; insulin requirements (units/kg/day); partial remission rate, defined as insulin dose adjusted HbA1c less than 9 (HbA1c (%) + (4×insulin dose (units/kg/day)))30; PedsQL score; and cost utility based on the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained.Statistical analysisSCIPI was designed as a superiority trial assuming a null hypothesis of no difference. To detect a difference in HbA1c means of 0.5% (or 5.46 mmol/mol conversion),31 the minimum difference generally considered to be clinically meaningful,7 with common standard deviation of 1.50 using a two group t test with a 0.05 two sided significance level, 286 participants (143 per group) were required to achieve 80% power. To allow for 10% loss to follow-up, the recruitment target was increased to 316 participants (158 per group).The sample size calculation was based on HbA1c 12 months following diagnosis.32 At the time of designing the trial, the association between HbA1c at diagnosis and longer term outcomes was speculative. Baseline HbA1c reflects blood glucose in the previous three months before insulin treatment. Two exploratory analyses were considered to include HbA1c measured at baseline as a continuous explanatory variable.The intention-to-treat principle was used for the primary analysis such that all randomised participants in whom the outcome was observed were included in the group to which they were randomly allocated. We used a 0.05 level of statistical significance and 95% confidence intervals throughout. The statistical and health economic analysis plans33 were developed before analysis and are available as supplementary material. Analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or Stata (version 13; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Independent statisticians from within the clinical trials unit produced and monitored the randomisation lists and statistical analysis plan,33 and undertook quality control via independent programming for the primary outcome and safety analyses. Blinding of the trial statistician was not possible, but inclusion of every participant within each analysis set was determined before use of allocation information.For the primary outcome (HbA1c 12 months after randomisation), we used least squares regression adjusted for age category and centre as a random effect. Owing to the expected low incidence of events, secondary binary outcomes were presented as unadjusted relative risks. We undertook a per protocol analysis for the primary outcome to check the robustness of conclusions to major prespecified protocol deviations (table S2). Body mass index and height were standardised by use of WHO growth standards,3435 and analysed by analysis of covariance including respective baseline measures, age group, and treatment group as covariates in the model with centre fitted as a random effect. Insulin requirements (units/kg/day) were calculated to reflect insulin use over a four week period, and then analysed as per growth outcomes without baseline measure to reflect the absence of insulin use in this untreated population before randomisation. PedsQL overall score (0-100) at 12 months was calculated as per PedsQL guidelines according to the age specific questionnaires used, and then analysed as per growth outcomes. Partial remission rate at 12 months (defined as insulin dose adjusted HbA1c &lt;9) was calculated using HbA1c, weight, and daily insulin dose, and then analysed as per binary outcomes. We conducted a safety analysis on adverse event data according to the method of insulin delivery at the time of the event. The incidence density rate was used to quantify the number of patients with at least one new case per population at risk in a given time period. The denominators were the sum of the person time in years for each treatment group (accounting for treatment switches) of the population at risk. For the cost utility analysis, we used UK Health Utilities Index Mark 2 tariffs26 to estimate utilities and used the trapezoidal rule to calculate QALYs. Resource use was costed from the perspective of the NHS using the national tariff and other national unit costs. We compared the ratio of the differences between intervention groups in costs and QALYs with the NHS cost effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY. The joint uncertainty in costs and QALYs was considered through 10 000 Bootstrap replicates (bias corrected and accelerated). A lifetime modelled extrapolation was only planned if differences in HbA1c were apparent between intervention groups at 12 months.Patient and public involvementStudy design, delivery, and data interpretation were undertaken in close discussion with patients and their families. Young people were consulted on the design of the study including impact of participation, outcome measures, and study materials. Parents of children and young people with type 1 diabetes were members of the trial management committee and trial steering committee and advised on recruitment strategy. Study results and their significance to patients and their families were discussed in detail with parent contributors.ResultsInternal pilotRecruitment data from the internal pilot study showed acceptable consent rates, showed no evidence of patient selection bias, and supported the parameters used in the sample size calculation. The oversight committees recommended progression to the full study. Data from patients recruited to the internal pilot study were included in the full study.Study participantsBetween May 2011 and January 2016, 976 patients diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes were assessed for eligibility in 15 study centres. Of 689 patients who were eligible and approached for consent, 294 (43%, CSII=144, MDI=149) consented to participate. One patient withdrew before starting their randomised treatment. The sample size calculation was inflated to 316 participants to allow for 10% attrition, but the observed attrition was lower such that the trial was stopped after 294 randomisations to provide the numbers required to achieve 80% power (fig 1). Of patients invited to participate in SCIPI who declined to be randomised, 66% (259/395) stated that they (or their parent/carer) had a strong preference for MDI and 10% (39/395) stated that they had a strong preference for CSII.Fig 1 CONSORT diagram illustrating patient flow from diagnosis to completion of the study protocol. CSII=continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion; MDI=multiple daily injectionsOf those randomised to CSII, 80% (91/114) of participants and 92% (130/142) of parents/carers received their favoured preferred treatment, compared with 37% (41/112) of participants and 28% (42/148) of parents/carers randomised to MDI (P&lt;0.001). Age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation score did not differ between those who consented to participate and those who declined (table S1), or between treatment arms (table 1).Table 1 Baseline characteristics of study participantsAdherence to the protocolA CONSORT diagram illustrating the pathway of patients from diagnosis to study completion is given in figure 1. Retention and adherence data are reported in figure S1 and table S2. All participants received their allocated interventions other than one participant who withdrew consent immediately after randomisation. Of 144 participants initially assigned to CSII, 21 (15%) switched to MDI, and 30 (20%) of 149 participants switched from MDI to CSII. Primary outcome data were available for 97% (285/293) of participants. Primary and secondary outcome measures are provided in table 2 and table 3.Table 2 Primary and secondary outcome measures (continuous)Table 3 Secondary outcome measures (binary)Primary outcomeThe treatment arms were comparable for HbA1c at 12 months, with differences between the treatment arms being small and unimportant in the intention-to-treat analysis (CSII, n=143, MDI, n=142; table 2; table S3 shows full primary outcome results split by age group) and per protocol analysis. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of results to the measurement of HbA1c at central laboratory and point of care (table S4). Figure S2 shows details of HbA1c by age group and at each time point. The study was not powered to detect differences in glycaemic control between age groups. However, the observed HbA1c values were generally lower for the youngest and oldest age groups during MDI treatment, although there is a lot of uncertainty when comparing across groups. A forest plot showed the stability of treatment effect over time (figure S3), despite changes in NHS diabetes care during the SCIPI trial. Forest plots of the primary outcome split by subgroup (figure S4) also showed consistency of treatment effect across age groups and SCIPI centres.The trial was powered to detect a difference in HbA1c between groups at 12 months unadjusted for baseline HbA1c values. The prognostic value of significance of HbA1c at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was not well recognised at the time SCIPI opened to recruitment. Two exploratory analyses were considered to include HbA1c measured at baseline as a continuous explanatory variable (table S5). These results did not alter the SCIPI study conclusions for CSII compared with MDI at 12 months (adjusted mean difference 2.9 mmol/mol, 95% confidence interval −0.02 to 5.9), but did suggest the importance of early baseline values for 12 month measurements (HbA1c level baseline coefficient estimate 0.07; standard error 0.03, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.13).A second exploratory analysis considered the effect of deprivation (table S7). Although we saw an association between higher HbA1c values at baseline and at 12 months with greater deprivation, the conclusions remained unaltered (adjusted mean differences in HbA1c at 12 months between treatment groups (CSII-MDI) were 2.9 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval −0.02 to 5.9) and 2.2 mmol/mol (−0.7 to 5.0), respectively).Secondary outcomesSecondary outcomes were analysed as per intention to treat (table 2 and table 3). We saw no difference in the number of participants achieving HbA1c targets (&lt;58 mmol/mol, the national target until August 2015; and &lt;48 mmol/mol, the target set in August 201528). Change in body mass index and height SDS were similar between treatment arms. Insulin dose data were available for 52% of participants (CSII, n=87/144, MDI, n=64/149). Insulin requirements were higher in those treated with CSII (adjusted mean difference 0.1 units/kg/day, 95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.2, P=0.01), primarily in the oldest participants. The basal bolus ratio for patients treated with CSII, across the lifetime of the study, was 0.8. The ratio started from 0.73 at one month fluctuating up and down throughout the course of the trial, ending at 0.67 at 12 months (figure S5 and table S6). Similar data for MDI were not as robust because they depended on patient reporting.Eight episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (CSII=6, MDI=2) and two episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (CSII=2, MDI=0) were reported. Safety dataset reports events were categorised according to the treatment the participant received at the time of the adverse event, and took into account temporary or permanent switches in the method of insulin delivery. The total number of events experienced and the number of participants experiencing at least one event were provided, along with the incidence density rate (defined as the number of patients with at least one new adverse event per population at risk in a given time period).Of 54 non-serious adverse events reported in 36 participants treated with CSII at the time of the adverse event, 29 were related to the insulin pump, with an incidence density rate of 25.0 participants and at least one event per 100 person years. Of 17 non-serious adverse events reported in 16 participants (incidence density rate 10.5 participants) treated with MDI at the time of the adverse event, two were related to the injection device. Fourteen serious adverse events were reported in nine participants (incidence density rate 6.2 participants) treated with CSII at the time of the serious adverse event, and eight serious adverse events in eight participants (incidence density rate 5.3 participants) treated with MDI at the time of the serious adverse event. Adverse event data are summarised in table 4. Patients randomised to CSII had twice as many related emergency department visits and inpatient stays related to type 1 diabetes (122 visits made by 35/144 patients), compared with those randomised to MDI (60 visits made by 25/149 patients; mean difference 0.4 per patient, 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.9). Reasons for those adverse events recorded as serious are provided in table 4.Table 4 Information regarding serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events recorded during trial periodChild reported PedsQL scores (diabetes module) at 12 months were available for 71% of individuals (CSII, n=104; MDI, n=104), but 26 children in each treatment group were too young to complete the questionnaire. An adjusted mean difference at 12 months of 3.1 (95% confidence interval −0.6 to 6.8) favoured CSII, but the result was not statistically significant. Parents of participants (CSII, n=128/144, MDI, n=123/149) reported a statistically significantly higher score with CSII that with MDI (adjusted mean difference 4.1 (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 7.6)), but this result should be interpreted against meaningful differences being five points or more.36We found 4.3 (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 8.0) more contacts with healthcare professionals per participant treated with CSII (21.2) than MDI (16.9), using texts, emails, and phone calls. Mean total costs were higher by £1863 (95% confidence interval £1620 to £2137) for CSII than for MDI; with the most of this difference (£1177) from the additional cost of consumables and device (undiscounted annual cost of £600 for CSII versus £80 for MDI; table 5). We saw no significant difference in QALYs between CSII (0.910) and MDI (0.916; mean difference −0.006, 95% confidence interval −0.031 to 0.018). The probability of CSII being more expensive and less effective than MDI was 0.69, with no likelihood of CSII being cost effective at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY.Table 5 Resource use in participants treated with CSII versus MDIDiscussionPrincipal findingsIn this randomised controlled trial of paediatric patients with a new diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, CSII treatment was neither more clinically effective nor more cost-effective than MDI, by the standards of the NHS. This non-superiority was consistent across centres and strengthens the lack of evidence to support CSII. There is evidence that glycaemic control in the first year of diagnosis is predictive of longer term outcomes,3738 and this is likely to be a critical period of care. Partial recovery of insulin production during the first year of diagnosis could substantially alter the treatment paradigm compared with the later stages in the course of type 1 diabetes, and our findings should not be applied beyond the first year of diagnosis.Strengths and limitations of studyOur data are strengthened by a high retention rate and consistency of age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation between treatment arms. Furthermore, age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation did not differ between those patients who consented and those who declined to participate. Participants were recruited at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and core diabetes education and contact with healthcare professionals was balanced across treatment arms.Our recruitment rate was lower than predicted and was strongly influenced by early treatment preference. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes has been associated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in parents,39 and for some families it may not have been possible to contemplate randomisation to a new treatment so soon after diagnosis. Had we deferred recruitment, we might have achieved higher recruitment rates. At the point of randomisation, those patients randomised to treatment with CSII were significantly more likely to have received their preferred treatment and it is likely that we recruited a population of patients favouring CSII, which could explain the higher numbers of patients switching from MDI to CSII during follow-up. Examination of glycaemic control at the time of switching did not indicate poorer control. Future studies should examine how preference and disappointment might influence utilisation of randomised treatments.The intention-to-treat analysis included all participants in the group that they were randomised to while the per protocol analysis excluded participants with major protocol deviations, which included switching method of insulin delivery. This difference allows some consideration of the effect, and although both analyses were not significant, the conclusions are robust. In addition, to account for participants who switched method of insulin delivery, the safety population analysed participants in the group to the method of insulin delivery at the time of the safety event.The National Paediatric Diabetes Audit (NPDA) reports improvements in glycaemic control from 2010-11 (72 mmol/mol in England and 70 mmol/mol in Wales) to 2016-17 (64 mmol/mol, both in England and Wales).1 During this period, several national initiatives have been undertaken that are likely to have contributed to this sustained improvement. However, only 15% of patients treated with CSII and 20% of patients treated with MDI achieved an HbA1c within the target range at the end of the first year of treatment. Glycaemic control is poorer in the UK than other European and North America country, where CSII is used more commonly,11 leading to speculation that increased use of CSII could improve glycaemic control. The relative inexperience of NHS practitioners in CSII treatment could have obscured the potential benefits of this treatment. However, study sites were selected on the availability of a core set of trained and experienced staff. We saw no evidence of a treatment effect over time, and block randomisation ensured balance between treatment arms.The development, validation, documentation, and monitoring of an education package and treatment protocols would have strengthened the study, but this would have incurred significant additional cost and delays, in the absence of robust evidence to inform the development of these protocols. Standardisation of educational packages is ideal, but it is important that these can be individualised to meet the needs of patients and their families. The pace at which education can be delivered to an unselected cohort of patients with newly diagnosed diabetes will be more measured than education of selected patients experienced in the treatment of type 1 diabetes, and it might be unrealistic to expect all families to achieve a high level of sophistication in CSII use. Additional education in CSII use could have reduced the prevalence of adverse events in this arm and improved glycaemic control, although this should be set in the context of the adult study, INPUT, which reported no effect of a structure education programme on glycaemic control in patients treated with CSII.40Many adverse events were reported in the study cohort, which is consistent with the background population of patients with childhood type 1 diabetes treated with CSII. The NPDA reports that CSII treatment increased the risk of being admitted to hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis by 23%, and of being admitted to hospital for reasons other than diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia by 27%. CSII treatment did not confer benefit or increased risk from admission with hypoglycaemia.41The speed of technological developments outpaces the time required to deliver a clinical trial. It could be argued that the findings of the SCIPI trial are outdated: technology has advanced, clinical teams have greater experience of CSII, and improved education programmes and psychological support equips patients and their families to manage this treatmemt more successfully with fewer adverse events. However, observational data from the most mature CSII services report benefits in HbA1c below thresholds thought to be clinically meaningful,913 taking no account of the effect of deprivation or ethnicity on clinical outcomes. Enhanced education and psychological support also has the potential to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients treated with MDI. To improve the timeframes required to deliver the evidence, development of a clinical trial platform should be considered.Comparison with other studiesOur findings are consistent with those reported in a smaller randomised controlled trial of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes,9 and previous studies of patients with the established disease.10424344 Authors of a systematic review of adult and paediatric patients concluded that CSII enabled superior glycaemic control and quality of life than MDI with fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia, but cautioned that the inclusion of observational data could have introduced bias.45The reported effect of CSII on quality of life and treatment satisfaction varies.10404142 In our study, parents of participants treated with CSII reported a small, but significantly higher PedsQL score for the quality of life of their children. A qualitative approach could detect differences in quality of life that were not identified in our questionnaire based approach. No adjustments for multiplicity were applied to secondary outcomes, and SCIPI was not powered to detect differences within these outcomes. Consequently, the results should not be judged solely on the presence or absence of statistical significance.Tools for recording insulin use were less robust in those treated with MDI than CSII, and difficulties with data downloads from glucometers and pumps, and missing data in handheld records resulted in a large amount of missing data. In contrast with previous studies,131820 insulin requirements were higher in patients treated with CSII than MDI, which could reflect a reduction in the intensity of MDI treatment as older participants gain independence, or under-reporting. Recognising this uncertainty, our data relating to partial remission should be interpreted with caution.Conclusions and policy implicationsMany patient advocacy groups and healthcare professionals are of the strong opinion that treatment with CSII is beneficial and further research should focus on determining what these perceived benefits are and on developing validated tools to measure them. Individual patients are likely to experience benefits from this treatment that are not directly associated with the outcomes measured in this study. For example, preschool children who consume carbohydrates and exercise erratically could benefit from a treatment with fewer injections and a basal insulin profile that can be modified readily. For the SCIPI cohort, longer term observation is required to assess how treatment in the first year has influenced the trajectory of glycaemic control in future years.Evolving technology that automates glucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustment has the potential to reduce the burden of CSII treatment on patients and families, and enable superior glycaemic control to that reported in SCIPI participants. These technologies are likely to be considerably more expensive than those evaluated in this study and evidence should be sought to support their use.In considering the outcomes of the SCIPI study it is important to recognise three points. Firstly, glycaemic control was suboptimal in both treatment arms. Secondly, patients recruited to the study were newly diagnosed, and more favourable results could be achieved with CSII in patients more experienced in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Thirdly, advances in technology could reduce the burden of CSII treatment, and facilitate superior control in time.In resource limited settings, the introduction of novel, expensive treatment should be informed by robust clinical data demonstrating superiority. Data from the SCIPI study indicate that the use of CSII was neither clinically beneficial nor cost effective in the first year of type 1 diabetes, and resources could be more effectively invested in other measures to improve glycaemic control.What is already known on this topic Intensive insulin regimens, multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), are associated with superior glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetesMeta-analyses and economic evaluations reporting CSII to be a cost effective treatment are based on small randomised controlled trials and observational data, and are subject to considerable modellingResults of a cluster randomised trial in adults with type 1 diabetes (REPOSE) did not support a policy of providing insulin pumps over multiple daily injectionsWhat this study addsIn this randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation of infants, children, and young people in the first year of type 1 diabetes, glycaemic control was suboptimal in both treatment arms CSII treatment was not more clinically effective than treatment with MDI; furthermore, CSII as a standalone treatment was not cost effectiveParents of children treated with CSII, but not the children themselves, reported superior quality of life for their children compared with parents of children treated with MDI, below thresholds thought to be clinically significant",https://t.co/iBPjQSU1z1,papers
Eating and pumping: evaluating the nutrition service of the insulin pump clinic at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. (Insight: Original Research).,"Abstract Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a nutritioninformation session in an insulin pump clinic in improving knowledge andfood choices, and to assess patient satisfaction with the session. Design: An eight-part self-administered questionnaire. Subjects: Twenty-five patients who had attended insulin pumptraining from August 2000 to July 2001 were invited by mail toparticipate in the study. Setting: Insulin pump 'stabilisation clinic' at The RoyalMelbourne Hospital, Victoria. Main outcome measures: Patient-rated usefulness of the writteninformation, retention of nutrition messages, dietary changes made andbest aspects of the program. Results: Sixteen patients responded. Eleven had attended thenutrition session and of these ten received written information. Fourpatients reported carbohydrate counting and glycaemic index as the mostuseful information. Of the 11, eight demonstrated retention of messagesconsistent with nutrition information provided; five made dietarychanges; six reported the best thing about the nutrition session wasconfirmation that their knowledge and food practice was in line withcurrent recommendations; and four suggested a follow-up session and moretime with the dietitian as improvements. Conclusion: Patient-reported improvements in dietary practice andpositive feedback about the nutrition sessions indicate the value ofdietetic education in the insulin pump clinic. As the number of patientstreated with insulin pumps increases in Australia, sharing ofinformation and nutrition research is encouraged to develop bestpractice. Key words: insulin pump, diabetes mellitus, dietary counselling,nutrition education Introduction The importance of nutrition intervention by a dietitian fordiabetes management is well accepted (1,2) and leads to improved healthoutcomes (3,4). In particular, dietary advice on carbohydrate foods isan integral part of nutrition intervention because of the evidence thatdifferent carbohydrate foods affect blood glucose control (5). Through the 1990s the findings of the Diabetes Control andComplications Trial (DCCT) (6) have led to more intensive insulintreatment, designed to normalise glycosylated haemoglobin ([HbA.sub.1C]). One approach used in the DCCT was treatment with insulinpumps, referred to as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. This isa relatively common form of treatment in the US but until recently, hasbeen uncommon in Australia. However, the increased publicity regardingthe positive outcomes with insulin pump therapy (7-9) has led manypatients to seek this treatment in Australia. The insulin pump providesa continuous basal infusion of short acting insulin to reduce hepaticglucose production and normalise glucose in the fasting state thusmimicking the normal function of the pancreas. Before meals, the personinfuses a predetermined bolus of insulin, the dose being based on thecarbohydrate content of the food to be eaten and the blood glucoseconcentration. This treatment approach allows greater flexibility inlifestyle and food choices. A clinic specifically designed to commence people on an insulinpump was established at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. To date, therehave been no published reports of such clinics in Australia, and noreports on the role of the dietitian in these clinics. From theinception of the clinic at the hospital, a dietitian has worked closelywith the diabetes educator and endocrinologist to provide education andadvice aimed at promoting self-care and effective management of diabetesfor people using an insulin pump. Patients commencing with the pump at the hospital undergoone-and-a-half days of training with the diabetes educator to learn tooperate the pump and to set the initial basal rates and pre-mealboluses. The nutrition session is held at the end of the second half-dayand is normally 45 to 60 minutes' duration. Patients training inpairs attend the nutrition session together. For the insulin pump to beeffective, patients must learn to match pre-meal insulin boluses withmeals through carbohydrate counting (10,11). Being able to provide thisinformation in a practical way is an important role for the dietitian inthese clinics (12). Written information available in the nutrition session includesinformation on carbohydrate exchanges and glycaemic index (GI),developed by the hospital's Nutrition Department, and theSanitarium[R] booklets, 'Facts on fat' and 'Sugarupdate'. Most patients attending the clinic have had diabetes formany years and have had previous intervention from a dietitian, butinformal feedback from patients indicated that the information formerlyprovided might not be meeting their needs. The objective of this studywas to determine whether the nutrition information provided was usefuland resulted in improved knowledge and food choices, as rated by thepatients. Method Of the 27 patients who attended the insulin pump clinic from August2000 to July 2001, 25 were invited by mail to participate in the study.This included those who did not attend a nutrition session. Two patientswere less than 18 years old and therefore were not eligible toparticipate. Patients received a package that included a letter ofinvitation, an eight-part self-administered questionnaire (copiesavailable from author) and a stamped self-addressed envelope. A reminderletter was sent one week after the due date to encourage participation. The questionnaire was not previously piloted and included questionsabout age, occupation, height, weight, and the month of attendance atthe clinic. Patients were also asked to indicate the written informationthey received, if they read it, whether it was useful to them, and torecall one of the messages from the nutrition session. Patients wereasked to state whether they had altered their diet, reasons they had notdone so, or if they had, what changes they made. The questionnaire usedopen-ended questions about the most and least useful aspects of thenutrition session and a question about how the nutrition service couldbe improved. The latter question had prompts such as need for follow-up,relevance, further learning requirements and presence of others in thesession. As the number of subjects is small, statistical analyses areinappropriate and the results presented are a descriptive summary. This project was approved by The Royal Melbourne Hospital ClinicalResearch and Ethics Committee as part of routine patient care. Results Of the 25 people invited to participate, 16 responded. Of these 16,11 had attended both the pump training and the nutrition informationsession. Four were unable to attend the nutrition session due to othercommitments and/or the dietitian being unavailable, and the remainingpatient reported he did not require further nutrition education. Table 1summarises the demographics of the 16 patients. Of the 11 who attended the pump training and nutrition session, tenreceived written information. All ten reported reading through theinformation. Four found the information on carbohydrate counting and GIuseful, two reported the sugar update useful, and one found informationon fats useful (see Table 2). Five patients reported making dietarychanges. These included using margarine instead of butter, using lowerGI cereal, including lower GI snacks, changing type of rice eaten,counting carbohydrate more carefully and observing the effects ofdifferent carbohydrate types on blood glucose concentration morecarefully. Those who did attend but did not make a dietary changereported that this was because they were already following an eatingplan that was consistent with recommended guidelines. In contrast, thefive patients who had not attended the nutrition session reported nodietary changes had been made since attending the clinic. The 11 patients who attended the nutrition information session wereasked to recall one message from the session. Eight messages recalledwere consistent with information provided in the nutrition session, twowere not, and one did not respond. Ten respondents provided feedback on'the best thing about the nutrition session'. Six of the tenreported confirmation that they were doing the right things and tworeported the session to be a good update. One patient responded thattheir blood glucose concentration had improved as a result of increasedmotivation and implementation of improved food choices after attendingthe nutrition session. In response to 'the worst thing about thenutrition session', there were four responses. Two were abouthaving to make changes to their dietary practice, one reported theinformation was too broad and the other patient attending dominated thesession, and the remaining patient reported that there was noinformation on the effect of protein on blood sugar concentrations. On 'improving the nutrition service', four patientsrecommended a follow-up session, three suggested more time with thedietitian, and one recommended individual sessions. Otherrecommendations included e-mail access to the dietitian, provision of alist of relevant web sites, a newsletter, eating a meal out with thedietitian to practice carbohydrate counting in a restaurant, andrecipes. Discussion In this study we assessed improvements in dietary knowledge andfood choices, and patient satisfaction with a nutrition informationsession for patients commencing on an insulin pump. The Humber of participants in this study is small, but this form ofinsulin treatment is new and few centres have more than one or twopatients using a pump. Therefore, the results presented in this paperare a summary and have been qualitatively evaluated. A limitation ofthis study is that those who were invited to participate, but did notrespond, may have different views from those who participated. Despitethis, we believe the information provided by patients was informativeand provides a starting point to guide provision of nutritioninformation to patients commencing on an insulin pump. Patients who attended the clinic were generally well educated andwithin a healthy weight range. Few patients found the writteninformation on fat and sugar useful. This is expected as information onfat and sugar is of a more general nature, than GI and carbohydratecounting which are comparatively more complex. The dietitian determinedthe level of patient's knowledge during the consultation and on thebasis of this patients were given appropriate written information.Therefore, not all patients received all available written information. Overall, patients who attended the nutrition session respondedpositively to nutrition education, reporting that even if a specificdietary change had not been made, it improved their confidence with foodchoices. In contrast, those that had not attended the nutrition sessiondid not report any dietary change. Although numbers are small, thisprovides evidence that attendance at the nutrition session should beencouraged and become part of standard practice. It has been suggested that for people with an insulin pump, therecan be an overemphasis on carbohydrate counting that can result inreduced carbohydrate intake and an increase in fat intake (11). This wasnot assessed in this study, but as carbohydrate counting is a keycomponent of nutrition education, it is suggested that a diet historypre- and post-nutrition intervention be used to monitor such dietarychange. Body weight, fat intake, haemaglobin [A.sub.1c] and serum lipids should also be included as routine measures in the clinic. Such measureswould provide objective evidence when researching the role of medicalnutrition therapy in insulin pump treatment. There is currently no suchresearch reported in the literature. Practice guidelines for medical nutrition therapy by dietitians forthe management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes are available (13) andreport that patients are more likely to be successful in improvingdiabetes management with ongoing nutrition therapy rather than a singlenutrition session (12,13). In this study, two people recalled nutritionmessages that were not consistent with information provided during thesession. A follow-up session would be of benefit to ensure correctinformation is retained. Four patients stated that a follow-up sessionwould have been useful. Follow-up sessions are currently beinginvestigated at the hospital's clinic with the model expected to bereferral to a dietitian in community or private practice when thepatient leaves the hospital clinic and returns to his or her ownendocrinologist. In conclusion, following attendance at the nutrition informationsession, improvements in behaviour and food choices were reported, andpatients gave positive feedback about their nutrition session. Insulinpump clinics also provide an avenue for research in medical nutritiontherapy. A collegial approach to patient care with sharing ofinformation, research and expertise is encouraged as the number ofpatients using pump therapy increases.Table 1Demographic information on the 16 patients responding to the mailedquestionnaireCharacteristicAge (years) 31 to 50 (range)Education 9 with tertiary qualificationsWeight (kg) 69 [+ or -] (mean [+ or -] SD)BMI (kg/[m.sup.2]) 25 [+ or -] (mean [+ or -] SD)Table 2Number of patients who received written information and patient- ratedusefulness of it.

"Metabolic Culprits in Obese Pregnancies and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Big Babies, Big Twists, Big Picture","AbstractPregnancy has been equated to a ""stress test"" in which placental hormones and growth factors expose a mother's predisposition toward metabolic disease, unleashing her previously occult insulin resistance (IR), mild β-cell dysfunction, and glucose and lipid surplus due to the formidable forces of pregnancy-induced IR. Although pregnancy-induced IR is intended to assure adequate nutrition to the fetus and placenta, in mothers with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or those who develop gestational diabetes mellitus, this overnutrition to the fetus carries a lifetime risk for increased metabolic disease. Norbert Freinkel, nearly 40 years ago, coined this excess intrauterine nutrient exposure and subsequent offspring developmental risk ""fuel-mediated teratogenesis,"" not limited to only excess maternal glucose. Our attempts to better elucidate the causes and mechanisms behind this double-edged IR of pregnancy, to metabolically characterize the intrauterine environment that results in changes in newborn body composition and later childhood obesity risk, and to examine potential therapeutic approaches that might target maternal metabolism are the focus of this article. Rapidly advancing technologies in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics offer us innovative approaches to interrogate these metabolic processes in the mother, her microbiome, the placenta, and her offspring that contribute to a phenotype at risk for future metabolic disease. If we are successful in our efforts, the researcher, endocrinologist, obstetrician, and health care provider fortunate enough to care for pregnant women have the unique opportunity to positively impact health outcomes not only in the short term but in the long run, not just in one life but in two—and possibly, for the next generation.IntroductionThe power of pregnancy offers the clinician and scientist a unique opportunity to meaningfully affect the outcome of two individuals. Applying observations from the immense field of medicine to optimize the outcome of both mother and her infant, humbled by a placenta that will ultimately determine the exposure to the fetus, is an extraordinary challenge and opportunity. Trained as an internist and inspired by two professors of medicine who were both pioneers in obstetric medicine, I spent my first 12 years pursuing clinical research in thromboembolism in pregnancy, the leading case of maternal mortality at the time. The first major twist along my career path was made possible by two professors of endocrinology who led me to appreciate the profound endocrinologic changes remodeling maternal physiology into an insulin-resistant (IR) state. This transformation of maternal metabolism and its effect on pregnancies complicated by obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) became my research focus over the next 18 years and is the subject of this article.This IR state, not only characterized by hyperglycemia, unearths the already present propensity for mothers to develop metabolic disease and may also promote the future development of metabolic disease in her offspring (1,2). In fact, it was indeed an endocrinologist, Norbert Freinkel, who delivered his seminal 1980 Banting lecture (3) the year I started medical school, ""Of Pregnancy and Progeny,"" who is a founding father of the fetal overnutrition hypothesis. In essence, Dr. Freinkel transformed our thinking about the intrauterine environment in mothers with diabetes, overnutrition, and obesity and the future health implications to the offspring. His described that ""fuel-mediated teratogenesis""—not limited to only maternal glucose but inclusive of maternal lipids and amino acids—could lead to ""alterations occurring subsequent to organogenesis during the differentiation and proliferation of fetal cells,"" which ""could cause long-range effects upon behavioral, anthropometric, and metabolic functions"" (3). The work that follows is a direct result of many inspirational collaborators, especially Drs. Jacob (Jed) Friedman and Teresa (Teri) Hernandez (University of Colorado School of Medicine), aiming to shed additional insights on the 1) causes and mechanisms that underlie the IR of normal pregnancy, obesity, and GDM; 2) metabolic characterization of the intrauterine metabolic environment that contributes to excess infant adiposity; and 3) potential targets and timing of pregnancy interventions to promote healthy short- and long-term outcomes for both mother and child.Lessons Learned on IR From a Mouse With Too Much Placental Growth HormoneEndocrinologists spend much of their clinical time attempting to attenuate IR in their patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or diabetes. Yet, in the context of pregnancy, IR is a critical normal pathophysiologic mechanism to ensure adequate nutrient substrate provision from mother to a growing fetus (4). Unfortunately, when IR in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, or liver and/or some degree of compromised β-cell reserve predates the pregnancy, often seen in women with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and in women who develop GDM, the increasing IR demands of normal pregnancy place further burden on the maternal β-cell to step up secretion. The inability to meet this demand results in excess glucose, lipid, and amino acid exposure to the fetal-placental unit (5,6). This often leads to fetal hyperinsulinemia, which can occur by 16 weeks' gestation, enhanced fetal growth, and an overabundance of maternal substrate for excess fetal fat accretion (7).Textbooks have told us that human placental lactogen (hPL) was the primary cause of this physiologic IR of pregnancy. Yet the data supporting this causation were limited as hPL has both insulin and anti-insulin effects and may actually be more important to stimulate the growth of maternal pancreatic islets and increase lipolysis and free fatty acid (FFA) liberation from adipocytes as an energy substrate (8). The placenta also makes a growth hormone (GH) variant, similar to pituitary GH, that has been known to increase IR in pathologic states such as acromegaly (8). Human placental growth hormone (hPGH) is a product of the human GH variant gene that differs from pituitary GH by 13 amino acids. Its secretion is tonic, increases six- to eightfold throughout gestation, and virtually replaces pituitary GH in the maternal circulation by ∼20 weeks (8,9). We set out to prove whether hPGH, never before characterized by its effect on insulin action, also had the capacity to cause IR. Dr. Andrzej Bartke (Southern Illinois University School of Medicine) was generous to share a transgenic mouse that expressed hPGH at levels similar to the third trimester of pregnancy. Simple glucose tolerance testing revealed that fasting insulin levels were ∼4 times higher than in control mice and ∼7 times higher 30 min after glucose stimulation, confirming pronounced IR. We further showed a marked decrease in insulin sensitivity given that an insulin injection into these hPGH transgenic mice resulted in no significant decline in glucose disposal compared with wild-type mice, who demonstrated &gt;65% decline in glucose levels (10).How hPGH caused IR at a cellular level was our next puzzle. By focusing on the skeletal muscle of these transgenic hPGH mice, we discovered an unforeseen twist that hPGH selectively increased the expression of the p85 regulatory unit of phosphatidlylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), a key effector enzyme necessary for stimulating glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues. In a series of subsequent experiments, the seemingly paradoxical finding of an increase in a subunit of PI 3-kinase being associated with IR was ultimately solved. PI 3-kinase is composed of both a p85 regulatory unit and a catalytic subunit (p110), which must form a p85-p110 heterodimer and bind to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) for PI 3-kinase activation to occur. When the p85 monomer is selectively overexpressed by the action of hPGH, it competes with the active p85-p110 heterodimer in a dominant negative fashion for binding to IRS-1, resulting in a decrease in IRS-1–associated PI 3-kinase activity. We confirmed that this decrease in PI 3-kinase activity resulted in the final step of the insulin signaling pathway being attenuated—a reduction in GLUT-4 translocation to the plasma membrane (11) (Fig. 1). Further, the excess GH-induced IR was completely reversible using a GH-releasing antagonist (12).Figure 1 Simple schematic of the proximal insulin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle of normal pregnancy and GDM. Insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation (P) of the insulin receptor (IR), defective in GDM, which activates the insulin receptor to dock IRS-1. After IRS-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine domains, it triggers the recruitment of PI 3-kinase, a critical enzyme for glucose transport into the cell. GDM women also have decreased tyrosine activation of IRS-1 and reduced IRS-1, in part due to increased serine phosphorylation that increases the degradation of IRS-1 and dampens the insulin signal. The increase in basal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation does not resolve in GDM women who show persistent glucose intolerance postpartum and are at highest risk for type 2 diabetes. PI 3-kinase is composed of a regulatory subunit (p85α) and a catalytic subunit (p110) that must form a heterodimer for PI 3-kinase activation to occur. When excess p85α monomers are stimulated by hPGH in normal pregnancy, it competes with the p85-p110 heterodimer for binding to IRS-1, thereby causing a decrease in the IRS-1–associated PI 3-kinase activity and reduction in GLUT-4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Elevated p85 reverses postpartum with the disappearance of hPGH.Insulin Signaling Changes in Skeletal Muscle in Pregnant and Postpartum Women With Obesity or GDMAlthough hPGH mediated the IR in mice that expressed this placental hormone at levels similar to the third trimester of human pregnancy, ascribing this mechanism to the IR in human pregnancy was still a leap. To translate these findings to human pregnancy, we designed a longitudinal study in which we collected four vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from pregnant women who were overweight/obese with BMI-matched diet-controlled GDM mothers before and after a glucose load at ∼30–32 weeks gestation and again at 9–10 weeks postpartum. Our intent was to also decipher the dynamic insulin signaling changes in GDM mothers who continued to display impaired glucose tolerance postpartum. Not surprisingly, recruitment for these studies, which involved fasting and insulin-stimulated muscle biopsies in pregnant women both antepartum and postpartum, was painfully slow. However, after ∼7 years, our prospective study demonstrated that reduced ability of insulin to phosphorylate the insulin receptor and increased levels of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, similar to our mice, were reversible after delivery, as might be expected given the disappearance of hPGH after pregnancy. However, mothers with GDM also had a decrease in IRS-1 and changes in tyrosine and serine phosphorylation compared with BMI-matched control subjects (13), further dampening signaling. Importantly, some women with GDM had been shown to have a persistent insulin signaling defect with increased skeletal muscle tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) up to 1 year postpartum (14). We also established that GDM women demonstrate impaired IRS-1 signaling–associated increased serine kinase activation, which persisted in women who did not normalize their glucose tolerance postpartum (15) (Fig. 1).Although we hoped that the physiological changes in hPGH in pregnancy would be a straightforward predictor of the degree of IR in pregnancy, McIntyre et al. (16) found hPGH not to be a simple biomarker of the multiple biologic processes that contribute to the overall IR of pregnancy and excess fetal growth, which also include leptin, adiponectin, TNF-α, and IGFBP1. Catalano and colleagues (17,18) have also shown a reduction in adiponectin and PPARγ in adipose tissue that is also associated with tissue-specific IR. While reducing excessive skeletal muscle or adipose IR in pregnancies complicated by GDM might be a viable target for attenuating IR, the mechanisms driving these changes likely have important roles in normal pregnancy. We anticipate that the insulin signaling defects we observed to persist in skeletal muscle of GDM women, in addition to observations by Boyle et al. (19) that AMPK and oxidative phosphorylation are dramatically reduced in the skeletal muscle of GDM women, might lead to specific targeted therapy or physical activity interventions for prevention of GDM and the development of type 2 diabetes postpartum.Why Do Women With Obesity Alone Give Birth to Big Babies?Obesity, which is often associated with IR, is now the leading cause of maternal morbidity and affects nearly 40% of women of child-bearing age (20). In fact, obesity alone accounts for a greater number of large-for-gestational age (LGA) infants than pregnancies complicated by preexisting diabetes or GDM (6,21,22). Many studies have reported strong associations between intrauterine exposure to maternal obesity, excess adiposity at birth, and offspring development of obesity in childhood (2). Fasting, 1-h, and 2-h glucose on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, lower than previously considered as GDM, were correlated with LGA in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study (23) and were recently shown to correlate with glucose intolerance in the 10- to 14-year-old offspring (24). However, Catalano et al. (25) demonstrated in a cohort of 89 offspring from mothers who were normoglycemic or who had GDM that childhood adiposity at 9 years correlated much more strongly with maternal obesity than did GDM, with an OR of ∼5.5. In addition to maternal prepregnancy BMI, the degree of gestational weight gain (GWG) also contributes to excess fetal growth, although overall less so than prepregnancy BMI in our review of the literature (26). The association with excess GWG and adiposity at birth appeared strongest in overweight mothers who gained excessive weight compared with mothers with obesity who gave birth to infants with the highest mean fat mass, regardless of GWG.We hypothesized that given the strong contribution of maternal obesity alone to excess fetal growth independent of GDM (27), women with obesity may have higher fasting and postprandial glucoses than women who are normal weight (NW), although not high enough to meet criteria for GDM. In an extensive review done with Dr. Teri Hernandez of glycemia patterns in normal pregnancy (28), we determined that mean fasting glucose level in NW mothers was 71 mg/dL, 1-h postprandial value was 109 mg/dL, and the 2-h postprandial value was 99 mg/dL with a 24-h mean glucose of 88 mg/dL, all much lower than current therapeutic targets (gestational age 34 ± 2 weeks). In a prospective study, spearheaded by two endocrine fellows, in which we controlled maternal diet while wearing continuous glucose monitors (CGM), women with obesity were shown to have ∼8% higher 24-h glycemic profiles compared with NW control subjects (29). We also identified daytime, nocturnal, fasting, and postprandial glycemic profiles that were useful in characterizing fetal growth (30). In a second highly controlled longitudinal study in which NW mothers and those with obesity received controlled eucaloric diets, we documented mean fasting blood glucose values of ∼73 vs. ∼77 mg/dL at 28 weeks and mean 2-h postprandial glucose values of 87 vs. 96 mg/dL in our NW and obese groups of women, respectively (31). Furthermore, the fasting and repeated measures of postprandial glucose over 4 h both early (∼16 weeks) and later (∼28 weeks) in pregnancy were also ∼10% higher in the mothers with obesity. Women with obesity had larger increases in their 24-h glucose profiles and daytime, nocturnal, and postprandial glucose profiles from early to later pregnancy compared with NW mothers (all P &lt; 0.05) when studied on a eucaloric controlled diet (32). In the women with obesity, the postprandial glucose exposure over three meals early in pregnancy was predictive of newborn percent fat mass (NB %fat), and later in pregnancy, the entire 24-h glucose profiles were predictive in women with obesity (all P &lt; 0.05) but not in NW women (32). This subclinical pattern of mild hyperglycemia, which remains occult and untreated, may in part explain why the prevalence of LGA and macrosomia is higher in women with obesity (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, recent data by a postdoctoral fellow in our group demonstrated that women with obesity who have mild sleep disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index &gt;5) have higher 24-h glucose profiles when on a fixed diet than women without obesity. This suggests that mild sleep apnea, common in women with obesity, may be one of the contributors to elevated 24-h glycemic profiles that could be targeted for treatment (33).Figure 2 Data from controlled breakfast meal studies showing the 4-h area under the curve of plasma glucose (A), insulin (B), and TGs (C) in NW women vs. women with obesity (OB) early (12–14 weeks) and later (26–28 weeks) in pregnancy and the 4-h area under the curve of plasma glucose (D), insulin (E), and TGs (F) in NW, OB, and diet-controlled GDM at 28–30 weeks.In addition to higher glucose levels, our data also showed that fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations, as well as IR estimated by HOMA-IR, are 50–60% higher in women with obesity both early (∼16 weeks) and later in pregnancy (28 weeks) as compared with NW women receiving a fixed diet (31) (Fig. 2B). The higher degree of IR in women with obesity that predates the pregnancy, as shown by Catalano et al. (34) with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies, is clearly present early and worsens later in pregnancy. This additional maternal IR, superimposed on the IR of normal pregnancy, may serve to increase the availability of all nutrients (including lipids and amino acids) to the fetal-placental unit, resulting in excess fetal growth in women with obesity (Fig. 3).Figure 3 Diagrammatic portrayal of the effects of overnutrition on offspring in pregnancies complicated by obesity, metabolic syndrome, or GDM and the potential life-cycle consequences. A woman becomes pregnant with variable degrees of preexisting metabolic dysfunction; her metabolism is furthered altered by the IR of pregnancy mediated by placental factors. Maternal IR in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver along with dietary nutrient excess results in excess glucose (G), amino acid (AA), FFA, and inflammatory cytokine exposure to the placenta. Placental angiogenesis and the transcriptome are influenced by maternal factors and the sex of the fetus, which determine nutrient sensing, metabolism, transport, and ultimate nutrient exposure to the fetus. The fetus responds to excess glucose and AAs with fetal hyperinsulinemia, a potent growth factor, which also promotes organomegaly, adipogenesis, and lipid storage in subcutaneous (SubQ) and hepatic tissue. Intrauterine overnutrition affects stem cell differentiation, mitochondrial function, and appetite regulation in the offspring, and the maternal microbiome is transmitted at delivery. Postnatal factors such as mode of feeding and rapid weight (Wt) gain along with other early life exposures further promote the development of childhood metabolic disease. The daughter becomes a mother and the cycle perpetuates.

Another unexpected twist in our earlier CGM data (29), during which women with obesity on a controlled diet demonstrated higher 24-h glycemic profiles, was that a single fasting TG measured once at ∼14–16 weeks in pregnancy correlated more strongly with NB %fat by skinfolds than any of the glycemic profiles by CGM. The placenta has lipase activity, and the tireless efforts of another postdoctoral fellow demonstrated that the activity of placental lipoprotein lipase, important in hydrolyzing maternal TGs to FFAs that can be transported across the placenta, is highly correlated with NB %fat by skinfolds at birth (r = 0.59; P = 0.006) and even more so when corrected for gestational age at delivery (r = 0.75; P = 0.0001) (40).Although a number of studies have shown that fasting TGs and FFAs contribute to fetal fat accretion, prospective studies in which maternal diet was controlled and which also examined postprandial FFAs and postprandial TGs were lacking (35). In our prospective study that characterized the maternal metabolic environment in mothers who were NW or obese both early (∼16 weeks) and later in pregnancy (28 weeks), we demonstrated that maternal TGs both fasting and postprandially after a controlled diet were a stronger predictor of NB %fat than any of our glucose or insulin measures (31). Fasting TGs and postprandial TGs both at 1 h and 2 h were already ∼30–40% higher in mothers with obesity early in pregnancy compared with NW and also 30–40% higher at 28 weeks (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, in NW women, it was the increase in TGs from early to later in pregnancy that correlated strongest with NB %fat (r = 0.57; P &lt; 0.01) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, in mothers with obesity, it was 16-week fasting TGs (r = 0.60; P = 0.006) and 1-h or 2-h postprandial TGs (r = 0.69–0.71; P &lt; 0.01) in early pregnancy that most strongly correlated with NB %fat, contributed by both VLDL-TG and chylomicron TG (CM-TG) (31). TGs are modestly higher in mothers with GDM compared with mothers with obesity (Fig. 2E), and these data, in addition to others, suggest that maternal TGs are a largely unrecognized substrate for fetal fat accretion, especially in mothers with obesity (31). A larger community-based trial in a free-living environment to confirm the contribution and better characterize the relationship of fasting and postprandial TGs to infant adiposity is the focus of a proposed future trial in women who are overweight or obese.Can We Intervene With Diet? Challenging the Conventional Lower Carbohydrate Diet in GDMEfforts at deciphering the optimal diet for pregnant women have been largely limited to women with GDM given that diet therapy is the first-line therapy and mainstay of treatment. Conventionally, the ""GDM diet"" was one that limited carbohydrates in an attempt to attenuate the postprandial glycemic response (41). However, many mothers substitute fat for carbohydrate (42,43), which may have unintentional consequences of increasing FFAs, which are a strong contributor to worsening maternal IR, promoting further shunting of all excess nutrients to the growing fetus (Fig. 3). Given the lack of rigorous data supporting the use of one macronutrient over the other, the American Diabetes Association abandoned specific diet recommendations for mothers with GDM in 2005 (44) other than ensuring that women receive, at the minimum, 175 g of carbohydrate/day in the second and third trimester. This amount is critical for meeting the energy demands of the placenta and fetus, of which 80% are dependent on glucose.My research colleague, Dr. Teri Hernandez, as a former cardiac nurse, was extremely disconcerted about the potential for a low-carbohydrate, higher-fat diet to have unintended consequences and potentially worsen maternal IR, inflammation and actually promote excess fetal fat accretion. We reconstructed the highly quoted ∼40% carbohydrate/45% fat/15% protein conventional diet described by Jovanovic-Peterson and Peterson (41) and developed a ""challenge"" diet precisely matched in calories and types of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins that only differed in the macronutrient percentages (45). This diet, later termed the CHOICE diet (Choosing Healthy Options in Carbohydrate Energy), substituted 20% of the calories from fat with higher-quality, more complex carbohydrates such that the macronutrient composition was instead 60% carbohydrate/25% fat/15% protein. Both diets were matched for types of fats and &lt;18% of total calories from both diets were from simple sugars. Importantly, given that current literature lacks randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing diets in which all meals are provided, critical in minimizing overlap between the diets, our design provided all meals to the mothers at the time of GDM diagnosis through the remainder of pregnancy. Data from a randomized controlled crossover trial demonstrated that the higher–complex carbohydrate/lower-fat CHOICE diet achieved similar glycemic profiles using CGM (6% higher on CHOICE) and that the mean 1-h (115 mg/dL) and 2-h (106 mg/dL) postprandial glucoses were still well below the targets for GDM (45). The FFAs were significantly lower postprandially on the CHOICE diet. In a follow-up pilot study in which glucose, insulin, FFAs, adipose tissue lipolysis, and NB %fat were measured after the mothers had been randomized to one of the diets for 6–7 weeks, we found that the fasting blood glucose was actually lower on the CHOICE diet (P = 0.03). Furthermore, insulin suppression of lipolysis in maternal adipose tissue biopsies was better on the CHOICE diet, corresponding to lower expression of multiple adipose tissue proinflammatory genes (46). Importantly, NB %fat trended lower on the CHOICE higher–complex carbohydrate/low-fat diet in a limited pilot sample of 12 mother/offspring dyads. The findings are consistent with other RCTs where meals were not provided but also support that diets lower in glycemic index, low in saturated fat, and higher in fiber appear to attenuate excess fetal growth (43,47). The final data from the CHOICE RCT powered for a diet difference in NB %fat as the primary outcome should be available within the next year.The Significance and Challenge in Measuring Body Composition in Babies and InfantsBirth weight is an imperfect proxy for increased infant fat mass given that it includes both lean mass and fat mass. In the cohort of 89 offspring of mothers with normal glucose tolerance or GDM in the study by Catalano et al. (25), increased adiposity at birth (but not birth weight) was correlated to adiposity at 6 to 11 years of age by DXA. Adiposity at birth and during the first 2 years of life when infants triple their fat mass is an important predictor for future obesity risk and metabolic syndrome, much more than birth weight alone. DXA and air displacement plethysmography (PEAPOD) are considered methods with more precision and reproducibility than skinfold measures or bioelectrical impedance analysis and less expensive than MRI techniques (48,49). However, DXA requires infants to be still and exposes them to a very low background level of radiation—a misinterpretation (and unfortunate twist) that halted our recruitment for nearly 1 year. Regrettably, most infants can no longer fit into a PEAPOD by 6 months of life. Given the shortcomings of these different methods and the need to accurately measure fat and fat-free mass throughout infancy, we prospectively measured NB %fat in term infants using DXA, PEAPOD, and skinfolds at ∼10–14 days of life (all three measures taken on same day) and again at ∼1 year of life by DXA and skinfolds. We evaluated two different Hologic software versions for DXA along with PEAPOD and skinfolds and determined how well they correlated with each other and, more importantly, their degree of agreement (48).Consistent with our track record of surprising twists, we found that although the Pearson correlations between the our original DXA software version (DXA1) with the newer software version (DXA2) in newborns were strong (r = 0.89), as with DXA1 and PEAPOD (r = 0.74) and with DXA1 and skinfold estimates (r = 0.69), the actual agreement between DXA1 and the other methods was much less impressive (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.53 with DXA2; 0.62 for PEAPOD and also 0.62 for skinfolds). By 1 year of age, although the correlation between the two DXA software versions was identical to that seen in the newborn (r = 0.89), the agreement was poor (ICC 0.20). The correlation between DXA1 and skinfolds at 1 year was poor (r = 0.50), and the agreement was even worse (ICC 0.11) (48). Unfortunately, these data demonstrate that while DXA, PEAPOD, and skinfolds are highly correlated at birth, the agreement is less impressive such that the methodologies cannot be substituted for each other when following offspring longitudinally. Further, at 1 year of life, both the correlation and the agreement with DXA and skinfolds are very poor, with DXA estimating NB %fat at about ∼3 times higher than by skinfolds in our study. These data support that the same methodology should be used in longitudinal studies. This is problematic given that MRI is expensive and, like DXA, it is difficult to restrict infant and toddler movement, infants will outgrow the PEAPOD after 6 months, and toddler PEAPOD (TODPOD) measures are less available and challenging.Another limitation of DXA, PEAPOD, bioelectrical impedance analysis, or skinfolds is that they do not measure liver or visceral fat, likely a more important estimate of metabolic risk (48). Only MRI spectroscopy is able to measure visceral or liver fat, which is expensive and requires that the infant or child lie still. A pediatric gastroenterologist colleague helped to design methodology, with the assistance of radiology experts, to estimate the liver fat in the newborn offspring from a cohort of GDM mothers who were obese compared with newborns from mothers who were NW. It is very concerning that newborns from GDM mothers with obesity already had a 68% increase in intrahepatocellular lipid at ∼2 weeks of age (50), and recent pilot data support a strong relationship with fasting TGs and postprandial TGs at GDM diagnosis and newborn liver fat (51). Given the steadily increasing prevalence of childhood nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that progresses more rapidly to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in childhood, these findings and others in nonhuman primates by McCurdy et al. (52) strongly suggest that an intrauterine environment characterized by excess maternal fuels from obesity, diabetes, or a high-fat diet may result in TG accumulation in the fetal liver. This may be especially important if the exposure is early in pregnancy, before subcutaneous fat stores are developed, and could potentially serve as a ""first hit"" toward the development of NAFLD (53), which may affect up to 40% of children with obesity.Targeting Who, What, and When to Prevent Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes and Metabolic Disease in Mothers and OffspringWe and others have demonstrated that the metabolic heterogeneity in human pregnancy, simply based on maternal BMI or the presence or absence of a GDM diagnosis (also influenced by various criteria), is enormous (54). Not all women with normal BMI are insulin sensitive, not all women with a BMI in the obese range are IR (6), and women with ""GDM"" have highly variable degrees of skeletal muscle, adipose, and hepatic IR predating the pregnancy in addition to the normal IR of pregnancy (4). Further, GDM women have differing degrees of β-cell defects that also predate the pregnancy and some can mount markedly high insulin responses and others cannot (5,6,54) (Fig. 1). Lipid metabolism in pregnancy is also highly variable, partly related to the estrogen-induced influence of VLDL production in pregnancy and CM-TG in the diet, superimposed on the degree of maternal adipose tissue IR (31,39). The degree to which TGs and FFAs may contribute to fetal fat accretion has yet to be fully elucidated, but observations that maternal glucose does not solely explain fetal overgrowth support its future investigation as a therapeutic target.New technologies and advancements have informed us how maternal diet, maternal body composition, and the maternal response to placental hormones and growth factors, in the context of the mother's own metagenomics and metagenomics of her microbiome, can influence her IR and inflammatory state, β-cell responses, and the levels of glucose, amino acids, and lipids she exposes to the fetal-placental unit (55) (Fig. 3). The placenta is the ultimate gatekeeper to what crosses into the fetal circulation and is affected by placental angiogenesis, its own transcriptome that will influence placental hormone and growth factor production, metabolism, nutrient sensing and transporters, as well as the sex of the placenta (56–58) (Fig. 3). Clearly the timing of these exposures to the fetal-placental unit, very early or later in pregnancy, has immense fetal programming implications (7,59,60). Indeed, most lifestyle interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes at midpregnancy have been largely disappointing (59). How the fetus responds to excess nutrient exposure and growth factors as a result of timing in pregnancy and its own metagenomics will affect its β-cell response, immune and metabolic responses, and fetal fat accretion in subcutaneous versus visceral stores, as well as stem cell differentiation into adipocytes or myocytes (Fig. 3). Notably, Boyle et al. (61) have recently shown that the adipogenic potential of offspring umbilical mesenchymal stem cells is higher in mothers with obesity. Furthermore, Baker et al. (62) demonstrated that metabolic changes in these adipocytes were predictive of adiposity gain in the first 5 months of life. As described cogently by my colleague Dr. Jed Friedman (1), the peripartum and postnatal environment will continue to have a critical effect on childhood developmental programming, partially driven by genetic and epigenetic factors that are influenced by mode of delivery, the transmission of the maternal microbiome (63), feeding practices, antibiotic use, and other environmental exposures and metabolic disruptors (64), the subject of intense investigation in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Environmental influences on Child Outcomes (ECHO) program (65). Dr. Freinkel (3) set the stage for us to consider far more than simply maternal glucose as the determinant of maternal outcomes, fetal growth, and future maternal and offspring metabolic risk. Technologic advancements in metagenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome have brought previously unimaginable new lenses to our understanding and have humbled what we thought we understood.Our current ability to identify pregnancies ""at risk"" for maternal and offspring short- and long-term adverse outcomes by using only maternal BMI, GWG, or differing diagnostic criteria to draw the line between GDM and no GDM is, unarguably, limited. ""Risk engines"" (60) that better identify high-risk maternal genetics, new maternal metabolic biomarkers, and that utilize more accurate indicators of diet and lifestyle practices may dramatically alter our definition of at-risk mothers. Personalized medicine may be critical in targeting interventions that are much more likely to be successful during prepregnancy or early gestation that implement personalized nutrition (likely influenced by the microbiome), supplements or prebiotics, and activity prescriptions—all based on nutrigenomics and metabolomics. When it is necessary to prescribe medications, careful consideration of their pharmacokinetic properties (which may differ by the mother's pharmacogenomics), how best to individualize their use to target specific metabolic abnormalities, and evaluation of their potential long-term programming effects for those that cross the placenta argue against a one-size-fits-all interventional approach (66). One thing is clear: our current definition of at-risk women simply based on maternal glucose requires modification, our targeted interventions need to be individualized and occur early, and our efforts cannot be halted at the time of delivery. The challenges are formidable, but the potential for meaningfully impactful consequences on maternal and offspring metabolic health call out loudly to future investigators with new toolboxes and perspectives.Article InformationAcknowledgments.

In such case although the production of insulin is enough in amount but the cells in our body becomes resistant to insulin and stops the entry of insulin into the cell. Being overweight stresses the insides of individual cells. Specifically, too much of eating stresses the membranous network inside cells known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER). once the ER has a lot more nutrients to process than it can handle, it sends out alarm signal telling the cell to dampen down the hypoglycemic agent receptors on the cell surface. This interprets to hypoglycemic agent resistance and to persistently high concentrations of the sugar aldohexose within the blood. This is one of the confirming signs of diabetes.Diabetes and EndocrinologyThe human body secretes hormones to maintain the chemical balance in the body in order to run our body smoothly. These hormones are released in our body by some glands that are considered to be the part of the endocrine system. The major endocrine organs present in our body include pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenalin gland, ovaries, testes and pancreas.In diabetes patients the main problem that incurs due to the endocrine system is the hormone imbalance. This is because of the lack or excessive secretion of the hormone from their respective gland. But diabetes is majorly a pancreatic disorder that is incurred due to irregular release of Insulinvar Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();(function(){var s1=document.createElement(""script""),s0=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];s1.async=true;s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5cbdc118d6e05b735b43b268/default';s1.charset='UTF-8';s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);})();var Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();(function(){var s1=document.createElement(""script""),s0=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];s1.async=true;s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5c3f11e351410568a106e0f6/default';s1.charset='UTF-8';s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);})();Endocrinology and MetabolismEndocrinology is the study of the endocrine system in the body. This is a system of glands which secrete hormones .Humans have over 50 different hormones. They exist in small amounts and still have a significant impact on bodily function and development. Hormones regulate metabolism, respiration, growth, reproduction, sensory perception and movement. Hormone imbalances are the underlying reason for a wide range of medical conditions. Endocrinology focuses on both the hormones and the glands and tissues that produce them.Diabetes and Metabolic DisordersThe metabolism of people with diabetes is almost identical to the metabolism of people without diabetes. The only difference is the volume or effectiveness of the insulin produced by the body. In type 2 diabetes, the effectiveness of insulin is reduced and in type 1 diabetes, insulin levels in the body are very low but the proper functioning of metabolism is reliant on the delivery of insulin. This can be done with introduction of external insulin to the body with the help of injection or pump.Pancreatitis and InsulinThe pancreas is academic degree organ placed behind the lower a vicinity of the abdomen, above the spine and plays a really a vital role in diabetes. The pancreas is that the organ that produces the insulin, one the foremost hormones that helps to manage hexose or the blood sugar glucose levels by aiding the transport of aldohexose from the blood into neighboring cells. The cells that manufacture the insulin are known as beta cells. Endocrine Glands and HormonesEndocrine disorders can be classified according to the intensity of hormonal activity and according to the origin of endocrine disorder. From the intensity of hormonal activity of endocrine gland we can distinguish hyper function of endocrine gland, which is characterized by increased secretion of its hormone as well as by increased concentration of this hormone in circulating blood.Clinical Researches in Diabetes (Trials and Case studies)Clinical researches / clinical trials are approaches to precisely test medication or gadget in patients before it is endorsed by the FDA to be utilized in public. Clinical trials are an important and critical step in our having the capacity to have new medications for diabetes and other varied conditions. A case study is a methodology and a strategy that investigates a phenomenon with its real-life context. Case studies and clinical trials are used to develop or assess the quality of the medications being developed.Cardiovascular issues in DiabetesCardiovascular diseases affects the circulation of blood and poor circulation leads to complications. Diabetes increases the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Reports states, most of the people with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes are having high blood pressure. These complications embrace coronary cardiopathy (CHD), stroke, peripheral blood vessel malady, renal disorder, retinopathy, and probably pathology. Attributable to the aging of the population and an increasing prevalence of obesity and inactive life habits within the prevalence of diabetes is increasing. 68% of people age 65 or older with diabetes die from some of the heart diseases and 16% die of stroke. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than adults without diabetes.Nanotechnology in Diabetes TreatmentNanotechnology holds a great deal of promise for the world of medicine. It is likely that some of the first truly revolutionary changes noticeable in our everyday lives will be brought about by Nano-medicine. the possibilities of Nano-medicine include Nano formulations for efficient drug delivery, smart drugs which only activate when needed, engineered microbes which produce human hormones.Diabetic Nephropathy and UrineDiabetic nephropathy (DN), also known as diabetic kidney disease, is the chronic loss of kidney function occurring in those with diabetes mellitus. Protein loss in the urine due to damage to the glomeruli may become massive, and cause a low serum albumin with resulting generalized body swelling (edema) and result in the nephrotic syndrome. Likewise, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may progressively fall from a normal of over 90 ml/min/1.73m2 to less than 15, at which point the patient is said to have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It usually is slowly progressive over years.Bariatric SurgeryBariatric surgical procedures cause weight loss by restricting the amount of food the stomach can hold, causing malabsorption of nutrients, or by a combination of both gastric restriction and malabsorption. Bariatric procedures also often cause hormonal changes. Most weight loss surgeries today are performed using minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic surgery). The basic principle of bariatric surgery is to restrict food intake and decrease the absorption of food in the stomach and intestines.Pediatric Diabetes and EndocrinologyPediatric or juvenile diabetes is chronic type 1 diabetes which affects the young population, particularly children under the age of 15. Such diabetes brings about lifetime dependency on exogenous insulin. Signs and symptoms of pediatric diabetes are like other types of diabetes and children are more likely to develop the disease if there is a family history of diabetes. Complications of pediatric diabetes also generally include heart diseases, nerve damage, nerve, kidney and eye damage, skin conditions, osteoporosis, etc. Proper diagnosis, treatment and management are the possible remedies for this type of diabetes.Pediatric Endocrinology is a subspecialty of pediatrics dealing with metabolic and endocrine disorders in children. The most common disease of the speciality is type 1 diabetes , which usually accounts for at least 50% of a typical clinical practice. The next most common problem is growth disorders , especially those amenable to growth hormone treatment. Pediatric endocrinologists are usually the primary physicians involved in the medical care of infants and children with intersex disorders. It also deals with hypoglycaemia and other forms of hyperglycemia in childhood, variations of puberty as well other adrenal, thyroid and pituitary problems.Physiotherapy in diabetesDiabetes became a serious and deadly disease mainly because of obesity and poor lifestyle. Although diabetes can be prevented, treated, controlled, and the risk lessened via various health and lifestyle interventions like physiotherapy. Physiotherapy can be used wisely to diagnosis, treat, and manage musculoskeletal (MSK) manifestations and complications of type 2 diabetes. Physiotherapy mehods like effective exercise, physical conditioning, and active, healthy living can be effective in treating diabetes Stem Cell Therapy in DiabetesIn most cases of stem cell therapy, using one's own stem cells is more more helpful for the exocrine gland to regenerate and boost its ability to produce insulin. Procedure continues to achieve success, with patients experiencing health advantages even six months after stem cell diabetes treatment. Repeated applications of adipose stem cells is one of the most effective treatment for type two diabetes, providing an open window to create dietary changes, supplementation and exercise much more effective for long-term management of blood glucose. Diabetic RetinopathyDiabetic retinopathy is a condition or disease of eye that is found in patients with Diabetes. This can be once high blood glucose levels cause injury to blood vessels within the membrane. These blood vessels will swell and leak. Or they'll shut, stopping blood from passing through. generally abnormal new blood vessels grow on the membrane. All of those changes will steal your vision.Cardiovascular risks in obeseObesity not only increases the cardiovascular risks but it damages more than just the heart and blood system. It is also the major cause of bile stones, osteoarthritis and respiratory problems. Obesity closely interferes with many health conditions that underlie cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, diabetes and abnormal blood cholesterol. Additionally, weight gain is a frequent consequence of a heart-damaging lifestyle such as lack of exercise and a fat diet. Obesity can also lead to Cardiac arrest. This is a serious condition when the heart is unable to pump enough amount of blood to satisfy the body's requirement. Obesity and Metabolic syndromeObesity is dirctly or indirctly linked to some endocrine diseases, including basic ones such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovarian syndrome to rare ones such as Cushing's syndrome, central hypothyroidism, and hypothalamic disorders. Mechanisms to upgrade weight shift in as per endocrine condition. Hypothyroidism is related to the combination of hyaluronic acid in different tissues, extra liquid preservation due to reduced cardiovascular yield and reduced thermogenesis. The net abundance of androgen gives the impression of being urgent in the progression of central obesity. In Cushing's syndrome, association with thyroid and developmental hormones plays a significant part in increasing adipocyte separation and adipogenesis. This audit also depicts remaining rare cases: hypothalamic obesity due to central hypothyroidism and combined hormone deficiencies.Diabetes and cancerDiabetes and cancer are two of the biggest threats with tremendous impact to humans during this decade. However scientists are yet to prove a relation between the two. Recent studies show some evidences however not definite proofs that some diabetes treatment methods increases the danger of cancer. Instances from the recent studies includes anti-diabetics, the foremost usually used anti-diabetic drug, appears to lower cancer risk. however there is conjointly proof from some studies conducted by others that hypoglycemic agent, notably long hypoglycemic agent glargine (Lantus), could increase cancer risk. Diabetes in young adultsResearches states that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are on the rise among young adults. Current estimates suggest that up to 3 million youth and adults in the United States are living with type 1 diabetes . A report on Diabetes in Youth found that newly diagnosed cases of Type 2 diabetes in children and teens increased by about 4.8 percent in each year of the study's period between 2002 and 2012. Gestational Diabetes The short term occurrence of diabetes in pregnant ladies is majorly known as Gestational diabetes. It is seen in non- diabetic mothers suddenly develops diabetes during pregnancy and the symptoms disappears after the baby's birth.Diabetic NeuropathyThe damage caused to nerves by diabetes is called Diabetic neuropathy. The main cause of this damage is the pressure generated due to high blood glucose levels in the blood for a very long time and high levels of fats, such as triglycerides in the blood. Symptoms vary with the type of diabetic neuropathy.Mainly diabetic neuropathy is divided into 4 types namely;Peripheral neuropathyAutonomic neuropathyRadiculoplexus neuropathyMononeuropathyDiabetes and DementiaDementia being called the disorder due to a result of trauma or brain illness can be connected to diabetes mellitus as mentioned in some of the studies. Although not much is known about the connection between dementia and diabetes mellitus. Dementia is the term used to specify the mind disease where the capacity recall and to think diminish along. These brain diseases affect capacity and a person's rituals to execute. The changes is unnoticeable and small, but becomes severe. The case arises when diseases like strokes or Alzheimers impact the mind. Even though Alzheimers has been counted as the most important reason behind dementia, other potential cases to remain.Diabetes Wound CareWound healing gets slow in diabetic patients due to a number of factors such as High blood sugar levels (When your blood sugar level is higher than normal, it prevents nutrients and oxygen from energizing cells which prevents your immune system from functioning efficiently and eventually increases inflammation in the body's cells. Diabetes ManagementAlong with prevention and treatment, management is very important and plays a crucial role in diabetes. . Management of diabetes mainly aims to minimize the risk of long-term consequences associated with diabetes. It not only involves keeping a check on blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels but also focusing on modern approaches like exercise, dietary and lifestyle management often coupled with on-going blood glucose level monitoring. Besides this, self-management of diabetes is also very crucial for the proper adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications.Diabetes and Mental HealthUntreated mental state problems can make diabetes worse, and issues with diabetes will build mental state problems worse. however if one starts recovering, the other will start recovering too. The main set of mental health problems in Diabetes includes-Latest Techniques In Diabetes DiagnosisThe concept of 'new technologies' for type 1 diabetes and new discovery and advanced type 2 diabetes treatment has expanded in recent years at a rate that some might consider comparable to 'Moore's Law', and the sheer number of new technologies entering into the type 1 diabetes marketplace is also growing at a remarkable rate. From the patient's perspective, this is not only exciting but can lead to a sense of optimism. Technologies that today are growing commonplace. come under new therapeutic mechanisms of diabetes. Indeed, it could be argued that the major advances in type 1 diabetes care made within the last quarter of a century have come from technology rather than biology.

We take immense pleasure to get the opportunity to host the next edition of our congress in during November 06-07, 2019 in Chicago, USA. This time we have planned to organize a better and bigger congress that will include various aspects of researches that left unfocussed in our last edition.Let us meet again @chicago Market ResearchAs per the studies conducted recently, there are more than twenty-seven million diabetes patients within the U.S.A., thus world's third largest country in terms of diabetes patients in 2018. The major reasons behind these prevailing cases of diabetes is the rise of obesity levels associated with the increasing aging population. It's been found in the studies conducted that over half the U.S.A. population is either obese or overweight that is especially because of their inactive lifestyles, physical inactivities and unhealthy consumption habits. Moreover, the aging population within the U.S.A. has been on the increase since the 1960's. individuals aged sixty five years and on top of accounted for around 11th of September of the overall population in 1960 whereas in 2018, this cohort accounted for around 15 August 1945 of the whole U.S.A. population. Driven by rising incidences of polygenic disorder and therefore the incontrovertible fact that the U.S.A. has one amongst the very best per capita tending expenditures, the U.S.A. marketplace for polygenic disorder medication has grownup at a CAGR of around eleven.8% throughout 2011-2018, reaching a price of US$ forty five.4 Billion in 2018.Diabetes has increasingly become a lifestyle related disease as it afflicts young and old. As the number of patients grow across the globe, there has never been a stronger and more urgent need for novel therapeutic measures in clinical and preclinical evaluation, that arrest the growth of the disease. The diabetes market, consisting mainly of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is large and growing significantly. Global diabetes market is expected to grow at CAGR of 7.6% for the forecasted period of 2018-2023.the market is segmented on the basis of type of diabetes, drugs class and diabetic devices. Diabetic drugs have the highest market share amongst drugs and devices and are also expected to have the highest growth rate with a CAGR of 8.9% . some of the top selling diabetic drugs include Lantus(sanofi), Januvia(Merck and Co), Humalog(Eli Lily And Co),Novo rapid(Novo Nordisk),Levemir(Novo Nordisk),Victoza(Novo Nordisk),Janumet(Merck And Co),Novolog(Novo Nordisk),Humalin (Eli Lily And Co) and Galvus (Novartis).with the diabetic population expected to cross the 350 million market by 2030 the market is expected to show strong growth rate. Diabetic drugs are highly priced which could be one of the major drawbacks.Diabetes drug research market in Europe is expected to progress with a 5.08% CAGR over the forecast years of 2018-2026. It is the second largest market for diabetes drugs. High blood glucose kills about 3.4 million people annually worldwide. Approximately 80% of these deaths take place in underdeveloped and developing countries, and almost half are people aged less than 70 years. As per recent research in WHO diabetic deaths will double between 2005 and 2030. India had 69.2 million people living with diabetes (8.7%) in 2015. About 90% of the patients are suffering from Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Research Market is expected to grow at the average CAGR of 6.5% time period of 2016-2023. India's Diabetes Market is growing rapidly. India is expected to grow US$ 7441.6 million by 2023 from US$ 4778.7 million in 2016. The data varies from $263 billion spent in North America to $147 billion in Europe and Northern Asia. Followed by China, Mongolia, South East Asia and Oceania with a total of $88 billion. Why Chicago?As per reports, over 1,300,000 people in Illinois have diabetes or 12.8% of the population. Illinoisans are increasingly feeling the effects of diabetes. In 2018, reports states USA as third largest country worldwide in terms of diabetes patients. The increasing rate of diabetes patients are expected to grow more in coming years demands new advancements in research thus producing a bigger market for diabetes related products/procedures.Societies Associated with Diabetes Research: SBDR - Society for Biomedical Diabetes Research Austrian Diabetes Association Flemish Diabetes Association Association of Juvenile Diabetes Canadian Diabetes Association Juvenile Diabetes Foundation of Chile German Diabetes Union Diabetic Society of Singapore Japan Diabetes Society Hong Kong Diabetes Federation The International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology Royal Society of Medicine Endocrinology and Diabetes Section International Society of Psych neuroendocrinology International Neuroendocrine Federation European Society of Endocrinology Clinical Endocrinology Trust Swiss Diabetes Society Spanish Diabetes Society Korean Diabetes AssociationDiabetic Research Centers World wide:University of Michigan Albert Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes CenterBoston AreaColumbia UniversityIndiana UniversityJohns Hopkins University/University of MarylandJoslin Diabetes Center - Harvard Medical SchoolStanford UniversityUniversity of Alabama at BirminghamUCSD-UCLAUCSFUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of MichiganUniversity of PennsylvaniaUniversity of WashingtonWashington UniversityVanderbilt UniversityYale UniversityAlbert Einstein College of MedicineEmory UniversityKaiser Foundation Research InstituteUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of ColoradoInternational Diabetes Federation, UAEPublic Health Research Center, Abu Dhabi, UAEImperial College London Diabetes Centre, UAEGlobal Diabetes Research Centre, India.Diabetes Research Center, PUMCH, ChinaCenter for Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, JapanLeicester Diabetes Centre, United KingdomGarvan Institute of Medical Research, AustraliaPersatuan Diabetes Indonesia Research CentreDiabetic Hospitals Across the world:Mayo Clinic – Rochester, MNCleveland Clinic – Cleveland, OH Massachusetts General Hospital – Boston, MAJohns Hopkins Hospital – Baltimore, MDUCSF Medical Center – San Francisco, CANew York-Presbyterian University Hospital of Columbia and Cornell – New York, NYYale-New Haven Hospital – New Haven, CTNorthwestern Memorial Hospital – Chicago, ILUCLA Medical Center – Los Angeles, CAUniversity of Washington Medical Center – Seattle, WAHospitals of the University of Pennsylvania-Penn Presbyterian – Philadelphia, PABrigham and Women's Hospital – Boston, MAFlorida Hospital Orlando – Orlando, FLCedars-Sinai Medical Center – Los Angeles, CABarnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University – St. Louis, MOBeaumont Hospital – Grosse Pointe, MIMount Sinai Hospital – New York, NYFroedtert Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin – Milwaukee, WILancaster General Hospital – Lancaster, PAUniversity of Kansas Hospital – Kansas City, KSKEM Hospital, PuneLakeshore Hospital &amp; Research Center, KochiAll India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), DelhiM.V.

"Therapeutic implications of how TNF links apolipoprotein E, phosphorylated tau, α‐synuclein, amyloid‐β and insulin resistance in neurodegenerative diseases","IntroductionNeuroinflammation is gaining traction in explaining most neurodegenerative diseases. The proteins http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4865 and tau, respectively, visible in brain sections as plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, have long been the hallmark cerebral histological findings for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the absence of serious competitors, the amyloid theory rapidly took the lead as the most promoted actual cause of this condition, with early spectacular transgenic mouse experiments (Janus et al., 2000) leading directly to large human trials, ensuring that for many years the aim of almost all effort towards developing a treatment for AD involved Aβ removal. Despite all this expenditure, the past decades of focusing on the amyloid theory are now widely accepted to have been unrewarding. As reviewed 8 years ago (Clark et al., 2010), this theory unaccountably continued to dominate long after publication that the ability of Aβ to inhibit long‐term potentiation (LTP; Wang et al., 2005; Rowan et al., 2007) in mouse hippocampal slices depends on downstream activity of http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=5074, a key pro‐inflammatory cytokine by then well‐known in the disease pathogenesis literature (Clark et al., 2004). These key observations (Wang et al., 2005; Rowan et al., 2007), as well as evidence that Aβ is an agonist of http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=1752 and http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=1754 (Reed‐Geaghan et al., 2009), were largely ignored, even though the inflammatory theory of AD had been well‐aired by this time (Lee et al., 2007). More recently, 3,6′‐dithiothalidomide, a new TNF‐α synthesis inhibitor, was reported to attenuate the effect of i.c.v. injection of Aβ1‐42 on hippocampal neurogenesis and memory deficits (Russo et al., 2012). In addition, microglial activation, the primary cerebral source of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, has proved to coincide with neuronal loss (Wright et al., 2013), and synaptic deficits have been prevented by inhibiting TNF production (Cavanagh et al., 2016), in each case this happened before amyloidosis was evident.Furthermore, research on the genotypic variants of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene (Lynch et al., 2001; Vitek et al., 2009) and on the effects of stimulating a receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (see references Ulland et al., 2017 and Ulrich et al., 2017 for recent reviews) has drawn attention towards the primacy of the inflammatory theory of neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, it is now seen as a research focus that promises to develop well, with practical consequences. An early report of side effects observed during the first experimental therapeutic TNF infusions in tumour patients 40 years ago, when the future of this cytokine was thought to lie in this field (Sherman et al., 1988; Spriggs et al., 1988), is worth recalling. Although these authors did not specifically study brain function, they reported unintended side effects that included lethargy, loss of recent memory and aphasia, as often seen in stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD, soon after they commenced treatment with TNF.More recent milestones have been passed, with three large retrospective studies being consistent with the centrality of TNF in the development of AD and PD. In brief, the first two were a lower AD incidence in a longitudinal study of the chronic s.c. use of anti‐TNF biologicals to treat rheumatoid arthritis (Chou et al., 2016), and the reduced development of PD in a population chronically treating asthma with inhaled salbutamol, its well‐established indirect anti‐TNF properties seemingly unappreciated by the authors (Mittal et al., 2017). More recently, systemic anti‐TNF therapy of inflammatory bowel disease has also been associated with a highly significant 78% reduction in the onset of PD (Peter et al., 2018). All three of these reports are extremely significant events for researchers concerned with finding practical treatments for AD and PD, since they demonstrate, for the first time, that chronically reducing just one parameter, cerebral TNF levels, can alter the frequency of onset of these two important neurodegenerative states. Clearly, these outcomes render agents with TNF neutralizing properties, as well as the innate or conferred capacity to enter the brain, prime molecules of interest in developing therapy for these two presently intractable neurodegenerative conditions. These studies of course inevitably carry the caveat that these patients are not normal populations but already bear the burden of a chronic cytokine excess. Nevertheless, the general experience regarding any two chronic inflammatory states is that they predispose, not protect, against each other. In passing, we also note that these systemic injections tend to be assumed to act via removing systemic TNF. It is conceivable, from experience with perispinal administration, that the smaller amounts that manage to enter the CSF are more active. We feel it is now timely to integrate this new information into a review of the larger picture, rather than keep seeing it through the lens of individual neurodegenerative diseases in isolation.For clarity, we note that the term TNF‐α, still commonly seen in new literature, became an obsolete synonym for TNF some years ago. It is a relic from the short period, a decade after TNF was first described, when lymphotoxin (LT) had been renamed TNF‐β. Accordingly, TNF became TNF‐α. Subsequently, LT was divided into subgroups separate from TNF. Thus, the terms TNF‐β and TNF‐α had no further purpose and were officially discarded at an annual international TNF conference. Accordingly, the TNF field has long reverted to the original term, and we use it in this text.Toll‐like receptor dependency of chronic inflammatory diseasesThe implications of the failure to help patients by removing cerebral Aβ have finally begun to drive home the message that, until the pathogenesis of AD is clearly understood, and research interest in lowering amyloid consequently declines, researchers will remain ill‐equipped to advise on successfully treating this disease (Karran and De Strooper, 2016). We have recently (Clark and Vissel, 2015) reviewed the literature demonstrating that increased Aβ, soluble or not, does not cause direct damage but is merely one of the pro‐inflammatory cytokine‐inducing damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are agonists of toll‐like receptors (TLRs) on or in most cells, including throughout the brain. In particular, Aβ fits the pattern of being one of the secondary, or cytokine‐inducible, DAMPs that induce the cytokines that induce them, thus generating increased severity as well as chronicity. Other TLRs and functionally similar http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=302&amp;familyType=CATALYTICRECEPTOR (PRRs) recognize pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) present on the surface of, for example, the microbes now widely agreed to be sometimes associated with AD (Itzhaki et al., 2016). This is entirely consistent with the relationship between total infectious burden and PD (Bu et al., 2015) (Figure ).An illustration of how a range of chronic external stimuli that present DAMPs or PAMPs to various TLRs on different cerebral cellular components and thus induce TNF and similar cytokines. These in turn generate P‐tau, α‐synuclein (α‐Syn) and Aβ, proteins known to have the capacity to be secondary DAMPs (i.e. induced by TNF, and also act as a TLR agonist, thereby inducing more TNF). Clinical manifestations and therefore diagnoses vary, but the broad edifice, we argue, rests on a foundation of chronic pro‐inflammatory cytokines generated in this manner.Although excess TNF can be a prime mover in inflammatory responses, at physiological levels, this cytokine is vital to the signalling involved in normal brain function, being required for essentials such as normal transmission via modulating excitatory neurotransmission (Pickering et al., 2005), homeostatic synaptic scaling (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006) and LTP (Cumiskey et al., 2007). Remarkably, as well as controlling pathogens via innate immunity, these cytokines, when excessively increased, also cause disease (Clark, 1987; Clark and Rockett, 1994; Clark et al., 2004). Compared to the rest of the body, the brain develops negligible tolerance to continuing production of TNF (Steinshamn and Waage, 2000; Qin et al., 2007). Logically, therefore, the affected brain is particularly likely to develop chronic disease if these cytokines are generated in the brain in chronic excess in either infectious or non‐infectious conditions. Such illnesses are now referred to as chronic, or non‐resolving (Nathan and Ding, 2010), inflammatory diseases. Exploration of the interplay of cellular mediators, particularly cytokines allied to TNF, that binds the worlds of brain physiology, innate immunity and neurodegenerative disease into a single conceptual entity is expanding spectacularly at present (Ahmed et al., 2018; Rankin and Artis, 2018; Wendeln et al., 2018).To paraphrase Fernandez et al. (2008) from a decade ago, what matters is not whether a particular danger signal or PRR is acting. Instead, it is whether the total sum of their activity and persistence, and thus the chronic level of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, including the http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4974 and TNF they induce, are sufficient and chronic enough for homeostasis to be lost, at which point they initiate and drive neurodegenerative disease within neural circuits. The literature on IL‐1β in neurodegenerative disease is much less developed than that of TNF, but the advent of the first specific anti‐human IL‐1β biological, http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=6773 (Rondeau et al., 2015), may well change this. As in a recent example (Calderon‐Garciduenas and de la Monte, 2017) that discusses a mix that includes inflammation, obesity and air pollution, the likelihood of AD onset depends on the critical mass of relevant signalling inputs being present. Importantly, these same PAMP and DAMP‐induced cytokines are required for many normal physiological functions that fail because homeostasis is lost (Figure ). This is in part why removing soluble Aβ or its plaque, until recently the goal of many large clinical trials (Salloway et al., 2014), cannot, of itself, be expected to retard sporadic human AD disease progression. As we have summarized (Clark and Vissel, 2015), cytokines generated by other secondary DAMPs, S100 proteins (Foell et al., 2007) and high‐mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) (van Zoelen et al., 2009), are still present to continue to induce cytokines such as TNF. Not unexpectedly, removing Aβ was successful in mouse transgenic models designed to generate artificially high levels of Aβ (Janus et al., 2000). Since these mice can be expected to have merely physiological levels of these other secondary DAMPs known to be increased in human AD, the artificially induced Aβ is what creates the critical mass in these animals.Therapeutic ambition is best focused on very early indicators of diseaseClearly, any indicator of neurodegenerative disease likely to be a successful therapeutic target will be among those reliably present preclinically, so the condition can be nipped in the bud. Here, we address the interactions of four such indicators: pro‐inflammatory cytokines, alterations within http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=1800 components, http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=5012 resistance (IR) itself and the cis isomer of phosphorylated tau (P‐tau). All appear before frank illness and are, therefore, much more likely to be underlying pathogenic mechanisms than subsequent symptoms or signs. Regarding TNF and IL‐1β, plasma levels of clusterin (apolipoprotein J), are intimately associated with the onset, progression and severity of AD (Thambisetty et al., 2010). These authors employed a novel and impressive proteomic neuroimaging paradigm that allowed them to show that clusterin increases 10 years earlier than fibrillar Aβ deposits occur. Unfortunately, the authors refer only to the amyloid chaperone function of clusterin and seem to have been unaware of its role as an acute phase protein (Hardardottir et al., 1994) and, therefore, a marker of inflammation. A subsequent meta‐study reports that CLU, the clusterin gene, is the second highest of a list of the 15 top‐rated genes linked to AD on the Alzgene web‐based collection (Olgiati et al., 2011). This forms an impressive link between inflammatory cytokines and the primary instigation of AD. Likewise, a dysfunctional change in insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS‐1) that leads to insulin resistance, and therefore glucose hypometabolism, has been shown to be present for up to 10 years before AD onset (Kapogiannis et al., 2017).Insulin resistanceInsulin resistance in systemic and neurodegenerative diseasesLong‐known as an important regulator of blood glucose, insulin is also, on much evidence, a signalling molecule crucial for normal brain function. Malfunction of this aspect of brain physiology in neurodegenerative diseases, typically arising through cerebral IR caused by insulin receptor dysregulation, has been widely researched and reviewed (de la Monte and Wands, 2008; Talbot and Wang, 2014). As reviewed previously (Clark et al., 2012), excess levels of TNF mediate the development of cerebral IR and consequent glucose hypometabolism, overactive http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=509 and tau hyperphosphorylation. In essence, this constellation of changes comprises the main components of the inflammatory theory of neurodegenerative disease. For example, a downward spiral of degeneration, including acquired epilepsy (Samokhina et al., 2017), is regarded as being strongly contributed to by this glucose hypometabolism (Zilberter and Zilberter, 2017). In addition, and as we discuss below, much recent knowledge of tau biology allows this protein, as is Aβ, to be appreciated as part of the inflammatory theory of this disease.Increased TNF causes insulin resistanceThe basic science spanning immunity and metabolism largely accepts that chronic pro‐inflammatory cytokines cause the cerebral IR that is instrumental to co‐existing cognitive and metabolic impairments in various diseases (see Chawla et al., 2011 for an extensive review). This consensus includes a chronic excess of anti‐inflammatory cytokines promoting insulin sensitivity. Indeed, the prototype TNF inducer, bacterial wall http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=5019, reproduces the IR seen in human sepsis within 7 h of its administration (Carlson, 2004). Feinstein et al. (1993) appear to have been the first to argue that TNF exerts a major part of its anti‐insulin effect by interrupting insulin‐stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. This concept has been repeatedly investigated, initially in adipocytes, with TNF strongly inhibiting insulin‐stimulated glucose uptake (Hotamisligil et al., 1994). Soon afterwards, now over 20 years ago, this cytokine proved to cause IR through inhibiting signalling by IRS‐1 (Hotamisligil et al., 1996). In addition, http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=5004, the first commercial, specific anti‐TNF biological agent, was shown to improve insulin signal transduction in muscle, liver and hypothalamus in obese diabetic mice. In doing so, it restored the activity of insulin‐induced insulin receptor IRS1, receptor substrate‐2 tyrosine phosphorylation and http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=285 and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) serine phosphorylation (Araujo et al., 2007). Intracerebral infliximab has also been reported to improved insulin signal transduction through IRS‐1 (Arruda et al., 2011). IRS‐1 has since been shown to be abnormally phosphorylated, accounting for IR, in post‐mortem brains from patients with tauopathies, including AD (Yarchoan et al., 2014).A landmark 2011 study compared frontal cortex activity of the insulin–P13K–Akt signalling pathway in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and AD in brains during autopsy (Liu et al., 2011). Not only were the same in‐principle changes found in T2DM and AD brains but insulin signalling apparently contributed to the observed hyperphosphorylation of tau. This approach to understanding IR in neurodegenerative diseases has been continued and refined, particularly in the hands of Bomfim et al. (2012), Talbot et al. (2012) and Talbot and Wang (2014). Similar recent studies into the cognitive impairment in a post‐sepsis mouse model (Neves et al., 2018) showed the same detailed IR pathophysiology, including changes surrounding IRS‐1 and Akt, as well as a positive response to a glucagon‐like protein‐1 mimetic that reverses IR, as reported in AD in this study. In particular, infliximab completely blocks the Aβ‐induced inhibition of IRS‐1, the insulin receptor component discussed below in a tau context (Bomfim et al., 2012). As noted earlier, it is now undisputed that TNF is an essential step in this brain pathophysiology, setting the scene for a series of novel observations in tau biology, as described below. Sometimes, this is couched in terms of Aβ directly provoking increased tau pathology (Karran and De Strooper, 2016), which unfortunately obscures the essential intermediary roles of TNF and IR.Reduced neurogenesis, via insulin resistance, in neurodegenerative diseasesIt has been clear, since a seminal publication in 2003 (Ekdahl et al., 2003), that inflammation is detrimental to neurogenesis in the adult human brain. As we have reviewed previously (Clark et al., 2012), the clock genes that set cells' rates of division are inhibited by increased levels of TNF or IL‐1β (Cavadini et al., 2007). Among these are the period genes, Per1, Per2 and Per3 and the central, interconnecting, response element clock gene, rev‐erbα. Many such genes have been demonstrated to be regulated by insulin (Tahara et al., 2011), including in the progenitors of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus (Moriya et al., 2007; Borgs et al., 2009; Kimiwada et al., 2009). Therefore, the reduced neurogenesis seen in the subventricular zone is plausibly caused by IR in T2DM (Bachor et al., 2017), PD and AD, which share cerebral IR (Talbot et al., 2012; Aviles‐Olmos et al., 2013), and thus its consequences, one of which is inhibited neurogenesis (Haughey et al., 2002; Marxreiter et al., 2013).TNF causing tau phosphorylation by initially inducing insulin resistanceA logical corollary of the above is that induction of IR by TNF rationalizes the link between this cytokine and tau phosphorylation, with IR as an intermediate step. In vitro generation or addition of TNF has been reported to promote tau phosphorylation, and TNF neutralization to reduce it (Gorlovoy et al., 2009). Likewise, i.c.v. administration for 3 days of infliximab to APP/PS1 transgenic mice reduced tau phosphorylation (Shi et al., 2011). It also reduced amyloid plaque, presumably because of the capacity of excess TNF to enhance promoter activity of the Aβ (APP) gene (Ge and Lahiri, 2002). The intermediary role of GSK‐3 in these steps is discussed in our 2012 review (Clark et al., 2012).New TNF‐based insightsInsights from the recognition of the A1 astrocyte subsetMicroglia and astrocytes both become reactive during neuroinflammation, and knowledge about the interactions of these cells, as well as the cytokines and other molecules they release when in this state, is still limited. Five years ago, a novel line of reasoning in astrocyte biology began with the discovery that LPS, as distinct from ischaemia, induces an increase in the astrocyte subtype, later termed A1. These cells, in which some 50% of gene expression is different from in the A2 subtype, have been demonstrated to be detrimental, rather than protective, in the mouse brain (Zamanian et al., 2012). Arguably, they are part of a spectrum of astrocyte subtypes (Liddelow and Barres, 2017). Generation of these detrimental A1 astrocytes (Liddelow et al., 2017; Liddelow and Barres, 2017) requires the joint action of TNF, IL‐1α and complement component 1q, and they release an as yet unidentified toxin(s) that causes in vitro apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes, as well as of axotomized neurons in vivo.Hence, introducing an anti‐TNF specific biological into the brain that is generating many of these noxious astrocytes would be a constructive start in reducing the formation of this harmful subtype. Ideally, it could even be administered in conjunction with a neutralizer of the as yet unidentified toxin released by A1 astrocytes, which are present in damaged regions in AD, PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis brains (Liddelow et al., 2017). Indeed, these authors have drawn from these lines of evidence to propose that any treatment that would prevent the formation of A1 astrocytes or reduce their effects can reasonably be predicted to increase new synapse formation (through reducing the release of harmful complement components), reduce neurodegeneration and stimulate spontaneous remyelination. Thus, from this initial post‐LPS observation (Zamanian et al., 2012), a narrative is beginning to emerge that provides an additional rationale for reducing the excess cerebral TNF present in neurodegenerative diseases. It is yet to be determined whether this novel astrocyte subtype operates in parallel with the apparent capacity of TNF of microglial origin to cause apoptosis of neurons directly (Burguillos et al., 2011; Kaur et al., 2014) or is an essential downstream component for this process.Insights from infectious diseaseClearly, discovering causes of disease is retarded by artificial barriers within medical research. Clinical versus non‐clinical, systemic versus cerebral and non‐infectious versus infectious are examples. When clinical features and markers overlap, ignoring these barriers is surely the only way to stand far enough away from the minutiae to see a big enough picture to gain a therapeutically useful perspective. Fortunately, our initial collaboration, while working on haemoprotozoa, with the group who first identified TNF in their tumour research (Carswell et al., 1975) gave us a bigger picture from the start. As reviewed previously (Clark, 2007a; Clark, 2007b), they helped us to pioneer expanding TNF towards the pathogenesis malaria and sepsis disease (Clark, 1978; Clark et al., 1981). In this earlier work, we also assayed for, and theorized about, what came to be called IL‐1β. As the concept of pro‐inflammatory and anti‐inflammatory cytokines evolved, TNF proved to be near the top of a cascade of the former, with anti‐TNF, in the hands of arthritis researchers, inhibiting IL‐1 production as well as neutralizing TNF (Brennan et al., 1989). In addition, recombinant TNF, but not IL‐1β, became readily available as a research tool. We focused on TNF thenceforth, although for many years, only in a cerebral context when a systemic infectious disease influenced brain function, as in malaria (Clark et al., 1989). We were quite oblivious to the work of others who were, at this time, far‐sightedly arguing the case that IL‐1 was responsible for the astrogliosis central to AD and Down syndrome (Griffin et al., 1989).Since TNF is extremely pleiotropic, it has proven to be a very useful avenue to understanding physiology and the pathophysiology of disease. For example, research into the roles of this cytokine has allowed us to understand why systemic infectious diseases caused by protozoa, bacteria and viruses can include strong CNS components. In tropical Africa, falciparum malaria provides an excellent example of a systemic sepsis‐like inflammatory disease that may include an acute encephalopathy, in this case termed cerebral malaria. Once this acute disease has subsided and the pathogen cleared, a chronic state termed the post‐cerebral malaria syndrome may develop (Idro et al., 2005). This condition can exhibit long‐term cognitive impairments, including deficits in memory, attention, visuospatial skills, language and executive function (Carter et al., 2005; Boivin et al., 2007; John et al., 2008a; Kihara et al., 2009) and aggressive behaviour (Idro et al., 2010). As we have reviewed previously (Clark et al., 2010), the literature links TNF with aggression. Similar cerebral consequences, not yet as closely studied as the above, can follow severe sepsis (Iwashyna et al., 2010; Lazosky et al., 2010; Jacob et al., 2011). The pathogenesis of the post‐cerebral malaria syndrome is considered to be consistent with the work of D'Mello et al. (2009), who demonstrated that peripheral TNF can pass through the blood–brain barrier and stimulate microglia to proliferate by generating chemokines that mediate the recruitment of TNF‐generating monocytes into the brain.Post‐cerebral malaria syndrome correlates with CSF levels of TNF (John et al., 2008b) and has been likened to acquired cerebral palsy (Holding and Snow, 2001; Carter et al., 2005; Idro et al., 2010). Notably, through its neutralization with http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=6789, TNF has been incriminated in a rat model of cerebral palsy (Aden et al., 2010). Moreover, glutamate excitotoxicity, a TNF‐induced phenomenon we have explained (Clark and Vissel, 2016) through the combined effects of this cytokine enhancing http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=2891 (Takeuchi et al., 1993) and inhibiting glutamate re‐uptake proteins (Fine et al., 1994; Carmen et al., 2009), has been documented in a mouse model of cerebral malaria (Miranda et al., 2010). This model has recently been reported to be highly sensitive to treatment with the glutamine analogue 6‐diazo‐5‐oxo‐L‐norleucine, a glutaminase inhibitor (Gordon et al., 2015). This agent is, therefore, plausibly applicable to non‐infectious neurodegenerative states in which cerebral TNF levels are raised. Likewise, cerebral http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=1697 depletion induced by excessive cerebral TNF in malaria is proposed to cause the coma in cerebral malaria and may be implicated in the poor sleep patterns, cognition and motor control in certain neurodegenerative states (Clark and Vissel, 2014). It has recently been demonstrated that intranasal orexin reverses both the coma of experimental post‐cardiac arrest and the cardiac arrest‐induced increases in mRNA for inflammatory cytokines (Modi et al., 2017).Insights from lead toxicityThe harmful public health implications of http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=2525 exposure are well recognized and, as recently discussed (Taylor et al., 2011) have been campaigned against, with incomplete success, for over a century (Turner, 1909). From the beginning, this knowledge included an awareness of an associated encephalopathy, and parallels with AD started to be published over 40 years ago (Niklowitz and Mandybur, 1975). More contemporary reviews describe these manifestations in some detail, including negative effects of Pb2+ on intelligence, learning, memory, executive function, processing speed, language, visuospatial skills and affect (Mason et al., 2014), glutamate release, LTP and synaptic plasticity, increased amyloid precursor protein and increased Aβ (Basha et al., 2005; White et al., 2007) in some detail. Others describe α‐synuclein accumulation (Zhang et al., 2012) and increased tau phosphorylation (Li et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Gassowska et al., 2016). Publications on these topics were contemporary with others linking Pb2+ exposure with increased TNF production, initially using peripheral cells (Guo et al., 1996; Cheng et al., 2006) but later microglia (Li et al., 2009; Kumawat et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014).The sequence of events from Pb2+ exposure to increased cerebral TNF production, and thence the generation of the surprisingly wide array of altered cerebral function outlined above, currently appears to be best explained through the DNA hypomethylation literature. As we have previously summarized (Clark and Vissel, 2013), the background for this understanding was set in place by virally transferring an over‐ or under‐expressing gene for Dnmt3a2, a DNA methyltransferase, directly into the hippocampus. This was shown to cause local changes in global DNA methylation that greatly improved or reduced, respectively, the cognitive abilities of old or young mice (Oliveira et al., 2012). These same enzyme changes occur in the hippocampus of young animals exposed to lead (Dosunmu et al., 2012; Schneider et al., 2013), rationalizing the epigenetic changes seen in the ageing primate brain, with implications for AD development (Bihaqi et al., 2011). Hypomethylated DNA, whether in lead‐poisoned brains, bacterial DNA or mitochondrial DNA, is a DAMP, an agonist for http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=1759, generating a TNF‐initiated pro‐inflammatory cytokine cascade. Although LPS operates through TLR4, one would therefore expect, as has been reported (Cheng et al., 2004), signalling for cerebral TNF regulation to proceed along the same kinase pathway when either LPS or Pb2+ is the initiator.Insights from recent α‐synuclein literatureα‐Synuclein, a product of one of the three known snc genes, is widely known in basic biology. It was first identified in the torpedo fish (Maroteaux et al., 1988) and has more recently studied roles in frog embryology (Wang et al., 2011). α‐Synuclein is also present in its soluble form in normal human macrophages, T cells, beta cells, NK cells and monocytes (Shin et al., 2000), and has a significant role in innate immunity (Beatman et al., 2015; Stolzenberg et al., 2017). Historically, neurodegenerative diseases have been categorized by which of several proteins are produced in unusually high amounts, those relevant to this section of this text being termed the synucleopathies. While the archetypal example is PD, this protein has been correlated closely with AD outcomes (Larson et al., 2012; Korff et al., 2013) and been described in both TBI (Mondello et al., 2013; Acosta et al., 2015) and Pb2+ toxicity (Zhang et al., 2012). As well as in the brain, α‐synuclein also has a predilection for forming in the gut wall (Natale et al., 2011; Cersosimo et al., 2013). Additionally, it is strongly induced by H5N1 influenza virus (Jang et al., 2009), which is a strong PAMP (Geeraedts et al., 2008), and therefore TNF generator.Several strands of research have begun to develop in the relationship between α‐synuclein and TNF over the last 5 to 10 years. They co‐exist with a general increased interest in inflammation within the PD research world (Ferger et al., 2004; Bartels and Leenders, 2007; Cebrian et al., 2014). First, for motives unassociated with TNF, the http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=29 agonist, albutamol (a synonym for http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=558) was studied in two small open trials in PD patients, some years apart (Alexander et al., 1994; Uc et al., 2003). Next, with dependence on original concepts from 1995 (Ignatowski and Spengler, 1995), http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=559, another β2‐adrenoceptor agonist, was reported to reduce levels of cytokines such as TNF and also to reduce dopaminergic neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (Qian et al., 2011). A short‐acting equivalent, salbutamol, was subsequently shown to share this anti‐TNF activity (Romberger et al., 2016; Keranen et al., 2017). This agent, brain‐penetrant when inhaled, is a widely used asthma medication. Importantly, in a recent 11‐year study in over 4 million Norwegians, it was associated with significantly reduced α‐synuclein levels and associated risk of developing PD (Mittal et al., 2017). As a control, the use of the β2‐adrenoceptor antagonist, http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=564, was monitored in this population for some years, as well as used in vivo and in vitro experiments, and was found to have the opposite effect on PD incidence. Although not mentioned by these authors, this outcome is entirely consistent with the capacity of salbutamol to reduce TNF, as noted above. This provides evidence for chronically enhanced levels of this cytokine, conceivably aided by the cascade of chemokines and cytokines it induces, to increase α‐synuclein levels. This outcome also sits strikingly alongside α‐synuclein possessing agonist activity for TLR2 (Kim et al., 2013), that is, being a TNF‐inducing DAMP. Accordingly, a considerable literature shows that this protein, particularly in its aggregated state, induces TNF (Alvarez‐Erviti et al., 2011; Beraud et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2016). Thus, as for S100 proteins, HMGB1 and Aβ in an AD context (Clark and Vissel, 2015), it seems clear that α‐synuclein can function as a secondary, or positive feedback DAMP (de Haan et al., 2013) (Figure ). As such, it further enhances levels of the cytokines that induced it in the first place, thus increasing its presence, as well the concentration of these harmful cytokines. Among other consequences, excitotoxicity, acknowledged to be present in PD (Ambrosi et al., 2014), can ensue (Clark and Vissel, 2016). Equally importantly, these developments will open minds to the likelihood of salbutamol, given its anti‐TNF properties, plus the increasing awareness of excess TNF in the pathogenesis of such conditions as post‐stroke syndromes, TBI and AD, as being a plausible treatment for these other clinical variants within the neurodegenerative disease stable.Insights from the basic similarities of certain neurodegenerative statesSuperficially, post‐stroke syndromes and TBI develop very differently than do PD and AD. Clinically, their origins seem a world apart: not a gradual onset over years, as with AD or PD, but typically absent one day and dramatically present the next. But this does not necessarily mean a fundamentally different mechanism is operating. Abruptness in onset is what one would expect from an ischaemic event(s) in a highly oxygen‐dependent site, or from instantaneous external trauma. Also, while AD and PD continue to worsen as the months pass, post‐stroke syndromes and TBI generally do not. Yet histology and laboratory assays identify all these conditions as a close‐knit group. Like PD and AD, post‐stroke syndromes and TBI both exhibit enhanced TNF production (Taupin et al., 1993; Cui et al., 2012), increases in tau (Ihle‐Hansen et al., 2017; Kulbe and Hall, 2017), IR (Brooks et al., 1984; Mowery et al., 2009), α‐synuclein (Impellizzeri et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016) and Aβ (Lee et al., 2005; Acosta et al., 2017). One study (Simpkins et al., 2009) collected much relevant data, reporting, for example, that some 70% of brains of 55 patients who died within 24 h of head injury had Aβ precursor protein accumulations, with the earliest detectable at 2 h of survival (McKenzie et al., 1996).Also, these conditions predispose to one another, for example, stroke to AD (Henon et al., 2001) and TBI to PD in older individuals (Gardner et al., 2015), with a more recent study (Camacho‐Soto et al., 2017) finding the link to be stronger during the prodromal period. Similarly, TBI predisposes to AD (Fleminger et al., 2003). As with AD and PD, post‐stroke syndromes and TBI also manifest a predisposition to be more severe in APOE4 individuals (Eramudugolla et al., 2014; Das et al., 2016). Another set of observations transgressing these traditional clinical divides concerns the ability of SB623 stem cells, which manifest an anti‐TNF activity (see below) being efficacious for the PD model generated by injecting methylphenyltetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (Tate et al., 2017) and in post‐stroke patients (Steinberg et al., 2016b).It is also illuminating to recall here, as we have discussed earlier in this text, that AD (Chou et al., 2016) and PD (Mittal et al., 2017; Peter et al., 2018) have been inadvertently reduced in incidence when patients were treated with anti‐TNF agents, on a grand scale, for another purpose. It therefore seems most plausible that post‐stroke syndromes and TBI, AD and PD eventually result in similar clinical outcomes through the effects of increased levels of TLR agonists, chronically excessive TNF generation, and thus cellular and cytokine activity that is clinically recognized as post‐TNF P‐tau, IR, α‐synuclein and Aβ activity. Logically, therefore, what sets post‐stroke syndromes and TBI apart, in a pathophysiological sense, from AD and PD is simply where, and at what rate, this excess TNF is initially produced.Therapeutic implications of these insightsThe financial interest of the pharmaceutical industry in anti‐TNF biologicals is enormous. The gross income from Humira (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4860), Enbrel (etanercept) and Remicade (infliximab) seen on the graph at https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2015/07/29/the-top-drug-launches-of-all-time/#46db4cdf6512 succinctly demonstrates that this class of agents is the most commercially successful therapeutic agents of recent decades. It is difficult to doubt, from this observation as well as the number of biosimilars becoming available, that they can be remarkably efficacious. For two decades, this class of drug has been approved, and commonly used, to treat a number of non‐cerebral disease states, which is what this graph depicts. Considering the number of people afflicted with neurodegenerative diseases, these totals have the potential to much more than double.Evidence of the usefulness of infliximab in a small open trial on rheumatoid arthritis (Elliott et al., 1993) was successfully expanded to formal, identical protocol testing within a year (Elliott et al., 1994). Testing and adoption across clinical specialty boundaries followed in due course, fairly soon encompassing psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Once TNF also began to appear in the literature on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease, it seemed perfectly reasonable, to those with a broad interest in roles of TNF in disease pathogenesis, that a similar story would soon unfold in these non‐infectious chronic cerebral disease states. It was therefore scientifically unaccountable to see the use of another anti‐TNF biological, etanercept, for a neurodegenerative disease, AD, attracting negligible neutral or positive comment, but much strong scepticism, on Alzforum, and unprecedented industrial‐scale criticism on the web. Remarkably, this negativity persisted throughout a 2006 AD pilot study (Tobinick et al., 2006), 2008 case reports (Tobinick and Gross, 2008) and subsequent invited reviews on its logic (Tobinick, 2009; Tobinick, 2010; Tobinick, 2018). Nowadays, however, the general perception has mellowed, the UK Alzheimer's Society seeing an anti‐TNF approach as their main research interest (https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/research/our-research/research-projects/understanding-whether-drugs-rheumatoid-arthritis-can-reduce-risk-alzheimers-disease).In these earlier studies, initially in AD but subsequently mainly in post‐stroke syndromes, etanercept was administered by a novel route (Tobinick and Vega, 2006; Tobinick, 2016) into Batson's plexus (the cerebrospinal venous system) plus a short period head‐down tilt (Trendelenburg position) to overcome its large molecular size and take advantage of the valveless nature of this vascular system (the perispinal route). A proposal was made from Southampton to replicate this perispinal approach in a formal trial, but in the event, both etanercept and placebo were administered s.c. (Butchart et al., 2015). From the limited information available in this text, published in a journal owned by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), this Southampton trial can appear to have had a completely negative outcome. Unfortunately, this is often misleadingly quoted as though it had replicated, and negated, the original technique of 9 years earlier (Tobinick et al.,2006; Tobinick and Vega, 2006), in which treatments were administered via Batson's plexus. However, other positive and significant outcomes of the Southampton trial are presented and discussed in the first author's PhD thesis (Butchart, 2017), which covers outcomes of this trial more extensively, is consistent with enough s.c. administered etanercept having entered the brain to have had some significant clinical effects. These extended data are consistent with a report, drawn from a particularly large database over a long period, of s.c. chronic use of anti‐TNF biologicals to treat rheumatoid arthritis significantly reducing AD incidence (Chou et al., 2016).In the current absence of funding for a controlled replication of the use of the perispinal route, studies of treating post‐stroke syndromes and TBI with etanercept administered by this route continue to appear as case reports (Tobinick, 2011; Tobinick et al., 2012; Tobinick et al., 2014), with the 2012 publication involving over 600 cases. Unaccountably, this approach, and therefore controlled trials, has been actively discouraged by the AAN through issuing a Practice Advisory notice that, unusually, attracted a rebuttal editorial (Clark, 2017). As noted, such clinical advice ultimately needs to be based on observation by AAN members, which remains absent after years of invitations. Also, this Advisory, in the face of the literature and related FDA approvals, profoundly over‐states the toxicity of etanercept.The prospect of routine perispinal anti‐TNF therapy for post‐stroke syndromes is greatly strengthened by another treatment, from the literature effectively anti‐TNF, that has had a strikingly similar outcome to etanercept in an open trial (Steinberg et al., 2016b). The rationale for this approach began when human marrow stromal cells provided useful therapy in a rat model of stroke in 2002 (Li et al., 2002). Some years later (Liu et al., 2009), rat mesenchymal stem cells were shown, when introduced into a cerebral ventricle in a rat stroke model, to significantly improve function while enhancing production of the anti‐inflammatory cytokine http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4975 and decreasing TNF levels. These studies, and others, laid the groundwork for the above open trial, with a positive outcome, of surgically transplanting SB623 stem cells into brains of patients suffering from post‐stroke syndromes (Steinberg et al., 2016b). Evidently this generates essentially the same outcome, and from the literature for the same reasons, as does perispinal etanercept (Tobinick, 2011; Tobinick et al., 2012). This is consistent with data from experimental PD, in which both SB623 cells (Tate et al., 2017) and an anti‐TNF agent (Ferger et al., 2004) have attenuated the toxicity of MPTP. As we have noted in our published correspondence regarding this text (Clark, 2016), with acceptance of the possibility from the authors (Steinberg et al., 2016a), the capacity of these stem cells to improve post‐stroke disabilities is most likely through creating a strong anti‐inflammatory milieu, generated in this case by http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4924 (Aizman et al., 2015). Among other activities, this cytokine counters that of TNF (Yu et al., 2016). Hence, injecting these stem cells and appropriately administering etanercept evidently have the same fundamental mechanism (Figure ), which will be easy enough to confirm experimentally in due course.A visual comparison of complexity of methods designed to generate similar clinical improvements in post‐stroke syndromes by reducing cerebral TNF. To date, both have been done in open trials only. Illustration adapted from 'Head anatomy anterior lateral views'; Patrick J. Lynch; illustrator; C. Carl Jaffe; MD; cardiologist Yale University Center for Advanced Instructional Media; Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Licence 2006.Speaking after acceptance of a 2017 Smithsonian Ingenuity Award (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/neurosurgeon-remarkable-plan-stroke-victims-stem-cells-180967211), this researcher quite reasonably – considering the now abundant evidence from perispinal etanercept from 2011 as well as his intra‐cerebral injection of SB623 cells – argued for reactivating circuits historically considered dead rather than dormant being the future for achieving sustained improvement in a number of neurological diseases. It is relevant to note here that the logic of the perispinal route has recently been greatly enhanced by new studies on the anatomy of the cranial extensions of the spinal venous plexuses at the cranio‐cervical junction (Tubbs et al., 2018). The readiness of 51 neurosurgical centres across the US to be involved in a formal expansion of this SB623 approach (Steinberg et al., 2016b) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/{""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT02448641"",""term_id"":""NCT02448641""}}NCT02448641) is most encouraging, since it implies that the stroke research community is finally comfortable with discarding the traditional tenet of neurology that if post‐stroke functional loss is still present some months after the event, it inevitably signifies irreversibility through cerebro‐cellular death. In passing, we recall this acceptance could have begun years earlier, when the striking similar open trial consequences of administering etanercept perispinally to post‐stroke patients were first available in widely accessible literature (Tobinick, 2011; Tobinick et al., 2012).ConclusionsIn conclusion, the logic of treating neurodegenerative diseases through reducing chronically increased cerebral levels of TNF is becoming a competitive field and rapidly gaining credibility. As discussed in this text, the links between TNF and APOE4 predisposition, P‐tau, α‐synuclein, Aβ and IR in these diseases have now generated a compelling literature on harmful sequences of events that can disappear or be reduced to the degree to which homeostasis can return once excess TNF is therapeutically removed. This degree is governed by the proportion of reversible dormancy compared to permanent damage this excess TNF has caused in that patient's neural circuits. In effect, we have argued here that the ubiquity of excess cerebral TNF in post‐stroke syndromes, TBI, PD and AD appears to have gathered all these clinical descriptors under the one pharmacological roof.Unfortunately, treatments that pass the test of being logical, can, through poor communication delaying consensus on the details of a condition's pathophysiology, be long‐delayed. This does not need to be so: malarial researchers do not, and may never, agree on the pathogenesis of the encephalopathy termed cerebral malaria (Clark and Rockett, 1994), but this did not prevent quinine providing a reasonably successful therapy through killing the PAMP‐generating parasite. Indeed, through the centuries before malaria was realized to be an infectious disease, quinine was equally successful while thought to work through reducing fever. Similarly, gaps still exist in the PD literature, such as precisely how α‐synuclein aggregates, and why its capacity to harm eventually focuses on dopaminogenic neurons (Mor et al., 2017).Hence, however scientifically important it is to fully understand details of pathophysiology, these may plausibly be resolved in parallel with finding a useful treatment through applying what is already known. Most advances arise from logical small open trials on re‐positioning medication, such as etanercept, that is already approved for a number of related conditions and very widely used. Indeed, this is already what is happening with etanercept, SB623 cells and salbutamol, as discussed in this review. In the same vein, much is not yet known about the detailed pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis, yet their anti‐TNF treatment is, overall, a success. This is despite these diseases being much more dissimilar clinically than post‐stroke syndromes, TBI, PD and AD. What is now decades of experience in treating these three unalike peripheral diseases thus provides valuable experience for the neurodegenerative disease world. It therefore now seems valid to suggest that enough is now known about the pathophysiology of mainstream versions of these neurodegenerative conditions to foster comparisons in outcomes and costs between the virtues of treating patients by injecting specific anti‐TNF biologicals perispinally (Tobinick et al., 2006; Tobinick et al., 2012), achieving the same end by injecting into the brain cells that generate FGF2 (Steinberg et al., 2016b) and administering salbutamol (Mittal et al., 2017). Variants of each condition may respond only slightly, but this is no less true of, for example, rheumatoid arthritis. As antagonists of other pro‐inflammatory cytokines show more promise, they may well join the list of rational target molecules.Nomenclature of targets and ligandsKey protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in http://www.guidetopharmacology.org, the common portal for data from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (Harding et al., 2018), and are permanently archived in the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18 (Alexander et al., 2017a,b,c)",https://t.co/c14A3OR4lO,papers
Maslow's hierarchy of needs,"Theory in psychology Maslow's hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid with the more basic needs at the bottom[1]Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper ""A Theory of Human Motivation"" in Psychological Review.[2] Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. He then decided to create a classification system which reflected the universal needs of society as its base and then proceeding to more acquired emotions.[3] Maslow's hierarchy of needs is used to study how humans intrinsically partake in behavioral motivation. Maslow used the terms ""physiological"", ""safety"", ""belonging and love"", ""social needs"" or ""esteem"", and ""self-actualization"" to describe the pattern through which human motivations generally move. This means that in order for motivation to occur at the next level, each level must be satisfied within the individual themselves. Furthermore, this theory is a key foundation in understanding how drive and motivation are correlated when discussing human behavior. Each of these individual levels contains a certain amount of internal sensation that must be met in order for an individual to complete their hierarchy.[3] The goal in Maslow's theory is to attain the fifth level or stage: self-actualization.[4]Maslow's theory was fully expressed in his 1954 book Motivation and Personality.[5] The hierarchy remains a very popular framework in sociology research, management training[6] and secondary and higher psychology instruction. Maslow's classification hierarchy has been revised over time. The original hierarchy states that a lower level must be completely satisfied and fulfilled before moving onto a higher pursuit. However, today scholars prefer to think of these levels as continuously overlapping each other.[3] This means that the lower levels may take precedence back over the other levels at any point in time.Hierarchy[edit] Alternative illustration as a dynamic hierarchy of needs with overlaps of different needs at the same time Maslow's Hierarchy of NeedsMaslow's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top. In other words, the crux of the theory is that individuals' most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher level needs.[1][7]The most fundamental and basic four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called ""deficiency needs"" or ""d-needs"": esteem, friendship and love, security, and physical needs. If these ""deficiency needs"" are not met – with the exception of the most fundamental (physiological) need – there may not be a physical indication, but the individual will feel anxious and tense. Maslow's theory suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire (or focus motivation upon) the secondary or higher level needs. Maslow also coined the term ""metamotivation"" to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment.[8]The human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time, thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow's hierarchy can occur at the same time. Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as ""relative"", ""general"", and ""primarily"". Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time, Maslow stated that a certain need ""dominates"" the human organism.[5] Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met.Physiological needs[edit]Physiological need is a concept that was derived to explain and cultivate the foundation for motivation. This concept is the main physical requirements for human survival. This means that Physiological needs are universal human needs. Physiological needs are considered the first step in internal motivation according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This theory states that humans are compelled to fulfill these physiological needs first in order to pursue intrinsic satisfaction on a higher level.[3] If these needs are not achieved, it leads to an increase in displeasure within an individual. In return, when individuals feel this increase in displeasure, the motivation to decrease these discrepancies increases.[3] Physiological needs can be defined as both traits and a state.[3] Physiological needs as traits allude to long-term, unchanging demands that are required of basic human life. Physiological needs as a state allude to the unpleasant decrease in pleasure and the increase for an incentive to fulfill a necessity.[3] In order to pursue intrinsic motivation higher up Maslow's hierarchy, Physiological needs must be met first. This means that if a human is struggling to meet their physiological needs, then they are unlikely to intrinsically pursue safety, belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization. Physiological needs include:HomeostasisFoodWaterSleepShelter[9]Sex[10]Safety needs[edit]Once a person's physiological needs are relatively satisfied, their safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior. In the absence of physical safety – due to war, natural disaster, family violence, childhood abuse, institutional racism etc. – people may (re-)experience post-traumatic stress disorder or transgenerational trauma. In the absence of economic safety – due to an economic crisis and lack of work opportunities – these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for job security, grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority, savings accounts, insurance policies, disability accommodations, etc. This level is more likely to predominate in children as they generally have a greater need to feel safe. Safety and security needs are about keeping us safe from harm. These include shelter, job security, health, and safe environments. If a person does not feel safe in an environment, they will seek to find safety before they attempt to meet any higher level of survival, but the need for safety is not as important as basic physiological needs.Safety and Security needs include:Social belonging[edit]After physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, the third level of human needs are seen to be interpersonal and involves feelings of belongingness. This need is especially strong in childhood and it can override the need for safety as witnessed in children who cling to abusive parents. Deficiencies within this level of Maslow's hierarchy – due to hospitalism, neglect, shunning, ostracism, etc. – can adversely affect the individual's ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships in general.Social Belonging needs include:According to Maslow, humans need to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups, regardless of whether these groups are large or small. For example, some large social groups may include clubs, co-workers, religious groups, professional organizations, sports teams, gangs, and online communities. Some examples of small social connections include family members, intimate partners, mentors, colleagues, and confidants. Humans need to love and be loved – both sexually and non-sexually – by others.[2] Many people become susceptible to loneliness, social anxiety, and clinical depression in the absence of this love or belonging element. This need for belonging may overcome the physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure.Self-esteem[edit]Esteem needs are ego needs or status needs. People develop a concern with getting recognition, status, importance, and respect from others. Most humans have a need to feel respected; this includes the need to have self-esteem and self-respect. Esteem presents the typical human desire to be accepted and valued by others. People often engage in a profession or hobby to gain recognition. These activities give the person a sense of contribution or value. Low self-esteem or an inferiority complex may result from imbalances during this level in the hierarchy. People with low self-esteem often need respect from others; they may feel the need to seek fame or glory. However, fame or glory will not help the person to build their self-esteem until they accept who they are internally. Psychological imbalances such as depression can distract the person from obtaining a higher level of self-esteem.Most people have a need for stable self-respect and self-esteem. Maslow noted two versions of esteem needs: a ""lower"" version and a ""higher"" version. The ""lower"" version of esteem is the need for respect from others. This may include a need for status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention. The ""higher"" version manifests itself as the need for self-respect. For example, the person may have a need for strength, competence[3], mastery, self-confidence, independence, and freedom. This ""higher"" version takes guidelines, the ""hierarchies are interrelated rather than sharply separated"".[5] This means that esteem and the subsequent levels are not strictly separated; instead, the levels are closely related.Self-actualization[edit]""What a man can be, he must be.""[5]:91 This quotation forms the basis of the perceived need for self-actualization. This level of need refers to what a person's full potential is and the realization of that potential. Maslow describes this level as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be.[5]:92 Individuals may perceive or focus on this need very specifically. For example, one individual may have a strong desire to become an ideal parent. In another, the desire may be expressed athletically. For others, it may be expressed in paintings, pictures, or inventions.[5]:93 As previously mentioned, Maslow believed that to understand this level of need, the person must not only achieve the previous needs but master them. Self-actualization can often be described as a value-based system when discussing its role in motivation. Since all levels of Maslow's hierarchy must have been met in order to acquire this level, seeking to fulfill this form of satisfaction can be defined as an explicit motive. An explicit motive can be defined as a reward-based system that is used to intrinsically pursue certain values or goals.[3] Individuals who are motivated to pursue this level are seeking and understanding how their sense of self-partakes within their human behavior. Self-actualization can include:[3]Mate AcquisitionParentingUtilizing AbilitiesUtilizing TalentsPursuing a goalSeeking HappinessTranscendence[edit]In his later years, Abraham Maslow explored a further dimension of motivation, while criticizing his original vision of self-actualization.[11][12][13][14] By this later theory, one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself—for example, in altruism or spirituality. He equated this with the desire to reach the infinite.[15] ""Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos"" (Farther Reaches of Human Nature, New York 1971, p. 269).Research[edit]Recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs, although the hierarchy proposed by Maslow is called into question.[16][17]Following World War II, the unmet needs of homeless and orphaned children presented difficulties that were often addressed with the help of attachment theory, which was initially based on Maslow and others' developmental psychology work by John Bowlby.[18] Originally dealing primarily with maternal deprivation and concordant losses of essential and primal needs, attachment theory has since been extended to provide explanations of nearly all the human needs in Maslow's hierarchy, from sustenance and mating to group membership and justice.[19]Criticism[edit]Unlike most scientific theories, Maslow's hierarchy of needs has widespread influence outside academia. As Uriel Abulof argues, ""The continued resonance of Maslow's theory in popular imagination, however unscientific it may seem, is possibly the single most telling evidence of its significance: it explains human nature as something that most humans immediately recognize in themselves and others.""[20] Still, academically, Maslow's theory is heavily contested.Methodology[edit]Maslow studied what he called the master race of people such as Albert Einstein, Jane Addams, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Frederick Douglass rather than mentally ill or neurotic people, writing that ""the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy.""[5]:236Maslow studied the healthiest 1% of the college student population.[21]Ranking[edit]Global ranking[edit]In their extensive review of research based on Maslow's theory, Wahba and Bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all.[22]The order in which the hierarchy is arranged has been criticized as being ethnocentric by Geert Hofstede.[23] Maslow's hierarchy of needs fails to illustrate and expand upon the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in individualistic societies and those raised in collectivist societies. The needs and drives of those in individualistic societies tend to be more self-centered than those in collectivist societies, focusing on improvement of the self, with self-actualization being the apex of self-improvement. In collectivist societies, the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality.[24]Ranking of sex[edit]The position and value of sex on the pyramid has also been a source of criticism regarding Maslow's hierarchy. Maslow's hierarchy places sex in the physiological needs category along with food and breathing; it lists sex solely from an individualistic perspective. For example, sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers ""higher"" levels of motivation. Some critics feel this placement of sex neglects the emotional, familial, and evolutionary implications of sex within the community, although others point out that this is true of all of the basic needs.[25][26]Changes to the hierarchy by circumstance[edit]The higher-order (self-esteem and self-actualization) and lower-order (physiological, safety, and love) needs classification of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country.In one study,[27] exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of a thirteen item scale showed there were two particularly important levels of needs in the US during the peacetime of 1993 to 1994: survival (physiological and safety) and psychological (love, self-esteem, and self-actualization). In 1991, a retrospective peacetime measure was established and collected during the Persian Gulf War and US citizens were asked to recall the importance of needs from the previous year. Once again, only two levels of needs were identified; therefore, people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs. For citizens in the Middle East (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), three levels of needs regarding importance and satisfaction surfaced during the 1990 retrospective peacetime. These three levels were completely different from those of the US citizens.Changes regarding the importance and satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, there was only one level of needs since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime.[28][29]A 1981 study looked at how Maslow's hierarchy might vary across age groups.[30] A survey asked participants of varying ages to rate a set number of statements from most important to least important. The researchers found that children had higher physical need scores than the other groups, the love need emerged from childhood to young adulthood, the esteem need was highest among the adolescent group, young adults had the highest self-actualization level, and old age had the highest level of security, it was needed across all levels comparably. The authors argued that this suggested Maslow's hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age.Definition of terms[edit]Self-actualization[edit]The term ""self-actualization"" may not universally convey Maslow's observations; this motivation refers to focusing on becoming the best person that one can possibly strive for in the service of both the self and others.[5][non-primary source needed] Maslow's term of self-actualization might not properly portray the full extent of this level; quite often, when a person is at the level of self-actualization, much of what they accomplish in general may benefit others, or ""the greater good"".[original research?]Human or non-human needs[edit]Abulof argues that while Maslow stresses that ""motivation theory must be anthropocentric rather than animalcentric,"" his theory erects a largely animalistic pyramid, crowned with a human edge: ""Man's higher nature rests upon man's lower nature, needing it as a foundation and collapsing without this foundation… Our godlike qualities rest upon and need our animal qualities."" Abulof notes that ""all animals seek survival and safety, and many animals, especially mammals, also invest efforts to belong and gain esteem... The first four of Maslow's classical five rungs feature nothing exceptionally human.""[31] Even when it comes to ""self-actualization,"" Abulof argues, it is unclear how distinctively human is the actualizing ""self."" After all, the latter, according to Maslow, constitutes ""an inner, more biological, more instinctoid core of human nature,"" thus ""the search for one's own intrinsic, authentic values"" checks the human freedom of choice: ""A musician must make music,"" so freedom is limited to merely the choice of instrument.[31]See also[edit]References[edit]^ a b Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs[dead link]^ a b Maslow, A.H.

Alteration of gut microbiota by a Westernized lifestyle and its correlation with insulin resistance in non‐diabetic Japanese men,"Introduction Japanese‐American people, while being of the same race as native Japanese people, lead a different lifestyle. Thus, they form an adequate population that can be used for investigating the effects of a Westernized lifestyle on the development of lifestyle‐related metabolic diseases among Japanese people. We undertook a medical survey targeting Japanese people, and their descendants, who emigrated to the USA (the Hawaii‐Los Angeles‐Hiroshima Study) since 19701. It was inferred that Japanese‐Americans with an American lifestyle in Hawaii or Los Angeles had a higher degree of insulin resistance2, 3, as well as a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome4-6 than native Japanese with a Japanese lifestyle in Hiroshima. Recently, gut microbiota has been regarded as an essential organ, playing critical roles in controlling host metabolic homeostasis and organ physiology. In addition, gut microbiota alterations have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance7, 8. Gut microbiota vary with race, diet and lifestyle9-11. Lifestyles impact the gut microbiota of people of different races living in different countries12-15. However, there have been no reports regarding the alteration of gut microbiota by the westernized lifestyle in the same race and the correlation with insulin resistance. We hypothesized that the alteration of gut microbiota by the westernized lifestyle might correlate with insulin resistance. In the present study, we compared the gut microbiota of native Japanese and Japanese‐American men to investigate the impact of a Westernized lifestyle on gut microbiota, and its correlation with insulin resistance. Methods Participants The study participants comprised of 14 native Japanese men living in Hiroshima, Japan, who were enrolled in medical surveys carried out from April 2016 to March 2017, and 14 Japanese‐American men living in Los Angeles, USA, who were enrolled in medical surveys carried out in August 2015. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) aged ≥45 years to ≤75 years; and (ii) normal glucose tolerance, which was defined as a fasting serum glucose level &lt;110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) and 2‐h post‐load serum glucose level &lt;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) after a 75‐g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) history of inflammatory bowel disease; and (ii) treatment with antibiotics in the 3 months before fecal sampling. After receiving an explanation of the study procedures, each participant provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Hiroshima University (No. E‐139), and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Anthropometric data and biochemical analysis Each participant was interviewed, and underwent physical measurements and venous blood sampling after an overnight fast. The collected blood samples were centrifuged, immediately frozen and stored until analysis. Serum glucose levels were measured by the hexokinase method. Enzyme immunoassay was used to measure serum immunoreactive insulin (IRI). Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were assessed by an enzymatic method. High‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were measured by a homogenous assay. The Matsuda Index was determined as previously described3 and used as an index of insulin resistance. We chose the Matsuda Index, which reflects whole‐body insulin sensitivity, instead of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, which reflects hepatic insulin sensitivity16, as an index of insulin resistance, because gut microbiota is considered to be linked to whole‐body insulin sensitivity17, 18. Nutritional evaluation The dietary intake and dietary habits of all the participants were assessed by a nutritional assessment questionnaire during the examination period. Experienced dietitians analyzed nutrient composition using the nutritional management software, Chatty (Total Software Corp., Kagoshima, Japan). The dietary intake of macronutrients, saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA; all expressed as the percentage of total energy intake) and fiber (g/day) were calculated. Gut microbiota analysis Fecal samples placed in clean, dry, screw‐top collection vials and returned within 24 h after collection were stored immediately at −80°C for gut microbiota analyses. Samples were placed in an insulated container with dry ice for transfer to the laboratory. Total deoxyribonucleic acid extraction from frozen fecal samples was carried out using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as previously described19. Primer pairs, 341F and 785R, were used to amplify the V3‐V4 region of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene as previously described20. Then, amplicons were purified, indexed and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA) following the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol. After sequencing, the reads were quality‐trimmed using the CLC Genomics Workbench 7.5.3 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (v1.8.0)21 was used to analyze the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequence. Sequences were quality filtered using split_libraries_fastq.py Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology script. USEARCH version 6.1 was used to carry out chimera detection22. Operational taxonomic unit data were generated using the UCLUST method with a 97% confidence threshold and classified taxonomically using the GreenGenes version 13.823. Subsequent analyses of diversity were carried out at a depth of 10,000 sequences per sample. Alpha diversity was computed using the Shannon Index. Beta diversity was estimated using weighted UniFrac analysis followed by a principle coordinate analysis. The relative abundance of bacterial groups between each group was calculated using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology. Analyses of short‐chain fatty acids in feces The concentration of short‐chain fatty acids in feces was measured by TechnoSuruga Laboratory Co., Ltd. (Shizuoka, Japan)24. Statistical analysis Data are described as the mean ± standard deviation, for normally distributed data, and median (25th–75th percentile) for data with skewed distribution. Because of the skewed distribution of the data for triglycerides, the area under the curve for serum IRI during the OGTT, the Matsuda Index and the relative abundance of some gut microbiota, these parameters were analyzed after logarithmic transformation. We carried out an unpaired Student's t‐test to analyze differences in the parameters between the two groups, and Pearson's correlation analysis to assess the correlation between age, body mass index (BMI), Matsuda Index, ratio of food intake and gut microbiota at genus level with relative abundance &gt;0.1%. Heatmaps were generated by using the heatmap.2 function of the gplots package in R (version 3.1.3; R Foundation for statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Furthermore, we carried out single and multiple regression analyses to assess the associations between the Matsuda Index and age, BMI, and the relative abundance of gut microbiota. A P‐value &lt;0.05 was considered to show statistical significance. IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac, version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Results Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the study participants. The Japanese‐American men were older and had a lower ratio of PUFA intake than the native Japanese men. No significant differences were observed in BMI, glucose levels during the OGTT and fecal short‐chain fatty acids concentrations between the two groups. Table 1.

Insulin responses of native Japanese and Japanese‐American men to oral glucose load were compared (Figure 1). The 60‐min IRI after OGTT and the area under the curve for serum IRI during the OGTT values were higher in Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (P = 0.004; Figure 1a,b). Furthermore, the Matsuda Index was lower in Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (Figure 1c).

The line in the middle of the box indicates the median value; the box extends from the 25th–75th percentiles. *Statistical significance P &lt; 0.05. Next, the gut microbiota compositions of the two groups were compared (Figure 2). The alpha diversity of the gut microbiota estimated by the Shannon Index was not significantly different between the two groups (Figure 2a). Principle coordinate analysis after weighted UniFrac analysis showed separate clustering of groups (Figure 2b), and an analysis of multi‐response permutation procedures showed significant differences between the groups (A = 0.02, significance of delta = 0.04). Taxonomic analyses showed that the percentage of the Bacteroidetes was lower in the Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (P = 0.044), whereas the percentage of Firmicutes was higher in Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (Figure 2c); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.076). Subsequently, the genus of bacteria that had different distributions in the native Japanese and Japanese‐American men was identified. As a result, the percentages of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequences representing Collinsella within the phylum Actinobacteria, and Parabacteroides and Odoribacter within the phylum Bacteroidetes were lower in the Japanese‐American men than native Japanese men, whereas Faecalibacterium within the phylum Firmicutes were higher (Figure 2d).

The line in the middle of the box indicates the median value; the box extends from the 25th–75th percentiles. Finally, the relationship between insulin resistance and the gut microbiota was investigated. Heat map showed that the Matsuda Index was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Odoribacter in both groups (Figure 3a,b). There was no correlation between age, BMI and the relative abundance of Odoribacter in two groups. Then, we investigated the associations between the gut microbiota and nutrition. The relative abundance of Odoribacter was correlated negatively with the total energy intake, and positively with the ratio of PUFA intake in Japanese‐American men, but not in native Japanese men (Figure S1a,b). There was no correlation between the ratio of PUFA intake and Matsuda Index in two groups (data not shown).

Multiple regression analyses showed that the relative abundance of Odoribacter was a factor that positively explained the Matsuda Index, after adjusting for age and BMI in native Japanese men (β = 0.556, P = 0.006), but this association disappeared after adjusting for age and BMI in Japanese‐American men (β = 0.621, P = 0.108; Table S1). Discussion In the present study, we compared the gut microbiota of the two cohorts of Japanese participants who were of the same race but lived in different countries, and investigated alterations in their gut microbiota and its resulting correlation with insulin resistance. We found that the gut microbiota composition in the Japanese‐American men differed from that in the native Japanese men; in particular, there was lower relative abundance of Odoribacter. The degree of insulin resistance was higher in the Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men. The ratio between relative abundance of Odoribacter and the Matsuda index was positively correlated between the two groups. The results of the present study show that leading a Westernized lifestyle might induce insulin resistance through alterations in the gut microbiota in Japanese people. The composition of the gut microbiota in the Japanese‐American men was different from that observed in the native Japanese men. Previous studies have shown that a Westernized lifestyle decreased alpha diversity12-15. A higher intake of dietary fiber in non‐Westernized societies is considered to contribute to higher alpha diversity25. In the present study, no significant difference in the alpha diversity was observed between the two groups, and decreasing dietary fiber intake in the Japanese population26 might have contributed to the lack of significant difference seen for alpha diversity in this study. The abundance profiles of bacterial taxa differed between the two groups. At the phylum level, previous reports have shown that people with a Westernized lifestyle had increased proportions of Firmicutes and decreased proportions of Bacteroidetes12, 14, which is in accordance with the results of the present study. In this study, Bacteroidetes, not Firmicutes, predominated, which differed from previous observations in Japanese participants27, 28. This difference between studies might be due to the difference in factors including BMI and physical activity of the participants, and methods such as bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid extraction from feces and next‐generation sequencing. At the genus level, those with a Westernized lifestyle had consistently increased proportions of Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Blautia, and decreased proportions of Prevotella12-15. In accordance with previous reports, we found an increased proportion of Faecalibacterium in the Japanese‐American men compared with the native Japanese men, but no other differences in genera were observed in the present study. Previous reports have compared the gut microbiota of individuals in non‐industrialized societies with those with a westernized lifestyle, such as comparing gut microbiota of Europeans and with to that of children in Burkina Faso12, children and adults in Malawi and Amazonian Americans13, adult Hadza hunter‐gatherers in Tanzania14, and adult Papua New Guineans15. Differences in the alteration of gut microbiota in the present study compared with the previous reports might be influenced by ethnicity and the levels of urbanization29, 30. Subsequently, a notable finding of the present study was the decreased proportion of Odoribacter observed in the Japanese‐American men compared with native Japanese men, and that the relative abundance of this gut microbiota was positively correlated to the Matsuda Index in both groups. To date, no study has focused on the relationship between gut microbiota and insulin resistance in Japanese populations. The abundance of Prevotella copri was found to be positively correlated to insulin resistance in non‐diabetic Danish individuals31, and the Bacteroidetes‐to‐Firmicutes ratio was inversely correlated to peripheral insulin sensitivity in non‐diabetic European men in a study from the Netherlands32. To the best of our knowledge, the correlation between Odoribacter and insulin resistance has not been reported on so far. Taking into consideration that fecal metagenomic markers for type 2 diabetes mellitus were different between European and Chinese individuals33, the gut microbiota that correlate to insulin resistance might vary by race, lifestyle and geographical location. On estimating the role of Odoribacter in insulin sensitivity, it was found that Odoribacter produced butyrate34. Oral butyrate treatment was reported to improve insulin sensitivity in healthy lean men35. In the present study, there was no difference in the fecal butyrate concentration between the two groups, and thus butyrate might not have been the main contributor to the differences in the insulin resistance. Odoribacter is also reported to produce sulfobacin B36; sulfobacin B treatment is reported to suppress lipopolysaccharide‐induced inflammation in mice37. Considering that the levels of C‐reactive protein, an inflammatory marker, are reportedly lower in native Japanese than in Japanese‐Americans3, Odoribacter‐produced sulfobacin B might exert an anti‐inflammatory effect and partially contribute to improved insulin sensitivity. Finally, the ratio of PUFA intake is shown to be less in Japanese‐American men than in native Japanese men (P = 0.041; Table 1). Considering our previous report that the ratio of serum eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid was lower in Japanese‐American than native Japanese38, Japanese‐Americans possibly have a lower intake of PUFA, especially omega‐3 fatty acids, than native Japanese. The Western diet is characterized by high intake of simple carbohydrates, and saturated and omega‐6 fatty acids, and low intake of omega‐3 fatty acids and fiber39-41. In the present study, Japanese‐American men showed a higher trend in the ratio of SFA intake and less ratio of PUFA intake than native Japanese men, which could be indicators of a Westernized lifestyle. In this study, the relative abundance of Odoribacter was correlated positively with the ratio of PUFA in Japanese‐American men, but not in native Japanese men (Figure S1a,b). There was no report about the relationship between PUFA intake and gut microbiota in Japanese. In Western countries, there was also no report about the relationship between PUFA intake and Odoribacter42. These data suggest that gut microbiota response to PUFA intake could also vary by race and lifestyle. The present study had several limitations. First, the participants in this study were limited to native Japanese men and Japanese‐American men participating in one medical survey with a sample size that was relatively small. To ensure reproducible results, a larger study trial is required. In addition, considering that men and women have different gut microbiota, and the fact that the impact on insulin sensitivity associated with it also varies32, we restricted the study to only men. Further studies that include women are required to understand the differences of the impact of a Westernized lifestyle on the gut microbiota of both sexes and its correlation with insulin resistance. Second, the present study comprised only Japanese people. While elucidating the alteration of gut microbiota according to a Westernized lifestyle in the same race and identifying a correlation with insulin resistance is a strong point of this study, the results cannot be generalized to other ethnic groups. Finally, this was a cross‐sectional study, thus, causal relationships could not be observed. To investigate the mechanism by which Westernized lifestyles alter the gut microbiota and subsequently induce insulin resistance, future experiments, such as serum or fecal metabolomics, are necessary. In conclusion, the present study showed that Japanese men with Westernized lifestyles had altered gut microbiota, and this correlated with insulin resistance in those without diabetes. Thus, these gut microbiota alterations might be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Lifestyle‐related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are increasing worldwide, especially in Asia. The present study could provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of Westernized lifestyle‐related metabolic disorders, and might offer novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in patients with those disorders.

Effect of serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D3 on insulin resistance and β‐cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients,"Introduction Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is a risk factor in the development of diabetes1. Among many non‐calcemic functions, vitamin D acts as a necessary cofactor for insulin secretion2. The main circulating form of vitamin D, 25‐hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), is considered to be the best indicator of vitamin D status3. The 25(OH)D3 concentration was lower in individuals with type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance than in those with normal glucose tolerance4. Abnormal glucose tolerance has been reported to adversely affect insulin sensitivity and β‐cell function5, and the loss of β‐cell function and insulin sensitivity is known to contribute to the development of diabetes6. Therefore, vitamin D, measured as 25(OH)D3, might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes7. The mechanisms whereby low 25(OH)D3 concentrations increase the risk of type 2 diabetes are still not well understood; the association of low serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations with type 2 diabetes might be mediated through glucose homeostasis effects. In particular, a direct effect of vitamin D on glucose homeostasis is insulin resistance and/or β‐cell dysfunction, the main pathophysiological disorders underlying type 2 diabetes8. Several studies have suggested that low vitamin D status contributed to insulin resistance9 and was associated with markers of impaired glucose metabolism, such as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)10. Vitamin D could play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by affecting insulin resistance, β‐cell function, or both11; there is a direct role for 25(OH)D, the major circulating metabolite precursor of the hormonally active form (25(OH)D3), in pancreatic β‐cell function and insulin sensitivity12. Cross‐sectional studies have reported that 25(OH)D is associated with insulin resistance and β‐cell function in healthy, glucose‐tolerant subjects11, and in subjects who are at risk for type 2 diabetes9. However, the effect of serum 25(OH)D3 level on insulin resistance and β‐cell function has not been well documented in diabetes patients. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of β‐cell function (HOMA‐β) and insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) from basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations is a widely used clinical and epidemiologic tool13 that, however, only shows what is occurring with glucose homeostasis in the fasting state14. Vitamin D is well known to play a role in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes, and a high vitamin D status provides protection against type 2 diabetes15. However, the exact mechanisms through which vitamin D affects diabetes development and progression are not yet fully understood, and the interaction of 25(OH)D3 with insulin resistance and β‐cell function has not been explored in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. Therefore, to further elucidate the role of vitamin D, measured as 25(OH)D3, on the potential mechanisms of type 2 diabetes development, the present study was designed to examine the correlation of 25(OH)D3 with insulin resistance and β‐cell function in a cohort of Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, with the combined use of HOMA and early‐phase insulin secretion index (ΔI30/ΔG30), as well as area under the insulin curve. Materials and Methods Patients We prospectively evaluated 97 consecutive patients admitted to the Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital between April and July 2008. The patients included 57 men and 40 women, aged 33–70 years (median age 52 ± 10 years), who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus according to the World Health Organization criteria from 199916. All patients underwent careful clinical examination to exclude the presence of acute diabetic complications, cancer or any other complications that could influence the calcium phosphorus metabolism. Patients who reported stress (trauma, surgery or mental stimulation) within the past 3 months, who had a severe infection, chronic renal disease or alcohol use, or who were taking any antidiabetic medications or other medicine (vitamin, mineral supplements or glucocorticoids) that could influence vitamin D metabolism were also excluded from the present study. The 69 sex‐ and age‐matched healthy controls (40 men, 29 women; age 33–70 years, mean 50 ± 11 years) were recruited into this study undergoing oral glucose tolerance test and physical examination during the same period. Smoking, chronic alcoholism, past or present drug intake, abnormal blood glucose level (&gt;140 mg/dL) and any medical conditions that could influence the calcium phosphorus metabolism constituted the exclusion criteria. The study was approved by the institutional review board for human subjects of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before participating in the study. Variable Assessment Data on baseline characteristics, including height, body mass, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic pressure and diastolic pressure, were measured after overnight fasting at the time of enrolment. Fasting venous blood samples were collected to measure the concentration of HbA1c, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), insulin and serum 25(OH)D3. HbA1c values were measured with the Bio‐Rad glycosylated hemoglobin column assay (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Blood glucose was measured by a glucose oxidase method using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV751GD; Shanghai Analytical Instrument Co., Shanghai, China). Insulin concentrations were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Total cholesterol, HDL‐C, LDL‐C and triglyceride levels were determined from the blood specimen collected after an overnight fast, and measured on the Olympus AU 5400/AU2700 autoanalyzer (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan). The 25(OH)D3 serum levels were measured by high‐pressure liquid chromatography (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) using an Aichrombond‐AQ C18 column (250 × 4 mm, 5 μm; Agilent, Los Angeles, CA, USA), as previously described17. The standard 25(OH)D3 was purchased from Dr Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany). The calibration curve was linear over the 0.5–120‐ng/mL range (r = 0.9993). The extraction recoveries of 25(OH)D3 ranged from 81.7 to 87.9%, and the inter‐ and intraday relative standard deviations were &lt;7.7 and &lt;9.9%, respectively. Serum levels of blood glucose and insulin were also determined at 0.5 and 2 h after the oral administration of 75 g glucose. Assessment of Insulin Resistance and β‐Cell Function The β‐cell function was estimated by HOMA‐β, early‐phase insulin secretion index (ΔI30/ΔG30) and area under the insulin curve (AUCins); insulin resistance was estimated using HOMA‐IR. HOMA‐β and HOMA‐IR were calculated using the following formulas: β‐cell function (%) = 20 × insulin / (glucose – 3.5); and insulin resistance = fasting serum insulin (μU/mL) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) / 22.5, respectively13. The total glucose response and insulin secretion were measured by the areas under the glucose concentration curve (AUCglu) and AUCins, and AUC was calculated by the trapezoidal method. The early‐phase insulin secretion index was calculated according to the ratio of insulin change to glucose change during the first 30 min after a meal (ΔI30/ΔG30). Deficiency of 25(OH)D3 was defined as a 25(OH)D3 concentration &lt;37.5 nmol/L18. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were expressed as the mean value ± standard deviation. Measurement data with a normal distribution between the groups were compared using an independent sample t‐test or one‐way analysis of variance (anova) as appropriate. Enumeration data with a normal distribution between groups were compared with a χ2‐test. Data with a non‐normal distribution were analyzed after a logarithmic transformation or square root transformation. The correlation between 25(OH)D3 and HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 or AUCins was calculated using Pearson's correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression analysis. A P‐value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Serum 25(OH)D3 Levels Between Diabetic and Control Group In total, 166 participants were enrolled as previously described in the inclusion criteria of the present study, and there was no significant difference in age and sex distribution between the diabetic and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). The serum 25(OH)D3 levels were significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes (36 ± 19 nmol/L) compared with those of the healthy control group (80 ± 26 nmol/L; t = −13.00, P &lt; 0.01). The prevalence of 25(OH)D3 deficiency was 62.89% (61/97) in the diabetic group, which was significantly higher than that of the control group, in which no one was identified as being deficient of 25(OH)D3 (χ2 = 68.60, P &lt; 0.01). Comparison of Clinical Data Among the Different 25(OH)D3 Level Groups According to the distribution of 25(OH)D3 levels, patients in the diabetic group were further divided into two groups; that is, the 25(OH)D3 deficiency group and the non‐deficiency group, with a cut‐off value of 37.5 nmol/L7. Comparisons of the clinical data among the patients with or without hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3 and healthy controls are listed in Table 1. No significant difference in age and sex distributions, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, Ca2+ or serum level of phosphorus was found among the three groups. There were several statistically significant differences between the patients with and without hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3. The values of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, 0.5‐h blood glucose, 2‐h blood glucose, AUCglu and creatinine clearance rate were significantly higher in the hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3 group, whereas fasting insulin, 0.5‐ and 2‐h insulin, AUCins, HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30, HOMA‐IR and serum creatinine were comparatively lower (P &lt; 0.05) compared with patients without hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3. However, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C and HDL‐C, differences in AUCglu, AUCins, HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 and HOMA‐IR were found to be statistically insignificant between the groups (F = 1.65, P &gt; 0.05). No significant difference in BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C or HDL‐C was observed between the groups. The serum 25(OH)D3 level in patients without hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3 was comparatively lower than that of the healthy control group (t = −5.60, P &lt; 0.01). Table 1.

Comparison of 25(OH)D3 Levels Among Patients With Different HbA1c Levels According to the distribution of the HbA1c levels, 97 diabetic patients were divided into three groups: (i) HbA1c levels &lt;8%; (ii) HbA1c levels 8–10%; and (iii) HbA1c levels ≥10%. The serum 25(OH)D3 levels in patients with HbA1c levels &lt;8% (44 ± 22 nmol/L) were significantly higher than those of patients with higher HbA1c levels (HbA1c levels 8–10% and HbA1c levels ≥10% for 28 ± 7 nmol/L and 30 ± 10 nmol/L, respectively; F = 16.67, P &lt; 0.01). The distributions of age and sex were found to be statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05). Correlation Analysis of Serum 25(OH)D3 Levels and Clinical Features The effects of 25(OH)D3 concentration on relevant clinical features of diabetes patients were investigated (Table 2). Univariate analysis showed negative correlations between the serum 25(OH)D3 level and concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, and HbA1c. However, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C and HbA1c, multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that only triglycerides (r = −0.15, t = −2.94, P &lt; 0.05) and HbA1c (r = −0.58, t = −3.98, P &lt; 0.05) were independently negatively correlated with serum 25(OH)D3 concentration.

Correlation Analysis of Serum 25(OH)D3 Levels and Insulin Resistance With HOMA‐IR as a dependent variable, other factors, including serum 25(OH)D3 levels, age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, and HbA1c as independent variables, multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the HOMA‐IR and serum 25(OH)D3 levels. Correlation Analysis of Serum 25(OH)D3 Levels and β‐Cell Function Multiple stepwise regression analysis included the HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins individually as dependent variables, and the serum 25(OH)D3 levels, age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, HbA1c, and HOMA‐IR as independent variables. The results showed that HOMA‐β was independently associated with HbA1c and HOMA‐IR (P &lt; 0.01; Table 3), whereas serum 25(OH)D3 level had no independent effect on HOMA‐β. Both ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins were associated with sex, HbA1c, serum 25(OH)D3 levels, and HOMA‐IR (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. Serum 25(OH)D3 level was independently positively correlated with ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins (Table 3). Table 3.

Correlation Analysis of Serum 25(OH)D3 Level and Clinical Features, Insulin Resistance, and β‐Cell Function Between Diabetic and Control Groups Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation between serum 25(OH)D3 level and waist‐to‐hip ratio, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, HbA1c, HOMA‐IR, HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30, AUCins, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance rate (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05; Table 4). However, by multiple stepwise regression analysis, only triglycerides (r = −0.19, t = −3.57, P &lt; 0.01), HbA1c (r = −0.52, t = −3.12, P &lt; 0.01) and ΔI30/ΔG30 (r = 0.16, t = 3.92, P &lt; 0.01) emerged as independent factors associated with serum 25(OH)D3 level in diabetic patients and the healthy control group.

Covariates considered were gender, age, body mass index, waist‐to‐hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C). Discussion The current data showed that serum 25(OH)D3 level was significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes compared with that of the healthy control group, and the prevalence of hypovitaminosis 25(OH)D3 was 62.9% in the diabetic patients, corroborating the results of the previous studies, which showed that the baseline 25(OH)D3 concentration was lower in diabetes patients and was inversely associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes19, 20. The vitamin D status of &lt;50 nmol/L has been previously reported to double the risk of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after adjustment for clinical covariables21. In further support of this association, we observed, in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients with decreasing 25(OH)D3 concentration, increasing concentrations of HbA1c, blood glucose and AUCglu, with decreasing insulin levels, AUCins, HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 and HOMA‐IR. These differences were statistically insignificant after adjustment for clinical parameters, including age, sex, BMI, waist‐to‐hip ratio, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL‐C and HDL‐C (F = 1.65, P &gt; 0.05). However, hypovitaminosis D was positively associated with insulin resistance and negatively correlated with β‐cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes11. HbA1c, a global measure of glucose homeostasis, has also been reported to inversely associate with vitamin D status, as measured by serum 25(OH)D levels10, 21, 22. Elevated HbA1c levels might be considered for screening people with vitamin D insufficiency10. Abnormalities could be a result of changes in insulin secretion and sensitivity21, and potential mechanisms contributing to vitamin D regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity include enhanced insulin secretion and synthesis23, and reduced inflammatory processes that reduce the functional capacity of pancreatic β‐cells expressing the vitamin D receptor and the enzyme 1‐a hydroxylase24. HOMA is a widely used clinical and epidemiological tool for assessing β‐cell function and insulin resistance from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin concentrations25; when used appropriately, it can closely mirror the glucose clamp technique in the assessment of insulin sensitivity26. Therefore, HOMA was used to assess insulin resistance and β‐cell function. However, because HOMA was reported to only show what is occurring with glucose homeostasis in the fasting state14, AUCglu, ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins were also used in the present study. Ample evidence has suggested that vitamin D activity is essential for pancreatic β‐cell function, and a higher baseline vitamin D level independently predicted better β‐cell function in subjects who were at risk for type 2 diabetes27-29. Insulin resistance has also been reported to associate with vitamin D insufficiency30, and data on both associations in a single study have been reported. The concentration of 25(OH)D was found to be independently associated with both insulin sensitivity and β‐cell function among individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes9, 11, though another study showed that serum 25(OH)D was not associated with insulin resistance or β‐cell function in the Canadian Cree31. Such controversy might a result of the variability of the method used or ethnic differences. In the present study, our multiple stepwise regression analysis was carried out to investigate the association of 25(OH)D3 levels with the IR and β‐cell function. Our results showed no independent effect of serum 25(OH)D3 level on the insulin resistance index (HOMA‐IR) derived in the basal state, suggesting that serum 25(OH)D3 might not associate with basal or hepatic insulin sensitivity in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. β‐Cell function was determined using HOMA‐β, ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins. The results showed that there was no significant correlation between serum 25(OH)D3 and HOMA‐β, a marker of basal insulin secretion of pancreatic β‐cells, and the latter was found to be independently associated with HbA1c and HOMA‐IR, corroborating the previous results that insulin sensitivity and secretion are mutually related, and that HOMA‐β alone might not accurately assess β‐cell function32. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D affects β‐cells by increasing the insulin response to glucose stimulation and does not affect basal insulin secretion33. HOMA‐β can be considered one aspect of β‐cell function, with the ability to increase basal insulin secretion to meet the elevation of basal glycemia34. Therefore, a correlation analysis of serum 25(OH)D3 concentration and ΔI30/ΔG30 as well as AUCins was carried out. The results showed that serum 25(OH)D3 concentration was significantly positively correlated with ΔI30/ΔG30 and AUCins; serum 25(OH)D3 was also shown to correlate with sex, HbA1c and HOMA‐IR. These results showed that the serum 25(OH)D3 concentration was less correlated with the basal insulin resistance and basal β‐cell function, and was significantly correlated with glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion. Abnormal fat accumulation in the liver, muscle and pancreatic islets plays a crucial role in the development of both β‐cell dysfunction and insulin resistance35. Our findings showed that triacylglycerol emerged as an independent factor that is negatively associated with serum 25(OH)D3 level. A previous study by Liu et al.36 reported that vitamin D, as measured by plasma 25(OH)D, was inversely associated with plasma triacylglycerol in non‐diabetic adults after adjusting for age and sex, but these associations were no longer significant after further adjustment for BMI, waist circumference and current smoking status. Further study is, therefore, still required to clarify the correlation of serum 25(OH)D3 level and triglycerides, and the potential mechanism of their effects on β‐cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. The present study also had some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Most importantly, it was a cross‐sectional study; some parameters and confounding factors, including different, non‐standardized meals taken by our patients and the degree of proteinuria or preferable urinary albumin excretion, were not considered in the present study. Thus, we can only show the existence of a correlation, but not a causal nexus between hypovitaminosis D and glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. In addition, the present study was restricted to one site and took place in a relatively limited number of patients, indicating that interpretation of the results needs to be done with caution. A large cohort of prospective studies should be further carried out to establish the link between hypovitaminosis D and development of type 2 diabetes in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. In conclusion, the present findings support earlier results that showed a low serum 25(OH)D3 concentration in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism. Serum 25(OH)D3 concentration is not correlated with basal insulin resistance or basal β‐cell function, but is significantly positively correlated with glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion and β‐cell function.

Insulin Therapy for Schizophrenia,"THE INSULIN TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA From An Introduction to Physical Methods of Treatment in Psychiatry (First Edition) by William Sargant and Eliot Slater (1944, Edinburgh, E &amp; S Livingstone). Feedback about this article? Not long after insulin came to be generally used in medicine it was found that in small doses it could be used to improve appetite in cases of anorexia, and that there followed a general improvement in the physical and mental state. The clue was not followed up until Sakel came to use insulin hypoglycaemia to counter the symptoms of withdrawal in the treatment of morphine addiction. He found that he got the best results when a sufficient dosage of insulin was given to produce clinical hypoglycemia, and that this phenomenon, hitherto considered dangerous, was readily controlled by the administration of sugar, when the patients were watched throughout. He was led to try its use in the I treatment of schizophrenia, and the Vienna Clinic, which had seen the first introduction of the malarial treatment of general paralysis, provided him with the patients to experiment on. The idea seemed bizarre, but it was found to work. Once tried its results were, in individual patients, so surprisingly favourable that its use spread widely and quickly. In the international congress of 1938 reports were presented of its trial in most of the civilised countries of the world; nearly all of them were favourable. The disorganisation of the war years has to a great extent interrupted its progress in England but it has gone ahead much faster in America. Manfred Sakel STATISTICAL RESULTS Reliable statistics are mostly in favour of the value of the treatment. In a series of over 400 patients treated in Swiss hospitals before 1937, when the technique was still new, 59 per cent. of persons treated within the first six months after onset reached either a complete or social remission. In the New York State hospitals of over a thousand schizo- phrenics treated with insulin 11.1 per cent. recovered, 26.5 per cent. made great improvement, and 26 per cent. some improvement; the corresponding figures in over a thousand control patients were 3.5 per cent., 11.2 per cent. and 7.4 per cent. A comparable number of patients treated with cardiazol convulsion therapy did not do even as well as the control patients. Furthermore, the treatment greatly shortens the duration of the illness. Earl Bond reports that in the Penn- sylvania Hospital 95 per cent, of the patients who were treated and recovered left the hospital within a month of termination of treatment; with few exceptions the un- treated patients who made spontaneous remissions required one to three years for a similar improvement. Thirty-eight per cent. of his treated patients remitted, where there had been previously only 10 per cent, remission and 10 per cent improvements occurring spontaneously. The results are much more favourable when treatment is given early. The New York State hospital figures show that only 27 per cent. of the patients treated in the first six months of the illness failed to improve, whereas this figure rose to 66 per cent. for those whose illness had lasted five years Taking a dividing line of 18 months, Earl Bond finds 67 per cent, recovery and great improvement with treatment given before that time after onset, 30 per cent. after. The prog nostically favourable patients selected for admission to the Maudsley Hospital showed 34.5 per cent. of social recoveries when followed up for three years; 70 per cent, of the patients selected for insulin treatment recovered in the same hospital at a later time. In both these groups the illness had not lasted longer than a year. It is not yet known whether these recoveries will be maintained; but the three to one ratio in frequency of improvement in treated as compared with untreated schizophrenics quoted from the New York State hospitals statistics was still maintained after two years, and 60 per cent. of the insulin treated patients were still living in the community mostly in a recovered or improved condition. Relapses occur both in patients who have recovered spontaneously and with insulin It may be that as the years progress treated and control groups will tend to approximate; but even if this proves to be true one would wish to keep the potential lunatic sane as long as possible, and to give him as long a period as possible of health and happiness. There is also evidence that the relapsed schizophrenic is still susceptible to treatment especially if each relapse is treated immediately it starts. Provided early cases are treated, it is then probably true to say that insulin treatment brings about a remission quicker and in a higher proportion of patients than occurs spon- taneously or with convulsive therapy. There is also a less unanimous impression that the quality of the remission obtained with insulin is better than that of the spontaneous remission; this is likely to be true, if for no other reason than that recovery takes place earlier under treatment and there is less time for the psychological scarring that is the most terrible effect of the disease. There is unanimity that in the earliest months of the illness the results are out of all pro- portion better than later on. In some patients the illness comes on so insidiously that even retrospectively none but the widest limits can be assigned to the time when it started, and these patients it is generally agreed are the most un- favourable therapeutically. This may quite possibly be not because the form of the illness is more malignantordinary clinical judgment suggests the opposite conclusionbut because in all these patients the illness is likely~ to have lasted for months or even years before it is even suspected. Finally, it is clear that there is an art of treatment, in which some will be more adept than others, and that operations cannot be conducted by rule of thumb. Different workers have obtained very different results with the same type of material, both in the frequency of remission and of unpleasant complications. Earl Bond notes that in a group treated in the Pennsylvania Hospital between 1936 and 1938 treatment was given tentatively and was in the hands of several different physicians and all possible risks were avoided; only 46 per cent. of remissions was obtained in cases of less than a years duration. After 1938 a single skilled therapist was employed, and the comparable remission rate rose to 79 per cent. This may be partly because where there is a specific treatment available, patients still in the early stages of the illness are encouraged to seek treatment; but at least part of the im- provement in the recovery rate must be attributed to the greater expertness of the treatment and the giving of really deep comas when necessary. It is only too easy to carry out the treatment in a slipshod or incautious way, or to err on the side of over-easy discouragement. The successful therapist will be gifted with enthusiasm and caution, he will have a sympathetic interest in and a detached appreciation of the personalities of his patients, he will have the general medical training that has accustomed him to the handling of medical emergencies, and the refined clinical judgment of the èx- perienced psychiatrist, and he will have the facilities to give the whole of his energy to the treatment of his patients without administrative after-thought. The abilities of the therapist are not less important than the method of treat- ment adopted. On his skill alone the recovery of any particular patient may ultimately depend. THE SELECTION OF PATIENTS It is rarely indeed that facilities will exist for the treatment by a full course of insulin of all the schizophrenics coming under observation, and it is therefore important not to waste the treatment on patients not very likely to respond while denying it to the favourable case. The first point for considera- tion is the length of duration of the illness, and this does not mean of overt symptoms. The patient who has only recently come to show definite and unmistakable symptoms but has been known to have been gradually becoming queerer for several years is not a favourable case for treatment. The most favourable case would be the patient who had been well up to a few days or weeks of being seen, and he should be selected even if there is some lingering doubt of the true nature of the illness and probabilities only speak in favour of schizophrenia. An atypical onset should not be allowed to develop gradually over the course of months into an unmistakable clinical picture before treatment is begun. This position is likely to arise in atypical manic excitements, in obscure confusional states, and even in depressive states with a suggestion of catatonia, of hallucinations or other suggestive symptoms. In any case it must be remembered that schizophrenic psychoses greatly outnumber all others in persons under the age of thirty. From the much greater success in the early case it follows that once treatment is decided on it should be begun at the earliest possible moment. If there is a waiting list for admission, the early schizophrenic should take precedence of most other patients, firstly for the reason already given, and secondly because in the early stages the clinical picture is very fluid and an attempted suicide, an attack of excitement or violence may remove the patient from the possibility of treatment where it has been arranged to another place where there may be further delays. As even a few weeks makes a difference, this would be a serious matter. The rapidity with which treatment can be inaugurated after the onset of the illness is by far the most important factor therapeutically. Next in importance ranks the quality of the personality before the illness began. A frank, open and socially well-adjusted personality reacts better than one which has always been shy, shut off, awkward and autistic. There are probably a number of reasons for this. The autistic personality may not have always been so, but have become so as the result of an early and unrecognised schizophrenic process, which -has perhaps become chronic, only to show a recent florid exacerbation. Further, restoration cannot at its optimum be to the same level in the defective as in the thoroughly normal personality. This is perhaps the principal factor that militates against the successful treatment of schizophrenia in the intellectually retarded. Rapidity of onset is generally held to be a favourable factor, which would imply that in two schizophrenics in both of whom the illness was of three months' duration, the one in whom it began in florid form would have the advantage over the other in whom it began gradually. This may be because in the latter the true point of onset would be set further back ; but it may also be because the more acute illness is more easily reversible. The bodily physique has been found to be of importance, and the pyknic or athletic habitus is more favourab!e than the asthenic and the dysplastic. This is a very general clinical impression, and has recently been confirmed by Freudenberg. Freudenberg has also found that an abundance of "" process symptoms,"" such as hallucinations, thought disorder, primary delusions, passivity feelings, etc., are unfavourable. A history of a previous attack with a full remission, is on the other hand, a favourable sign. It is also our impression that an atypical quality in the symptomatology is a sign of good omen. These favourable and unfavourable factors seem to act cumulatively, and very satisfactory results can be expected from the patient who shows all of the first and none of the second, whereas if the opposite is true treatment is hardly worth while. In patients who fall between these two groups the results obtained will also be intermediate; there will not be the same frequency of complete success as in the most favourable group, but considerable improvement, sufficient for social rehabilitation, will often be obtained even where a complete remission appears unattainable. It will be seen that the factors that favour a satisfactory response to insulin are also those clinically associated with a higher expectation of spontaneous remission; but this would be an inadequate argument in favour of a laissez-faire attitude. The tragedies of neglected insulin treatment in England are to-day a commonplace to the psychiatrist of experience; we have as yet seen no tragedies from premature treatment skilfully applied. THE RISKS OF TREATMENT The risks of treatment are in general less than the risks of waiting for spontaneous remission to occur. Massed figures gathered in the United States give a mortality of 90 deaths in 12,000 patients treated, of which about half were due to hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, which is thus seen to be the most serious risk of treatment; it is, on the other hand, a:n avoidable risk and is the rarer the more skilled the operator. In this series there were also twelve deaths from heart failure, nine from aspiration pneumonia, seven from pneumonia occurring otherwise, some of which were probably also avoid- able. The New York State hospital figures show that there was a higher mortality in the untreated than in the treated patients. It may be that patients with better physique were selected for treatment, and if so that could partly explain the result. It is also true that the patient's bodily health rapidly deteriorates. under an acute schizophrenic psychosis, thereby laying him open to a greater risk of tuberculosis and intercurrent disease .han where the process is cut short by treatment. Twelve patients died of pulmonary tuberculosis in the control group, only one in the insulin treated group. A mortality of less than one per cent. cannot be considered a reasonable bar to treatment in the average patient; and the risk of death or serious damage to bodily health can be neglected in all but the physically ill. Any advanced degree of cardiac disease is usually considered a contraindication to treatment, as are also Graves disease, diabetes, liver and kidney diseases causing marked impairment of function. Treatment can be dangerous, and is rarely successful, above the age of forty-five. Careful investigations have shown that in patients with a prolonged series of deep comas there is sometimes a mild degree of intellectual impairment the effect is much smaller than that also seen in patients of all kinds treated by con- vulsion therapy, which is far from great or constant. The degree of impairment has been of practical importance in only a handful of patients reported in the literature, and is in any case not comparable with the disability caused by the disease itself. Mental impairment is of much greater im- portance after long irreversible coma, and a severe Korsakow picture can result from this. This improves somewhat as a rule, but usually leaves a greater or lesser degree of permanent impairment. Its occurrence is the principal reason why the deliberate production of irreversible comas, which often have an immediate curative effect on the schizophrenic process, has not been extensively tried as a method of treatment, and should remain exclusively in the hands of treatment experts of long experience. A minor but still important reason why treatment as early as possible is so desirable, is that there is a lesser necessity for repeated deep comas, with the attendant risk of irreversible coma. THE TECHNIQUE OF TREATMENT We are indebted to the Journai of Mental Science for permission to include in this chapter the illustration and some of the details of technique from an article by Fraser and Sargent 1940 The beginner would be well advised, before starting this treatment, to go for a week or more if possible to a hospital where it is done on a fair scale. The technique cannot .be learned from books alone, and some practical experience is necessary of the dangers that may be met with. The following technique here described mostly arises from experience gained from 1937 onwards at the Maudsley Hospital in conjunction with Dr. Russell Fraser, and subsequently in an E.M.S. Neurological Unit where early cases could be admitted and treated under the conditions obtaining in a general hospital. Lack of the best facilities should not prevent treatment altogether; and the dangers of treatment under adverse cir- cumstances may have to be balanced against the dangers of delay. It is quite possible to carry out the insulin treatment of schizophrenia in a general ward, with the patient screened off during the coma period. Nevertheless where schizophrenics are going to be treated in any number a special insulin treatment unit is very desirable. Excited patients cannot be easily handled in general wards, and even quietly behaved schizophrenics are likely to become noisy and difficult during hypoglycaemia. A fairly large room should be taken, in which all the patients it is proposed to treat at one time can be kept economically under observation: off this there should be one or two side-rooms available for the more restless and noisy. These rooms will be kept at a warm temperature, as patients perspire profusely and often throw off their bedclothes. To staff the unit a well-trained team of nurses is required, of whom as many as possible should have both a general and a psychiatric training. Experience of medical and surgical emergencies is very valuable in the management of this complicated method of treatment. A sister should be in charge, and on duty during the treatment period every day. Changes in staff from day to day mean that minor alterations in the behaviour of individual patients during sopor and coma may be missed, to the danger of the patients: for behaviour varies widely from patient to patient while remaining very constant to the individual, and a nurse who knows the patient well can detect signs of danger Jhat would not be at all noticeable to anyone else. Every effort should therefore be made to keep the team together, and avoid changes of more than one of the personnel at a time or at less than well-spaced intervals. The sister is of coutse the most important of all; and it will be her responsibility to assemble and maintain the equipment so that none is astray at an emergency. The patients also should be kept together through the greater part of the day. Their food intake at every meal has to be carefully supervised, and they themselves must be kept under supervision to prevent the occurrence of after-shocks in the afternoon or evening. If they go out in the afternoon, it should be in the company of a nurse supplied with glucose to give to any of them who may suddenly develop a recurrence of hypoglycemic symptoms. Apart from the usual ward apparatus such as intravenous syringes (1 to 20 c.c.), intravenous needles kept freshly sharpened and in perfect state, a variety of small basins, swabs, surgical spirit, etc., the following special equipment is required: blood-pressure apparatus, air-way, tongue-clips, mouth gag for use in the event of a fit (a rubber heel covered in mackintosh or a dogs small rubber bone are serviceable), an emergency apparatus for giving 5 per cent. carbon dioxide in oxygen, ampoules of adrenalin, morphine, hyoscine, 10 per cent. calcium chloride, sodium amytal, atropine, coramine, eucortone, nicotinic acid, vit. B.1, and luminal (all suitable for intravenous and intramuscular use). The means of cutting down on a vein should also be at hand. On one or two small portable trays are placed the means of nasal interruption. The nasal tubes selected should be stiff and of fine bore, and should be discarded when they get soft from repeated boiling. On the same trays there will be lubricating oil, litmus paper and an aspiration syringe for sucking out a test sample of the stomach contents through the nasal tube. The container of 600 c.c. of 38 per cent. sugared tea (6.5 oz. sugar to the pint) is also on this tray. The tea should be prepared before treatment starts in the morning and kept till needed in bulk in a large jug containing sufficient for the needs of all patients. This reservoir of sugared tea must be kept warm, for instance in a large thermos jug, and from it the smaller receptacles for individual trays can be filled just before interruption. Another special tray or trolley holds the equipment for an emergency intravenous interruptionone or two syringes each containing 20 c.c. of fresh sterile 83 per cent. glucose solution and a sterilised bowl from which they may be rapidly refilled. Sealed bottles of 38 per cent. glucose should also be at hand, and only opened before the injection starts. There should be ample amounts of 5 per cent. glucose saline ready for emer- gency intravenous use, but it need not be specially heated. Sarganta and Fraser have adapted for use in insulin therapy a composite pressure apparatus which avoids the necssity of having to change syringes in giving large quantities of 33 per cent glucose or glucose salines intravenously, with the risk of losing one's place in the vein every time the change is made. From the illustration it will be seen that it is a simple pressure bottle attached to a syringe with a side-valve. The needle is inserted into the vein, and with the first part of the plunger, blood is sucked into the syringe, thereby showing that the needle is in position. Further withdrawal of the plunger beyond the side-valve allows the 33 per cent glucose solution in the pressure bottle to flow freely through the syringe into the vein. Bottles of 5 per cent saline are kept in stock which also fit the same screwcap of the apparatus. If after the 33 per cent glucose has been given, a change to 5 per cent glucose or saline is required, this is effected simply by unscrewing one bottle and screwing on the other, pressure being re-established by more hand pumping. Through all this, the doctor's attention can be concentrated on the more important job of keeping the needle in place in the vein, a ticklish matter if the patient is excited and restless, while the nurse does the pumping and changes the bottles if .necessary. Emergency drugs such as coramine can be injected into the rubber connection between the bottle and the side-valve syringe without further interference with the veins. For the avoidance of unnecessary risks, the closest atten- tion to record keeping is required. The quality of the records will often distinguish a good clinic from a careless one. Four separate records are recommended. There should be a tem- perature chart, on which are entered the temperature, pulse and respiration rate daily at 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., the diet taken (as full, half, or excess), any tube feed that may have had to be given, the daily insulin dose, duration of coma and time taken to awake after interruption. Any special com- plication is marked by an asterisk on the chart. The weight recorded weekly or hi-weekly is also noted. A space is left at the side of the chart for entering the average coma dose of insulin and the maximum safe period of coma for that par- ticular patient, after these have been ascertained during the treatment. A daily treatment chart is also kept. On it are shown half- hourly records of pulse and respiration rate during treatment, the amount of sweating, the amounts of insulin and glucose given each day, the time of onset of sopor and coma and the time taken to come round after interruption. Details of the patients behaviour and neurological abnormalities in sopor and coma are also noted here. In a conspicuous and convenient position in the ward there is a treatment board. On it are marked the times of onset of sopor and coma, the time when each patient is due to be in- terrupted, the time he is actually interrupted and the time of his awakening. It is filled in as these events occur by the doctor and nurses. The important data it provides can be read at a glance from any part of the ward, and help to prevent delays and omissions when emergencies engage the attention of the staff too exclusively to one patient. It is also useful for providing the data of the more detailed and permanent records. Lastly, there should be an insulin dosage book, in which the next days doses are entered at the end of each mornings work. It is for the information of the sister or nurse in charge when giving the insulin the next morning. Before treatment is begun, it is desirable to deal with any septic foci that may be present, at least if of gross degree and fairly easily treated. There is evidence that insulin resistance is increased by even a mild infective process. Great importance should be placed on giving a correctly balanced diet during treatment. If possible, measured normal meals should be prescribed and kept approximately of the same content each day. Excess of carbohydrates in the diet enhances the probability of after-shocks by increasing insulin sensitivity. The aim should be to have every patient on a constant diet, a regular daily routine and the same length of coma each morning. When the metabolism is kept steady in this way, it is rare to get sudden changes in the response to the morning insulin or the occurrence of after-shock, Furthermore, any ominous irregularity in behaviour is more likely to be noticed and reported. If the diet taken is inadequate tube-feeding must be resorted to. It must be re- membered that a morning dose of insulin may still be in process of absorption for eighteen hours after it has been injected. Much of the treatment devolves on the nurse, and on her skill its success depends. Provided she is well chosen, the more responsibility she is given the better the standard of work she will attain. The sister and the senior nurses should be trained in all details of the technique, from the passing of the stomach-tube to the intravenous interruption, and they should be able to carry out these procedures with confidence. They learn to judge for themselves when the patient is going too deep, or showing abnormal symptoms, and to report to the doctor in time. In an emergency they are taught to act for themselves, and may have to do so if complications arise in several patients at a time and the doctors whole attention has to be concentrated on only one. If the selected male and female nursing staff are trained to a high pitch of efficiency, a greater number of patients can be treated than if the doctor has to undertake every routine procedure himself. A doctor must always be on call, but it is not necessary with a trained staff for him to be in the insulin room except during the times of sopor and coma. If the nurses have been especially well selected and trained they can even be left to handle the early stages of sopor and light coma provided the doctor can get to the treatment ward within a minute of being summoned. We give full treatment on five days a week. On the sixth half-doses of insulin are given, and the seventh is a rest day. If time is short, however, full treatment can be advantage- ously given on six days a week. The commencing dose of insulin is usually 20 units at 7 a.m. given intramuscularly by the nurse in charge, with the patient fasting from 8 p.m. the night before, and the dose is increased by this amount each day of full treatment until sopor occurs, when progression of dosage may be slower. When high doses of insulin have been reached without sopor, the jump may be 80 to 40 units each morning instead of 20 units. Once coma has been induced, the insulin dose should be adjusted until the minimum satisfactory coma dose has been found. Neglect of this principle will lead to the occurrence of irreversible comas. Insulin sensitivity frequently increases during treatment, and the regular daily dose may eventually be stabilised at half the amount that was necessary to produce the first coma. Furthermore, often enough the patient seems consciously to resist going into sopor or coma, and when he finally does so a much lower dose of insulin is needed to induce the same state on subsequent occasions. Sometimes sodium amytal gr. 3 to 6 has been given by mouth at 7 a.m. when the insulin is given. This may make the patient less restless and enable him to pass more smoothly into sopor. This dose of amytal is not enough to make the sleep induced by the drug indis- tinguishable from the hypoglycemic phenomena. Sometimes very high doses of insulin fail to produce conih at all. Then the doses must be swung. On one day 240 units should be given, and then in rotation 40, 120 and 240 units. In this way insulin sensitivity may often be increased to the point where a satisfactory coma is induced. Insulin resistance up to 600 units has, however, been reported, and the phenomena of insulin resistance are little understood. Some patients, for instance, may go into coma with as little as 40 units or even less. There is much confusion about the correct use of the word coma"". It is generally agreed that the length of time the patient is actually unconscious is the best index of the severity of a period of hypoglycemia. Yet in papers on technique daily comas of two and a half hours are recommended by some, while others advocate only three-quarters of an hour. These discrepancies are due to differences in the meaning given to the word coma. The criteria of coma given by Kuppers have been adopted in our work. He differentiates the stages of loss of consciousness into sopor or pre-coma and true coma. Because of individual variations it is generally found that reflexes, motor phenomena, and most other physical signs cannot be used as criteria of onset of either of these stages, and reliance has to be placed on tests for the presence or absence of  conscious  or purposive reactions. The onset of sopor is usually indicated by the loss of a normal response to speech and impairment of orientation. But testing will still elicit Ssome confused but purposive re- sponses. There may be some difficulty in deciding the exact time of onset of sopor from earlier degrees of hypoglyc~mia. This is not so important as to recognise when sopor deepens into coma. The onset of coma is distinguished by the loss of all purposive responses, simulating those of the conscious patient, even on careful testing. There should be no responses from visual, auditory or tactile stimuli. Painful stimuli may still produce some movements, but these are not directed towards the stimulus., Tests should include raising and dropping the patients arm, trying to make his eyes follow a moving object, and giving a painful stimulus such as pressure on the supraorbital nerve. As coma supervenes the eyes may still remain open and some non-purposive movements persist, but the absence of purposive response can always be demon- strated by testing. Some patients, while still in sopor and aware of the test stimuli, lose all initiative to respond. They must be distinguished from those in coma, and generally painful stimuli will reveal the difference. THE SECOND PHASE The second phase of treatment starts when the patient begins to go into sopor. The regulation of hypoglycaemia to achieve the maximum degree of safety is best done by con- centrating on the duration of actual coma rather than of sopor. But very occasionally hypoglycaemia has become ""irreversible when the patient is allowed to remain at the stage of apparent sopor for a very long tIme. As a precaution, therefore, interruption is carried out after an hour and a half of sopor, if coma has not supervened. When the patient has begun to go into coma the length of the coma period allowed is increased gradually from five minutes on the first day to what proves to be the maximum safe duration for the individual. Using the criteria given above, the average daily period is half an hour, with con- siderable individual variations above and below this figure. The physician should not rely on rule of thumb, but should try to discover the safety limit for each patient. He may be warned that coma is getting too deep by the patient taking over twenty minutes to awake after the nasal feed. He should be guided by this, or interrupt when other signs of excessive depth occur. As the patients physique improves with treat- ment, longer comas can be tolerated than initially; this will be indicated by changes in the depth of coma or alteration in waking time. Sometimes it may be desired to take the patient particularly deep. If this is done it is wise to interrupt immediately afterwards by the intravenous route, and not to wait a further twenty minutes or less for the patient to come round after a nasal interruptionunless after thorough testing this has been found to be safe. A particularly severe coma is also apt to cause an increased susceptibility to the next days insulin, and this must be remembered if deep comas are given. To prevent irreversible coma, a shorter coma is advised on the day following a deep coma, particularly if there have been signs of shock or delayed awakening. For the general run of patients, it is best to give a maximum safe coma treatment, and to stick to it each day until recovery is manifest. Some patients, however, do well with submaximal comas, and others need dangerously deep comas to achieve results. This is why results vary from therapist to therapist, and success depends so much on his skill. With increas- ing depth of coma comes an added risk of irreversible coma, and great skill is needed to handle this emergency, but the risk must be faced if it is necessary to the patients recovery. Our remarks apply to comas occurring at the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth hours, and are not applicable to those beginning in the fifth hour. Margins of safety must necessarily be loWer in the latter. The insulin dosage should be so adjusted as to induce coma about three hours after injection. SIGNS OF DANGER, EXCESSIVE DEPTH AND EXHAUSTION Signs of excessive depth call for interruption at any stage of coma. The peripheral circulation and blood pressure are valuable indicators of circulatory embarrassment, and re- peated examination of the finger tips is advisable. When the blood pressure falls below 100mm. or the peripheral circulation becomes poor the coma should usually be interrupted. A falling blood pressure and a rising pulse or respiration rate should always be regarded as a danger sign, especially if combined with signs of failure of peripheral circulation. Interruption must be done in good time; the tube feed may be vomited or poorly absorbed, and when intravenous inter- ruption is attempted the veins may be found to be collapsed and may then have to be cut down on. If pulse irregularities first appear during the later stages of coma and the pulse drops below 55, interruption is advisable. Earlier pulse irregularities before the onset of coma often subside with its onset, and should only require caution when they are frequent or persist for over half an hour. As a general rule, provided the blood pressure remains above 100, the pulse volume is good and the pulse between 70 and 100 per minute, these patients may be left for three-quarters of an hour before interruption. Some patients who start with extra-systoles in the initial stages of treatment lose them as treatment progresses. Motor neurological signs are of little help in determining the onset of coma, but they are useful indications of its depth. In the earlier phase various types of movement may appear; they are clinically important only if they are excessive and produce exhaustion. Occasionally they may be the pre- monitory signs of an impending fit. The movements should not be allowed to continue for over an hour and a half or less if the patient is becoming exhausted by them. Premedication with luminal gr. 1 to 2 or sodium amytal gr. 8 to 6 may help to diminish them or prevent their occurrence. If the jerking and movements are too great it is sometimes advisable to give intravenous sodium amytal gr. 2 to 3.5 at the time to reduce them. The drowsiness induced by such a small dose of intravenous amytal is easily distinguished from true coma and may enable the patient to pass through the restless phase into coma. According to Mayer-Gross severe hyperkinetic conditions, restlessness and noisy excitement, can also be controlled by giving a part or the whole of the morning insulin dose intra- venously. This brings on the deeper and quieter stages of coma more quickly. One has to learn by trial in each case how much of the total dose to give intramuscularly early on, and how much intravenously at a later stage in the days treatment. In the deeper stages of coma waves of extensor tonus occur which are well seen in the arms as combined extension and pronation. They are really important, as they indicate that the safe limit of coma is being reached. But these move- ments are often precipitated or exaggerated by respiratory embarrassment or circulatory failure. If the air passages are freed by inserting a Hewletts airway and the extensor tonus then subsides, coma may be allowed to continue. When these waves of extensor tonus are only spasmodic and the state of the circulation is satisfactory, coma may be continued for a further fifteen minutes before interruption. But to be on the safe side it may be advisable to interrupt intravenously at the end of this time and not await the slower operation of a nasal feed. If the waves persist for longer than a minute, or the circulation is poor, immediate interruption should be done. Generalised tremor when the patient is not cold is another important sign of excessive depth and calls for early inter- ruption. After going into coma sometimes the patient awakens spontaneously, generally after a period of severe spasmodic movements. If he is allowed to relapse into coma agail after this it should oniy be for half the normal length of coma, or even less, as this phenomenon may be the precursor of an irreversible coma. The condition of the reflexes is of little help in giving warning of excessive depth. More im- portant is any change from the usual ueurological pattern seen during previous comas. If unconsciousness seems deeper or the neurological pattern different from the usual for that particular patient, and the circulation is poor, interruption should be done as a precautionary measure. OTHER COMPLICATIONS Epileptic fits occur early or late in the hypoglycaemic period. The early fit occurs 45 to 100 minutes after the start of treatment and before the onset of coma. It is generally easy to manage. Often after it is over the patient wakes up spontaneously and can drink his sugared tea, or glucose can be given nasally or intravenously if he remains confused. Fits occurring in late sopor or during coma are more dangerous and may be followed, especially in the case of those occurring in the later stages of coma, by delayed recovery or severe shock. Immediate intravenous interruption is necessary for these later fits. Sometimes absorption of sugar from the stomach does not occur for some hours afterwards, and therefore further intravenous glucose may be necessary in an hours time, and even again later in the day. Fluids are valuable when signs of shock are present; up to 500 cc. of 5 per cent. glucose saline may be given after an initial 250 cc. of 33 per cent. glucose intravenously. Late fits in the stage of. coma probably indicate excessive cerebral glycopenia, and that is why they should be dealt with efficiently and rapidly. Respiratory complications occasionally arise from aspiration of saliva during coma, because of increase of salivation and diminution of protective reflexes. In the later stages of sopor and during coma the patient is best turned on his side to permit the saliva to drool out of the mouth. Respiratory stridor occurring in coma and not due to blocking of the air passages nor relieved by passage of an airway calls for im- mediate intravenous interruption as it may be a dangerous complication. Vomiting after nasal interruption can often be dealt with by giving atropine gr .001 to .02 intramuscularly some minutes before the nasal feed. It is only a dangerous complication when it indicates a condition of shock. If it does, the treat- ment of shock will be required, i.e. intravenous glucose and, if necessary, saline. INTERRUPTION In the lightest stages of hypoglycemia the patient can, as a rule, drink 600 c.c. of 33 per cent. sugared tea (for preference flavoured with lemon) at the end of treatment. In sopor and coma the same amount has to be given by means of a nasal tube. When the tube has been passed, gastric juice should be withdrawn and tested for acidity with litmus paper before the sugar is poured down the tube. When the gastric juice is only weakly acid a teaspoonful of salt is added in case chloride deficiency is being caused by excessive sweating. When coma has been deep it is unwise to allow more than twenty minutes to elapse in waiting for the patient to come round before giving glucose intravenously. This time may have to be shortened if coma remains deep or other signs of danger are present. When a skilful technique in the pre- servation of the veins and the use of the pressure bottle has been acquired, therapy may be conducted on the basis of a routine intravenous interruption. Longer and deeper comas can then be given with greater safety. The state of the veins must be kept under observation and one or two unharmed veins should be always kept in reserve for use in emergency; if thrombosis has occurred in most of the conveniently placed veins a return to nasal interruptions is indicated. In inter- ruption by the intravenous route 100 c.c. of 83 per cent. glucose is generally sufficient, but up to 250 c.c. may be given with safety. The patient receives further sugar to drink when he awakes. After the patient has come round he may be given a light breakfast. Lunch should be given about 1 p.m., tea at 4.30, and another meal in the evening. The commonest time for after shocks is about four hours after interruption. If the patient is not taking proper meals additional glucose may be given at this time as a prophylactic.. But it has already been pointed out that too great a carbohydrate preponderance in the diet is undesirable. Regular balanced supervised meals at the right times and a correct morning dose of insulin are the best prevention of after-shocks. IRREVERSIBLE COMA This is a dangerous complication in which unconsciousness persists despite the giving of adequate intravenous glucose. In severe cases there are pronounced vascular shock, hypertonus, writhing movements, and the condition resembles one of anoxia. The milder cases may merely show delayed local recovery, such as monoplegia or aphasia or a slight confusional state of short duration. The severe case may involve days of unconsciousness, but with skilful handling death should be avoided. The pathology of the condition is unknown; but treatment must be directed towards facilitating the entry of glucose into the brain cells, combating the alkalosis and anoxia, and restoration of the circulation to its maximal efficiency. We have seen great benefit from the giving of large amounts of intravenous salines in these cases. When the patient does not come round as he should with the intra- venous administration of 100 c.c. of 38 per cent, glucose, this condition must be assumed to be present; and before the needle is withdrawn an additional 150 c.c. of 33 per cent. glucose should be immediately given. If the patient still has not come round, 10 to 80 c.c. of 10 per cent. calcium chloride, 2 to 4 c.c. of coramine, 20 mgms. of vitamin B. 1, and 500 to 1000 c.c. of 5 per cent, glucose in saline should be given intra- venously, starting as soon as possible. The end of the bed should be raised, 5 per cent. CO2 in oxygen is given to the patient and warmth applied, including hot-water bottles, as for shock. After these measures the degree of shock should be subsiding, and the rectal temperature will generally rise, but the patient is often still very restless. An injection of morphia and hyoscine is useful for allaying this. An hour after the first injection a second injection of 250 c.c. of 33 per cent. glucose, together with a further 500 c.c. of saline, should be given if necessary. If treatment has been prompt and efficient, by this time the danger of acute collapse is usually past; but the patient may not recover consciousness for many hours or even days. Often absorption from the stomach starts again very slowly, and further intravenous glucose has to be given later in the day, as insulin is still being absorbed from the morning Thjection. A stomach-tube should be passed when first aid measures have been completed, and four-hourly nasal feeds of glucose are given. If these are not being absorbed they are withdrawn every four hours and fresh glucose substituted until stomach absorption restarts. Each time the previous feed is found unabsorbed, or has been vomited, 500 c.c. of 5 per cent, glucose in saline should be given intravenously. In very severe cases in which it does not appear probable that the patient will come round tor a long time a vein should be cut down on and a continuous glucose saline drip started. Blood transfusions may be given alternat- ing with the saline drip. Eucortone has been recommended. Nicotinic acid mgms. 100 four-hourly may also be given during the period of unconsciousness by the intravenous route via the continuous drip. The patients strength must be maintained by intravenous feeding till stomach absorption restarts. With prompt treatment recovery from this condition gener- ally takes place in the first twenty-four hours; but a period of unconsciousness lasting six days has been seen, when the doctor had failed to institute emergency measures immediately. After long periods of unconsciousness very marked impair- ment of intellectual functions will be seen, but a surprising degree of recovery from this will occur in succeeding weeks and months. Following short-lived irreversible comas some dramatic improvements in schizophrenic symptomatology have been recorded. If, with effective measures, the patient has emerged rapidly from irreversible coma, the fact that the complication has occurred does not imply that treatment should be abandoned. It may be started again in three or four days time, but thereafter the comas must be kept much shorter. On several occasions we have known treatment, started again under these circumstances, to proceed without further mischance to a successful conclusion. CLINICAL CHANGES PRODUCED BY TREATMENT In patients who are going to react well to the treatment it will generally be found that after the first few comas, wakening from coma leads to an hour or two of a considerably improved mental state. Sometimes in the early case improvement occurs without the coma stage having been reached. The most prominent change is a great improvement in rapport and the affective attitude. For a time the patient regards the doctor and the nurses in a much warmer and more friendly manner, suspicion is for the moment in abeyance, and there is often a considerable degree of insight into the delusions, feel- ings of unreality, etc. After this short interval, however, the patient sinks back into his old state, and remains in it for the rest of the day. Patients who are excited, agitated or panicky are often much improved in this respect for a longer period of time. As the days of treatment succeed one another the beneficial change lasts longer, and the state into which the patient relapses becomes less hind less severe, until gradually the improvement is maximal. In the most fortunate patients this may occur with astonishing rapidity, less than a fortnight of intensive therapy sufficing to bring about what appears to be a complete cure. In order to judge whether the maximum amount of benefit has been gained it is necessary to have a very thorough knowledge of the patients symptoms and clinical state before beginning treatment. As improvement takes place delusions and other morbid ideas which have hitherto been concealed may be brought to the light of day, and give a false im- pression to the naive that the state is becoming more acute. A very careful clinical examination should be repeated when the termination of treatment is being considered; and treat- ment should not be stopped if there are any signs of activity of the disease, unless it is thought hopeless to proceed any further. By this it is not meant that the patient must have full insight into the symptoms of the past, but that there should not still be hallucinations occurring, or feelings of influence or passivity, etc. Furthermore, it is probably desirable to continue a more modified form of insulin treatment until the patient has regained the physique that is normal and healthy for him. It is quite possible that relapse is more likely, even when there is complete restoration of mental normality, if a really good state of bodily health has not been regained. Mental im- provement and physical improvement usually go side by side, but one may lag a bit behind the other. If the patient regains his normal weight and physical state, and retains his mental symptoms unaltered, it is a bad sign, and it is usually not worth proceeding much further. Most favourable cases respond to treatment within two months. Sometimes recovery seems to occur two to four weeks after treatment has been completed. If no change has been brought about in three months, and every therapeutic trick has been tried, it is unlikely that there will be a favourable outcome, USE OF CONVULSIVE THERAPY WITH INSULIN Although convulsive therapy is no method of treatment of the schizophrenic psychosis itself, it can often play an adjuvant part, and be particularly useful for dealing with individual symptoms. Depression in schizophrenia, as in basically different disorders, is often much improved by a few electrical fits; and their use before the treatment proper is begun may allow the patient to be more easily treated, and may, if neces- sary, permit the physician to get a clearer perception of how much schizophrenic disturbance there is actually present. Depression in schizophrenia is a secondary symptom, possibly partly psychogenic in origin, possibly partly a result of the metabolic changes that are having a total effect on the patients health; but the intensity of the affective change may obscure the realisation of the more fundamental and ominous symptoms. The hypothymia, lassitude and anergia, which are more directly related to the schizophrenic process may also clear up under the influence of a few convulsions, which are more likely to be required for that purpose after the termination of insulin treatment than before it has begun. Catatonic stupor usually yields to convulsive therapy, but sometimes passes into a catatonic excitement. Convulsions should then be used if there is doubt of the diagnosis, or if the catatonic state interferes with the practical details of insulin therapy, e.g. in the intake of an adequate diet, Qr if the condition fails to respond fairly rapidly to insulin and a depressive component is suspected. The insulin treatment will itself be nearly always required to establish ground gained by convulsive therapy, and to prevent the possibility of rapid relapse. Insulin will also remedy sympl~ms of thought disorder untouched by convulsions. There is some evidence that a few convulsions may be of benefit during the course of insulin treatment, for instance when the patient has started to improve, but has failed to maintain improvement. Where the two treatments are combined they should be given separately and not on the same day. The role of convulsive therapy in schizophrenia is therefore a supplementary but important one; the improvements claimed in the past from convulsions alone have mostly been symp- tomatic ones without significance for the course of the disease, or have proved temporary. Some of the few apparent cures may well have occurred in what were fundamentally depressive illnesses, with a schizoid colouring derived from the structure of the personality. The highest recovery rate in any large and varied group of cases .initiaiiy diagnosed as schizophrenia will be achieved when insulin and convulsion therapy are skilfully combined in differing proportions in each case, based on the actual symptomatology shown. PSYCHOTHERAPY In our view the time has passed when one can legitimately treat schizophrenia by non-physical methods alone, and the claims that are from time to time made of the necessity of combining psychotherapy with insulin treatment seem to be exaggerated. Many patients make an uninterrupted recovery under insulin treatment without any special psycho- therapeutic handling whatever. The apparent psychological precipitants of a schizophrenic illness are frequently found when the insight gained into the illness is fairly complete to have been not part causes of the illness but the earliest signs of its onset. The type of psychotherapy that is most required with the schizophrenic patient is of a kind that might be found valuable after any grave physical illness. Once he is re- covered the patient has to return to the outside world and try to manage his own affairs without the constant advice of the doctor; it will often help if the way is made a little smoother for him. While the disease is in active progress it is hopeless to try to influence the patients ways of thinking; but it is not so hopeless when the fundamental thought disorder has been abolished, and there are only a few fragmentary delusional beliefs, suspicions or foci of apprehension which are left over as relics from the past. It is probably beneficial to get into contact with the patient during the best half hour or so of the day immediately on wakening after treatment, and to give him then the im- pression of friendly assistance, even though, as is probable, any influence one can exert on his morbid ideas is of the most trifling duration. As soon as he is well enough he should be kept fully occupied in the afternoon with occupation therapy, gardening, games, walks, visits to the cinema, and so on. When recovery has occurred the possibilities of explanation and reassurance are much more favourable. The patient will probably have a very clear memory for a time of his many morbid experiences, and will be anxious to get some explanation for them. Reassurance will also often be required on the subject of relapse. It should not be concealed from the patient that relapse may occur, but he should be told that the prospects of treatment need be no worse, should a relapse occur, than they have been with his first illness, and that if he only seeks advice in the early days of such a recurrence, they are bright indeed; he should, of course, on the other hand, be encouraged not to worry about himself, nor to keep forever a finger on the pulse of his mind. FOLLOW-UP When recovery has occurred it is advisable to discharge the patient from hospital as rapidly as possible. Return to the normal environment, and an abbreviated recollection of the hospital atmosphere will aid the patient in the recovery of his self-confidence and powers of adaptation. But it is ad- visable to keep an eye on the patient in an out-patient clinic fairly regularly for a month or so, and then it is wise to ask for three-monthly attendances for another year. If there is the slightest sign of any relapse it should be promptly dealt with, and though a relapse may occur at any time up to many years later, it is most likely to occur fairly soon.

In such case although the production of insulin is enough in amount but the cells in our body becomes resistant to insulin and stops the entry of insulin into the cell. Being overweight stresses the insides of individual cells. Specifically, too much of eating stresses the membranous network inside cells known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER). once the ER has a lot more nutrients to process than it can handle, it sends out alarm signal telling the cell to dampen down the hypoglycemic agent receptors on the cell surface. This interprets to hypoglycemic agent resistance and to persistently high concentrations of the sugar aldohexose within the blood. This is one of the confirming signs of diabetes.Diabetes and EndocrinologyThe human body secretes hormones to maintain the chemical balance in the body in order to run our body smoothly. These hormones are released in our body by some glands that are considered to be the part of the endocrine system. The major endocrine organs present in our body include pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenalin gland, ovaries, testes and pancreas.In diabetes patients the main problem that incurs due to the endocrine system is the hormone imbalance. This is because of the lack or excessive secretion of the hormone from their respective gland. But diabetes is majorly a pancreatic disorder that is incurred due to irregular release of Insulinvar Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();(function(){var s1=document.createElement(""script""),s0=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];s1.async=true;s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5cbdc118d6e05b735b43b268/default';s1.charset='UTF-8';s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);})();var Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();(function(){var s1=document.createElement(""script""),s0=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];s1.async=true;s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5c3f11e351410568a106e0f6/default';s1.charset='UTF-8';s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);})();Endocrinology and MetabolismEndocrinology is the study of the endocrine system in the body. This is a system of glands which secrete hormones .Humans have over 50 different hormones. They exist in small amounts and still have a significant impact on bodily function and development. Hormones regulate metabolism, respiration, growth, reproduction, sensory perception and movement. Hormone imbalances are the underlying reason for a wide range of medical conditions. Endocrinology focuses on both the hormones and the glands and tissues that produce them.Diabetes and Metabolic DisordersThe metabolism of people with diabetes is almost identical to the metabolism of people without diabetes. The only difference is the volume or effectiveness of the insulin produced by the body. In type 2 diabetes, the effectiveness of insulin is reduced and in type 1 diabetes, insulin levels in the body are very low but the proper functioning of metabolism is reliant on the delivery of insulin. This can be done with introduction of external insulin to the body with the help of injection or pump.Pancreatitis and InsulinThe pancreas is academic degree organ placed behind the lower a vicinity of the abdomen, above the spine and plays a really a vital role in diabetes. The pancreas is that the organ that produces the insulin, one the foremost hormones that helps to manage hexose or the blood sugar glucose levels by aiding the transport of aldohexose from the blood into neighboring cells. The cells that manufacture the insulin are known as beta cells. Endocrine Glands and HormonesEndocrine disorders can be classified according to the intensity of hormonal activity and according to the origin of endocrine disorder. From the intensity of hormonal activity of endocrine gland we can distinguish hyper function of endocrine gland, which is characterized by increased secretion of its hormone as well as by increased concentration of this hormone in circulating blood.Clinical Researches in Diabetes (Trials and Case studies)Clinical researches / clinical trials are approaches to precisely test medication or gadget in patients before it is endorsed by the FDA to be utilized in public. Clinical trials are an important and critical step in our having the capacity to have new medications for diabetes and other varied conditions. A case study is a methodology and a strategy that investigates a phenomenon with its real-life context. Case studies and clinical trials are used to develop or assess the quality of the medications being developed.Cardiovascular issues in DiabetesCardiovascular diseases affects the circulation of blood and poor circulation leads to complications. Diabetes increases the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Reports states, most of the people with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes are having high blood pressure. These complications embrace coronary cardiopathy (CHD), stroke, peripheral blood vessel malady, renal disorder, retinopathy, and probably pathology. Attributable to the aging of the population and an increasing prevalence of obesity and inactive life habits within the prevalence of diabetes is increasing. 68% of people age 65 or older with diabetes die from some of the heart diseases and 16% die of stroke. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than adults without diabetes.Nanotechnology in Diabetes TreatmentNanotechnology holds a great deal of promise for the world of medicine. It is likely that some of the first truly revolutionary changes noticeable in our everyday lives will be brought about by Nano-medicine. the possibilities of Nano-medicine include Nano formulations for efficient drug delivery, smart drugs which only activate when needed, engineered microbes which produce human hormones.Diabetic Nephropathy and UrineDiabetic nephropathy (DN), also known as diabetic kidney disease, is the chronic loss of kidney function occurring in those with diabetes mellitus. Protein loss in the urine due to damage to the glomeruli may become massive, and cause a low serum albumin with resulting generalized body swelling (edema) and result in the nephrotic syndrome. Likewise, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may progressively fall from a normal of over 90 ml/min/1.73m2 to less than 15, at which point the patient is said to have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It usually is slowly progressive over years.Bariatric SurgeryBariatric surgical procedures cause weight loss by restricting the amount of food the stomach can hold, causing malabsorption of nutrients, or by a combination of both gastric restriction and malabsorption. Bariatric procedures also often cause hormonal changes. Most weight loss surgeries today are performed using minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic surgery). The basic principle of bariatric surgery is to restrict food intake and decrease the absorption of food in the stomach and intestines.Pediatric Diabetes and EndocrinologyPediatric or juvenile diabetes is chronic type 1 diabetes which affects the young population, particularly children under the age of 15. Such diabetes brings about lifetime dependency on exogenous insulin. Signs and symptoms of pediatric diabetes are like other types of diabetes and children are more likely to develop the disease if there is a family history of diabetes. Complications of pediatric diabetes also generally include heart diseases, nerve damage, nerve, kidney and eye damage, skin conditions, osteoporosis, etc. Proper diagnosis, treatment and management are the possible remedies for this type of diabetes.Pediatric Endocrinology is a subspecialty of pediatrics dealing with metabolic and endocrine disorders in children. The most common disease of the speciality is type 1 diabetes , which usually accounts for at least 50% of a typical clinical practice. The next most common problem is growth disorders , especially those amenable to growth hormone treatment. Pediatric endocrinologists are usually the primary physicians involved in the medical care of infants and children with intersex disorders. It also deals with hypoglycaemia and other forms of hyperglycemia in childhood, variations of puberty as well other adrenal, thyroid and pituitary problems.Physiotherapy in diabetesDiabetes became a serious and deadly disease mainly because of obesity and poor lifestyle. Although diabetes can be prevented, treated, controlled, and the risk lessened via various health and lifestyle interventions like physiotherapy. Physiotherapy can be used wisely to diagnosis, treat, and manage musculoskeletal (MSK) manifestations and complications of type 2 diabetes. Physiotherapy mehods like effective exercise, physical conditioning, and active, healthy living can be effective in treating diabetes Stem Cell Therapy in DiabetesIn most cases of stem cell therapy, using one's own stem cells is more more helpful for the exocrine gland to regenerate and boost its ability to produce insulin. Procedure continues to achieve success, with patients experiencing health advantages even six months after stem cell diabetes treatment. Repeated applications of adipose stem cells is one of the most effective treatment for type two diabetes, providing an open window to create dietary changes, supplementation and exercise much more effective for long-term management of blood glucose. Diabetic RetinopathyDiabetic retinopathy is a condition or disease of eye that is found in patients with Diabetes. This can be once high blood glucose levels cause injury to blood vessels within the membrane. These blood vessels will swell and leak. Or they'll shut, stopping blood from passing through. generally abnormal new blood vessels grow on the membrane. All of those changes will steal your vision.Cardiovascular risks in obeseObesity not only increases the cardiovascular risks but it damages more than just the heart and blood system. It is also the major cause of bile stones, osteoarthritis and respiratory problems. Obesity closely interferes with many health conditions that underlie cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, diabetes and abnormal blood cholesterol. Additionally, weight gain is a frequent consequence of a heart-damaging lifestyle such as lack of exercise and a fat diet. Obesity can also lead to Cardiac arrest. This is a serious condition when the heart is unable to pump enough amount of blood to satisfy the body's requirement. Obesity and Metabolic syndromeObesity is dirctly or indirctly linked to some endocrine diseases, including basic ones such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovarian syndrome to rare ones such as Cushing's syndrome, central hypothyroidism, and hypothalamic disorders. Mechanisms to upgrade weight shift in as per endocrine condition. Hypothyroidism is related to the combination of hyaluronic acid in different tissues, extra liquid preservation due to reduced cardiovascular yield and reduced thermogenesis. The net abundance of androgen gives the impression of being urgent in the progression of central obesity. In Cushing's syndrome, association with thyroid and developmental hormones plays a significant part in increasing adipocyte separation and adipogenesis. This audit also depicts remaining rare cases: hypothalamic obesity due to central hypothyroidism and combined hormone deficiencies.Diabetes and cancerDiabetes and cancer are two of the biggest threats with tremendous impact to humans during this decade. However scientists are yet to prove a relation between the two. Recent studies show some evidences however not definite proofs that some diabetes treatment methods increases the danger of cancer. Instances from the recent studies includes anti-diabetics, the foremost usually used anti-diabetic drug, appears to lower cancer risk. however there is conjointly proof from some studies conducted by others that hypoglycemic agent, notably long hypoglycemic agent glargine (Lantus), could increase cancer risk. Diabetes in young adultsResearches states that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are on the rise among young adults. Current estimates suggest that up to 3 million youth and adults in the United States are living with type 1 diabetes . A report on Diabetes in Youth found that newly diagnosed cases of Type 2 diabetes in children and teens increased by about 4.8 percent in each year of the study's period between 2002 and 2012. Gestational Diabetes The short term occurrence of diabetes in pregnant ladies is majorly known as Gestational diabetes. It is seen in non- diabetic mothers suddenly develops diabetes during pregnancy and the symptoms disappears after the baby's birth.Diabetic NeuropathyThe damage caused to nerves by diabetes is called Diabetic neuropathy. The main cause of this damage is the pressure generated due to high blood glucose levels in the blood for a very long time and high levels of fats, such as triglycerides in the blood. Symptoms vary with the type of diabetic neuropathy.Mainly diabetic neuropathy is divided into 4 types namely;Peripheral neuropathyAutonomic neuropathyRadiculoplexus neuropathyMononeuropathyDiabetes and DementiaDementia being called the disorder due to a result of trauma or brain illness can be connected to diabetes mellitus as mentioned in some of the studies. Although not much is known about the connection between dementia and diabetes mellitus. Dementia is the term used to specify the mind disease where the capacity recall and to think diminish along. These brain diseases affect capacity and a person's rituals to execute. The changes is unnoticeable and small, but becomes severe. The case arises when diseases like strokes or Alzheimers impact the mind. Even though Alzheimers has been counted as the most important reason behind dementia, other potential cases to remain.Diabetes Wound CareWound healing gets slow in diabetic patients due to a number of factors such as High blood sugar levels (When your blood sugar level is higher than normal, it prevents nutrients and oxygen from energizing cells which prevents your immune system from functioning efficiently and eventually increases inflammation in the body's cells. Diabetes ManagementAlong with prevention and treatment, management is very important and plays a crucial role in diabetes. . Management of diabetes mainly aims to minimize the risk of long-term consequences associated with diabetes. It not only involves keeping a check on blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels but also focusing on modern approaches like exercise, dietary and lifestyle management often coupled with on-going blood glucose level monitoring. Besides this, self-management of diabetes is also very crucial for the proper adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications.Diabetes and Mental HealthUntreated mental state problems can make diabetes worse, and issues with diabetes will build mental state problems worse. however if one starts recovering, the other will start recovering too. The main set of mental health problems in Diabetes includes-Latest Techniques In Diabetes DiagnosisThe concept of 'new technologies' for type 1 diabetes and new discovery and advanced type 2 diabetes treatment has expanded in recent years at a rate that some might consider comparable to 'Moore's Law', and the sheer number of new technologies entering into the type 1 diabetes marketplace is also growing at a remarkable rate. From the patient's perspective, this is not only exciting but can lead to a sense of optimism. Technologies that today are growing commonplace. come under new therapeutic mechanisms of diabetes. Indeed, it could be argued that the major advances in type 1 diabetes care made within the last quarter of a century have come from technology rather than biology. Previous Conference ReportEuroscicon conference ""3rd World Congress on Diabetes and Obesity"" formally Diabetes Conference 2019 was held in Holiday inn Rome Aurelia | Rome, Italy during 18-19 March, 2019 with active participation of professional researchers, scientists involved in the development of high-quality education &amp; research in all aspects.Diabetes Conference 2019 witnessed an amalgamation of peerless speakers who enlightened the crowd with their knowledge and confabulated on various topics related to the field of Diabetes and Obesity.

We take immense pleasure to get the opportunity to host the next edition of our congress in during November 06-07, 2019 in Chicago, USA. This time we have planned to organize a better and bigger congress that will include various aspects of researches that left unfocussed in our last edition.Let us meet again @chicago Market ResearchAs per the studies conducted recently, there are more than twenty-seven million diabetes patients within the U.S.A., thus world's third largest country in terms of diabetes patients in 2018. The major reasons behind these prevailing cases of diabetes is the rise of obesity levels associated with the increasing aging population. It's been found in the studies conducted that over half the U.S.A. population is either obese or overweight that is especially because of their inactive lifestyles, physical inactivities and unhealthy consumption habits. Moreover, the aging population within the U.S.A. has been on the increase since the 1960's. individuals aged sixty five years and on top of accounted for around 11th of September of the overall population in 1960 whereas in 2018, this cohort accounted for around 15 August 1945 of the whole U.S.A. population. Driven by rising incidences of polygenic disorder and therefore the incontrovertible fact that the U.S.A. has one amongst the very best per capita tending expenditures, the U.S.A. marketplace for polygenic disorder medication has grownup at a CAGR of around eleven.8% throughout 2011-2018, reaching a price of US$ forty five.4 Billion in 2018.Diabetes has increasingly become a lifestyle related disease as it afflicts young and old. As the number of patients grow across the globe, there has never been a stronger and more urgent need for novel therapeutic measures in clinical and preclinical evaluation, that arrest the growth of the disease. The diabetes market, consisting mainly of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is large and growing significantly. Global diabetes market is expected to grow at CAGR of 7.6% for the forecasted period of 2018-2023.the market is segmented on the basis of type of diabetes, drugs class and diabetic devices. Diabetic drugs have the highest market share amongst drugs and devices and are also expected to have the highest growth rate with a CAGR of 8.9% . some of the top selling diabetic drugs include Lantus(sanofi), Januvia(Merck and Co), Humalog(Eli Lily And Co),Novo rapid(Novo Nordisk),Levemir(Novo Nordisk),Victoza(Novo Nordisk),Janumet(Merck And Co),Novolog(Novo Nordisk),Humalin (Eli Lily And Co) and Galvus (Novartis).with the diabetic population expected to cross the 350 million market by 2030 the market is expected to show strong growth rate. Diabetic drugs are highly priced which could be one of the major drawbacks.Diabetes drug research market in Europe is expected to progress with a 5.08% CAGR over the forecast years of 2018-2026. It is the second largest market for diabetes drugs. High blood glucose kills about 3.4 million people annually worldwide. Approximately 80% of these deaths take place in underdeveloped and developing countries, and almost half are people aged less than 70 years. As per recent research in WHO diabetic deaths will double between 2005 and 2030. India had 69.2 million people living with diabetes (8.7%) in 2015. About 90% of the patients are suffering from Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Research Market is expected to grow at the average CAGR of 6.5% time period of 2016-2023. India's Diabetes Market is growing rapidly. India is expected to grow US$ 7441.6 million by 2023 from US$ 4778.7 million in 2016. The data varies from $263 billion spent in North America to $147 billion in Europe and Northern Asia. Followed by China, Mongolia, South East Asia and Oceania with a total of $88 billion. Why Chicago?As per reports, over 1,300,000 people in Illinois have diabetes or 12.8% of the population. Illinoisans are increasingly feeling the effects of diabetes. In 2018, reports states USA as third largest country worldwide in terms of diabetes patients. The increasing rate of diabetes patients are expected to grow more in coming years demands new advancements in research thus producing a bigger market for diabetes related products/procedures.Societies Associated with Diabetes Research: SBDR - Society for Biomedical Diabetes Research Austrian Diabetes Association Flemish Diabetes Association Association of Juvenile Diabetes Canadian Diabetes Association Juvenile Diabetes Foundation of Chile German Diabetes Union Diabetic Society of Singapore Japan Diabetes Society Hong Kong Diabetes Federation The International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology Royal Society of Medicine Endocrinology and Diabetes Section International Society of Psych neuroendocrinology International Neuroendocrine Federation European Society of Endocrinology Clinical Endocrinology Trust Swiss Diabetes Society Spanish Diabetes Society Korean Diabetes AssociationDiabetic Research Centers World wide:University of Michigan Albert Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes CenterBoston AreaColumbia UniversityIndiana UniversityJohns Hopkins University/University of MarylandJoslin Diabetes Center - Harvard Medical SchoolStanford UniversityUniversity of Alabama at BirminghamUCSD-UCLAUCSFUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of MichiganUniversity of PennsylvaniaUniversity of WashingtonWashington UniversityVanderbilt UniversityYale UniversityAlbert Einstein College of MedicineEmory UniversityKaiser Foundation Research InstituteUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of ColoradoInternational Diabetes Federation, UAEPublic Health Research Center, Abu Dhabi, UAEImperial College London Diabetes Centre, UAEGlobal Diabetes Research Centre, India.Diabetes Research Center, PUMCH, ChinaCenter for Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, JapanLeicester Diabetes Centre, United KingdomGarvan Institute of Medical Research, AustraliaPersatuan Diabetes Indonesia Research CentreDiabetic Hospitals Across the world:Mayo Clinic – Rochester, MNCleveland Clinic – Cleveland, OH Massachusetts General Hospital – Boston, MAJohns Hopkins Hospital – Baltimore, MDUCSF Medical Center – San Francisco, CANew York-Presbyterian University Hospital of Columbia and Cornell – New York, NYYale-New Haven Hospital – New Haven, CTNorthwestern Memorial Hospital – Chicago, ILUCLA Medical Center – Los Angeles, CAUniversity of Washington Medical Center – Seattle, WAHospitals of the University of Pennsylvania-Penn Presbyterian – Philadelphia, PABrigham and Women's Hospital – Boston, MAFlorida Hospital Orlando – Orlando, FLCedars-Sinai Medical Center – Los Angeles, CABarnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University – St. Louis, MOBeaumont Hospital – Grosse Pointe, MIMount Sinai Hospital – New York, NYFroedtert Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin – Milwaukee, WILancaster General Hospital – Lancaster, PAUniversity of Kansas Hospital – Kansas City, KSKEM Hospital, PuneLakeshore Hospital &amp; Research Center, KochiAll India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), DelhiM.V.

Increasing Insulin Affordability,"An Endocrine Society Position StatementPrint PDFINTRODUCTIONInsulin is a lifesaving medication for people with diabetes. However, its cost has nearly tripled in the past fifteen years making it difficult for many patients to afford this medication and effectively manage their disease.1 This has put patient safety in jeopardy as patients opt to ration their insulin or forgo other medical care. Research indicates that a lack of transparency in the drug supply chain has made it challenging to identify the root cause of price increases. This position statement will identify barriers to accessing affordable insulin and potential policy solutions that could address this growing problem. BACKGROUNDMore than 30 million Americans have diabetes with another 84 million at risk for developing the disease.2 Having diabetes increases one's risk for serious health problems including heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, amputations, and death.3 Diabetes is also the most expensive chronic condition in the United States.4 Average medical expenses are 2.3 times higher for people with diabetes.5 In 2017, the cost of diagnosed diabetes was estimated to be $327 billion annually, with $237 billion in direct medical costs.6This equates to one-in-four health care dollars being spent on people with diagnosed diabetes.7 And since one-in-four are unaware they have the disease8, costs to the healthcare system are even higher than estimated.Given the complex nature of diabetes, it is essential that patients adhere to their medication regimen to avoid unnecessary complications and hospitalizations. However, adherence can be difficult as people with diabetes often have co-morbidities that require them to take multiple, costly medications or they may be unable to make sustained lifestyle changes that could improve outcomes. One study indicates that improved adherence among people with diabetes could prevent nearly 700,000 emergency department visits, 341,000 hospitalizations and save $4.7 billion annually.9 Recent increases in drug costs and changes to insurance design are some of the most common reasons for poor medication adherence, particularly for patients on insulin.10,11Rising Insulin CostsThe true cost of insulin can be difficult to pinpoint because of a lack of transparency in financial agreements between stakeholders in the supply chain, geographical differences in cost, and insurance coverage.12 From 2001-2016, the list price of Novolog, a commonly used insulin, increased by 353% per vial.13 Humulin U500 increased from $170to more than $1,400 since 1987.14 From 2001-2015, the price of Humalog increased 585% for a vial of insulin.15 GoodRx.com, a website that aggregates claims data to estimate the average list price of medications (the price of insulin without the negotiated discounts or rebates), published cost information per vial (1000 units) for commonly prescribed insulins in August 2018. The following prices are averaged from Walgreens and CVS pharmacies:Lantus: $302Humalog: $322Novolog: $336Humulin N: $180Novolin N: $155Basaglar: $261*Levemir: $394Toujeo: $338*Humulin R: $180Novolin R: $155Humulin 70/30: $177Novolin 70/30: $156Novolog 70/30: $338Humalog 75/25: $351Tresiba: $388*Apidra: $368Admelog: $254*cost based on conversion to 1000 unitsCurrently, 7.4 million Americans use insulin to treat their diabetes.16 At minimum, these patients use one vial of insulin each month. However, some patients require multiple vials of insulin or use multiple types of insulins (which necessitates multiple vials) each month. According to a survey conducted by the American Diabetes Association, 27 percent of respondents stated that insulin costs have affected their past year purchase or use of insulin. Thirty-four percent of families with children on insulin were impacted.17 Those affected by rising costs were more likely to experience adverse health effects than those for whom cost did not impact their purchase or use of insulin and twice as likely to experience negative emotions like stress and anxiety. Many of these patients were also forced to forgo other needs such as transportation (32%), utilities (30%), housing (27%), doctor's visits (32%), or other medications (36%)18, and were more likely to ration their insulin.Patient Cost-SharingInsurance plan design directly impacts out-of-pocket costs. Patients who are uninsured pay the list price of insulin. These individuals may be eligible for a manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance program (PAP), however, these programs are restrictive, difficult to navigate, and it is unclear how many patients are able to utilize them.Patients on some forms of commercial plans may need to pay full price, depending on the plan design, for their insulin until they meet an annual deductible and then pay a fixed co-pay. They may also be required to pay co-insurance, a percentage of the cost based on the list price of insulin that does not include rebates or discounts negotiated by the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).For patients with high-deductible plans (plans with a deductible greater than $1,350 for an individual or $2,700 for a family), out-of-pocket insulin costs are significant. Individuals must pay for the full list price of insulin until they meet their annual deductible. In 2016, approximately 40% of Americans had a high-deductible health plan with an average annual deductible of $4,358 for individual health plans and $7,983 for family plans.19 In the same year, 44% reported selecting plans with annual deductibles of $6,000 or greater in 2016.20Medicare beneficiaries with Part D coverage without a supplemental plan must also pay full price for insulin until they meet their deductible, after which point they will pay co-insurance until meeting their plan's initial coverage limit for prescription drugs ($3,750 in 2018).21 At this point, they experience the Part D ""donut hole"", a coverage gap between the plan's initial coverage limit and when catastrophic coverage kicks in. While Medicare beneficiaries are in the donut hole, they will pay 35% of the plan's cost for covered brand-name prescription drugs until reaching their annual out-of-pocket limit of $5,000 in true out-of-pocket spending. Catastrophic coverage will then begin, and the Medicare beneficiary will pay a small co- insurance or copayment for covered prescription drugs.22In some cases, purchasing medications outside of their pharmacy benefit allows patients to pay lower costs. So-called ""gag rules"" have prevented pharmacists from counseling patients about options to take advantage of this cost-savings and should be eliminated.There are many stakeholders across the drug supply chain who influence rising costs, including wholesalers, PBMs, pharmacies, health plans, and employers. While manufacturers establish the list price, each of these players impact the out-of-pocket cost to a patient on insulin through a complex series of negotiations and rebates not transparent to the public. The lack of transparency makes it difficult, if not impossible, to understand how much each stakeholder gains when costs to the patient increase. Research indicates that while list prices have skyrocketed, the net price increase that manufacturers earn has risen at a far slower rate (3-36% net increases).23 Increasing transparency is critical to understand this divergence and other contributors to rising insulin costs.CONSIDERATIONSComplexity of the Supply ChainThe complexity of the supply chain makes it difficult to pinpoint the drivers behind increasing insulin prices. Manufacturers set the list price for the medication and typically sell their medications to wholesalers or PBMs. The process to get the medication from the manufacturer to the patient is rather straightforward, but the flow of money and the methodology to establish the price that the patient ultimately pays is much more complex. The net price manufacturers receive is based on the list price minus any fees paid to the wholesaler, discounts paid to the pharmacy, and rebates paid to the PBMs or health plans. Financial agreements between the stakeholders are confidential. For example, manufacturers are not privy to the PBM's negotiations with the health plans.Despite significant financial incentives negotiated between the stakeholders in the supply chain, most of these savings are never shared with the consumer. As such, an individual's cost is largely based on the list price. As list prices grow at double-digit rates, people with high-deductible plans, co-insurance, or no insurance suffer the effects.Net PriceThe process to establish the net price involves the exchange of rebates, discounts and other payments to encourage the purchase of a drug. For example, a manufacturer may offer distributor volume discounts to purchase their drug or provide financial incentives to a PBM for placement on the preferred tier of their drug formulary. Manufacturers cite these financial incentives as a major driver of high list prices; the more incentives provided to the players across the supply chain, the higher the list price must be for the manufacturer to realize any profit. In theory, the rebates offered to a PBM to place the drug on their preferred formulary tier should reduce costs for the patient. However, these rebates may be used by the employer or the health plan to reduce insurance premiums, not the cost of the drug at point-of-sale. However, due a lack of transparency, it is unclear the extent to which premiums are actually affected.Patient Assistance Programs and Discount CardsTo address high out-of-pocket costs, manufacturers offer patient assistance programs (PAPs) that provide insulin at low or no cost to low-income patients who qualify. These requirements vary by company and patients must apply annually which can be problematic as PAPs can be difficult to navigate. Manufacturers also offer co-pay cards but these are typically used to incentivize the use of higher cost medications and have been shown to result in overall higher medication prices. Lower-cost AlternativesCompetition in the marketplace for both brand name and generics typically drives down prices. This has not been the case with insulin. The price of modern insulins has continued to increase despite the availability of multiple competing insulins on the market. In a true free-market economy, this should promote greater competition and drive down costs. Human insulins (i.e., NPH and regular insulins) have been available for decades, would be an effective therapy for some patients with Type 2 Diabetes, and can still be purchased at a significantly lower cost. However, most health care providers are no longer trained on how to use these.Value-based PurchasingSome experts believe that value-based purchasing (VBP) agreements have the potential to reduce drug costs. These agreements between manufacturers and health plans base payment on how effective a medication is at treating a disease and can be structured in different ways; if a drug does not improve outcomes or leads to poorer health among the health plan's patient population, the manufacturer will provide discounts, rebates, or refunds to the health plan. However, further research is needed to understand whether value-based purchasing agreements will reduce patient costs. Furthermore, regulatory barriers have limited the number of existing VBP contracts, thereby making it difficult to assess the real benefit of value-based purchasing on reducing drug costs.POSITIONSRising costs have made access to affordable insulin far more difficult for people with diabetes, especially low- income individuals, those on high deductible health plans, Medicare beneficiaries in the Part D donut hole, or those who are uninsured. Addressing insulin affordability is critical in ensuring that patients can effectively manage their diabetes and avoid unnecessary complications and hospitalizations. For many patients with diabetes, insulin is a life-saving medication. Policymakers should address drivers of rising insulin prices and implement solutions that would reduce high out-of-pocket expenditures for patients.The Endocrine Society believes the following policy and practice changes could help expand access to lower cost insulin.Greater transparency is needed across the supply chain to understand rising insulin costsFuture list price increases should be limited and reasonable financial incentives should be pursued by all stakeholders.To reduce out-of-pocket expenditures, cost-sharing should be limited to a co-pay. In addition, NPH and regular insulin should be available at no cost to the patient.Rebates should be passed along to consumers without increasing premiums or deductibles.Patient Assistance Programs should less restrictive and expanded to include more accessible and easier to complete applications that can be used for multiple programs (e.g. a common application).Health care providers should be trained to use lower-cost human insulins (e.g., NPH and regular), so they can prescribe as appropriate.When clinically equivalent options are available, physicians should consider prescribing the lowest cost insulin.The Federal government should address regulatory barriers to create a more favorable environment for the testing of incentive programs that reduce cost and improve care (e.g. value-based purchasing agreements).Electronic medical records should include up-to-date formulary and price information.Co-pay savings cards should be eliminated as they have been shown to incentivize the use of higher cost medications and raise the overall cost of drugs.Patients should be educated about low-income assistance programs (e.g. the Extra Help program under Medicare) and to ask their physicians about alternatives if they cannot afford their insulin.Gag rules, which prevent pharmacists from helping patients find less expensive ways to pay for their medications, should be eliminated.Hua X, Carvalho N, Tew M, Huang ES, Herman WH, Clarke P.

Insulin Therapy for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Does Not Fully Protect Offspring From Diet-Induced Metabolic Disorders,"AbstractGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of metabolic disorders in offspring in later life. Although mounting evidence suggests that therapy for GDM could improve neonatal health, whether the therapy confers long-term metabolic benefits to offspring in their later adult lives is not known. Here, using a mouse model of diabetes in the latter half of pregnancy to mimic human GDM, we find that the efficient insulin therapy for GDM confers significant protection against glucose intolerance and obesity in offspring fed a normal chow diet. However, the therapy fails to protect offspring when challenged with a high-fat diet, especially for male offspring. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of pancreatic islets from male offspring identified hypermethylated regions in several genes that regulate insulin secretion, including Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 that encode KATP or Ca2+ channels, which are associated with reduced gene expression and impaired insulin secretion. This finding suggests a methylation-mediated epigenetic mechanism for GDM-induced intergenerational glucose intolerance. It highlights that even efficient insulin therapy for GDM is insufficient to fully protect adult offspring from diet-induced metabolic disorders.IntroductionGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as glucose intolerance first diagnosed during pregnancy, affects up to 15% of pregnancies in the world (1). GDM is associated with adverse consequences not only during fetal development, such as stillbirth, visceromegaly, and macrosomia, but also later in life (2,3). Accumulating evidence suggests that GDM, independent of maternal obesity and genetic background, predisposes offspring to metabolic disorders in later life, such as obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes (4–6). Longitudinal studies of GDM offspring indicate that the maternal glucose level is a strong predictor of altered carbohydrate metabolism during childhood, which can be extended into adulthood (7,8).The therapeutic management of GDM is critical to minimize these complications. Glycemic control is the cornerstone of GDM management (9). Randomized trials have confirmed that the therapy for GDM confers immediate benefits, such as reduction of perinatal complications and prevalence of macrosomia (10,11). However, whether the therapy for GDM confers long-term metabolic benefits to offspring is still unclear (12,13). Importantly, the appropriate offspring follow-up period for assessing the effects of GDM therapy is still debatable. Offspring enrolled in most follow-up studies were prepubertal (age 5–10 years), yet the long-term effect of GDM on offspring metabolic disorders or its reduction through therapy might not be evident until adolescence or adulthood (12,14).In addition, offspring sex also has a profound effect. Sexual dimorphism in the response to insult in utero presents with an uneven disease susceptibility: although both sexes can be affected, one is more susceptible (15). Metabolic differences exist between male and female fetuses (15), and differing sensitivities to maternal hyperglycemia may result in sex-specific disease risks later in life (6,16). Evidence from epidemiological studies demonstrates that the effect of therapy for GDM also differs with fetal sex in infancy and childhood (11,16). Therefore, fetal sex may influence the effect that therapy for GDM has on offspring long-term health. Moreover, social and environmental factors could also confound the follow-up results. Thus, whether therapy for GDM is a modifiable risk factor for offspring metabolic disorders remains unknown.Mechanistically, epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs, provide a plausible link between environmental exposures early in development and the susceptibility to diseases later in life (17). DNA methylation, the most studied epigenetic modification, can alter the status of gene expression and be inherited mitotically in somatic cells (17,18), which provides a potential mechanism by which environmental effects on the epigenome could have long-term effects on gene expression. Results from animal and human studies support that intrauterine hyperglycemia could result in altered fetal DNA methylation patterns and subsequent changes in the risk of developing disease (6,19). In epidemiological and experimental studies, glycemic control improved GDM neonatal outcomes. However, no studies investigated whether these positive effects were accompanied by a favorable restoration of DNA methylation (20), which may be critically important for the susceptibility to disease later in life. Thus, the possibility that fetal metabolic programming in GDM can have long-term effect on health that may in turn be modified by therapy for GDM remains open to question.Because excluding the confounders and analyzing the underlying mechanisms in humans is difficult, we established a mouse model of diabetes in the latter half of pregnancy to mimic human GDM with a high incidence during the third trimester of gestation (21). We treated maternal hyperglycemia with insulin and evaluated the pancreatic islet β-cell function in offspring. We also addressed whether lifestyle factors in adulthood, such as a high-fat diet (HFD), may increase the risk of developing metabolic disorders in offspring. Finally, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing in offspring pancreatic islets and assessed the alterations of candidate genes that may contribute to metabolic phenotypes in offspring.Research Design and MethodsAnimal CareThe Zhejiang University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. All experiments were performed with Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice (22), which were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. (Shanghai, China). Virgin ICR females (age, 6–8 weeks; weight, 26–28 g) were mated with normal ICR males. Pregnancy was dated by the presence of a vaginal plug (day 0.5). Pregnant females were randomly assigned to control (Ctrl), GDM, or GDM + insulin therapy (INS) groups. On day 6 and day 12 of pregnancy, GDM and INS dams were fasted 8 h and received a streptozotocin (STZ) injection (100 mg/kg i.p.) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (23,24) (Fig. 1A). Control pregnant mice received an equal volume of citrate buffer. Blood glucose level was measured via the tail vein 48–72 h after the second STZ injection, and diabetes was defined as a blood glucose level between 14 and 19 mmol/L (6).Figure 1 Experimental design, offspring growth curves, and glucose tolerance.

G: ITT in 20-week-old F1 male offspring (nCtrl-F1_NCD = 6, nINS-F1_NCD = 8, nGDM-F1_NCD = 6, nCtrl-F1_HFD = 8, nINS-F1_HFD = 9, nGDM-F1_HFD = 10). H: ITT in 20-week-old F1 female offspring (nCtrl-F1_NCD = 5, nINS-F1_NCD = 6, nGDM-F1_NCD = 5, nCtrl-F1_HFD = 6, nINS-F1_HFD = 7, nGDM-F1_HFD = 8). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05 vs. Ctrl-F1; **P &lt; 0.01 vs. Ctrl-F1. #P &lt; 0.05 vs. INS-F1; ##P &lt; 0.01 vs. INS-F1 (ANOVA).INS dams were treated with recombinant insulin (Novolin R; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) by miniosmotic pumps (Alzet model 1007D; Durect, Cupertino, CA) at a dose of 0.35 IU/day. Pumps were implanted in INS dams on day 14.5 or 15 of pregnancy posterior to the scapulae under Avertin (Sigma-Aldrich) anesthesia (0.1 mL/20 g body wt). Control and GDM dams were implanted with pumps containing normal saline. To maintain stable glycemic levels, INS dams received another injection of 0.1 units of long-acting insulin (Levemir; Novo Nordisk) ∼1 h before the fed state (darkness) during late gestation. Only mice with nearly normal blood glucose levels in INS group were included in the further study.At birth, litter size was equalized to eight. Pups from the GDM and INS groups were fostered by normal females until the age of 3 weeks. Offspring were designated as Ctrl-F1, GDM-F1, and INS-F1. At 8 weeks of age, offspring were divided into two groups either receiving a normal chow diet (NCD) or HFD (60% energy as fat; D12492; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) until 20 weeks (Fig. 1A).In Vivo Metabolic TestingIntraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (2 g/kg body wt) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) (0.8 unit/kg body wt) were performed in unrestrained conscious mice after a 16- and 4 h-fast, respectively. Serum insulin level was assessed at overnight fasted state and 30 min after the glucose injection (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL).Serum AnalysisSerum cholesterol, triglyceride, nonesterified fatty acids, HDL, and LDL were assayed using a biochemical analyzer (TBA120FR; Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Serum leptin was determined by radioimmunoassay (North Institute, Beijing, China). HOMA-insulin resistance (IR) was calculated as follows: fasting serum insulin concentration (μU/mL) multiplied by fasting blood glucose level (mg/dL) divided by 405 (25).Islet Isolation and In Vitro Insulin SecretionPancreatic islets were isolated from 20-week-old mice as previously described (26). For the indicated experiment, 10 islets (size-matched for each batches) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 2.8 mmol/L glucose and then incubated in the modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing indicated glucose or various chemical compounds, including 200 μmol/L tolbutamide (Sigma-Aldrich), 250 μmol/L diazoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μmol/L Bay K8644 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 μmol/L nifedipine (Sigma-Aldrich). The supernatant was collected for insulin content assay (Abnova, Taipei, China).The pancreata of fetal mice at embryonic day 17 was directly digested in 2 mg/mL collagenase with shaking incubation at 37°C for 25 min. After recovering overnight in RPMI medium, fetal islets were handpicked under a stereomicroscope and randomly separated into 5.6 mmol/L, 16.7/5.6 mmol/L, and 16.7 mmol/L glucose groups (Fig. 6A).Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation SequencingMale offspring fed the NCD were chosen at 20 weeks of age for methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) analysis. Genomic DNA of pancreatic islets was extracted from nine mice per group and pooled by each of the three. The MeDIP-seq was performed as described previously (27). Briefly, DNA was sonicated to obtain the DNA fragments (200–700 base pairs). Sonicated genomic DNA was denatured and immunoprecipitated with anti–5-methylcytosine antibody (#28692; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Illumina libraries were then created from the captured DNA by TruSeq DNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 system (Illumina).Gene ExpressionTotal RNA from isolated pancreatic islets was extracted by using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized using oligo-deoxythymidylic acid and random primers (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) for real-time quantitative PCR with SYBR green detection (TaKaRa). The primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 1.DNA MethylationGenomic DNA was extracted from islets by using the TIANmap Micro DNA kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). Bisulfite was converted using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The methylation status of gene promoter regions was analyzed by pyrosequencing (28). In brief, pyrosequencing primers were designed by Qiagen PyroMark Assay Design 2.0 software (Qiagen) (Supplementary Table 2). The specificity of each PCR product was checked by agarose gel analysis. Pyrosequencing was conducted on a PyroMark Q24 pyrosequencer (Qiagen) by using PyroMark Gold Q24 reagents (Qiagen), and quantification of methylated and unmethylated alleles were performed by PyroMark Q24 software (Qiagen).Immunofluorescence AnalysisFetal islets were identified by detecting insulin with immunofluorescence as previously described (29). Isolated fetal islets were incubated with antibody against insulin. All immunofluorescence images were acquired by laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The antibodies used are described in Supplementary Table 3.Western BlotsThe protein was extracted from mouse islets as described before (29). Samples were separated using 8% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed using polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and the antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 3. Protein bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce, Rockford, IL).STZ-Injected Nondiabetic ModelThe identical amount of STZ was injected in pregnant mice as described above. Only a glucose level of &lt;7.5 mmol/L was considered as an STZ-injected nondiabetic model. Offspring were fostered by normal females until 3 weeks old. Mice were fed the HFD, and glucose tolerance test, and ITT were performed as described above. Islets from the STZ-injected nondiabetic offspring were isolated for further analysis.Statistical AnalysisAll data are shown as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis were performed by one-way ANOVA, followed by least significant difference post hoc test and two-tailed Student t test, as described in the table and figure legends, using SPSS 17.0 software. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsInsulin Therapy for GDM Conferred Offspring a Partial Protection From Metabolic DisordersWe established a mouse model of hyperglycemia during the midlate stage of pregnancy. GDM dams were averaging a 328.6 mg/dL plasma glucose level after two STZ injections. Blood glucose level declined and averaged 129.5 mg/dL during insulin therapy in the INS group (Fig. 1B). Gestational length, litter size, and birth weight were similar among the three groups (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1).Notably, increased body weight and most metabolic abnormalities were seen in GDM-F1 adult offspring (Fig. 1C and D and Table 1). Insulin therapy was associated with normal weight trajectory, serum glucose, and lipid metabolism in adult offspring (Fig. 1C and D and Table 1). However, these associations were observed only in NCD offspring. When fed the HFD after 8 weeks of age, a significant increase in body weight (Fig. 1C), fasting insulin levels, and lipid levels was seen in INS-F1 males (Table1). Females in HFD INS-F1 group only exhibited increased body weight compared with HFD Ctrl-F1 females (Fig. 1D).Table 1 Metabolic parameters in F1 offspringInsulin Therapy–Mediated Protection Against Glucose Intolerance in Offspring Was Abolished by HFD Exposure in AdulthoodInsulin therapy for GDM resulted in a distinct rescue of glucose intolerance in INS-F1 male offspring, with only an increase in glucose levels at 60 min after injection (Fig. 1E). But strikingly, the HFD abolished this protection (Fig. 1E). Results of the ITT showed only GDM-F1 male mice exhibited significant impaired insulin sensitivity with aging in the NCD group (Supplementary Fig. 2B and Fig. 1G). However, when challenged with the HFD, not only GDM-F1 males developed much more serious insulin intolerance, but INS-F1 males also exhibited a pronounced impairment of insulin tolerance compared with controls (Fig. 1G). In female offspring, only GDM-F1 females showed an elevation of glucose level at 30 and 120 min after the insulin injection (Fig. 1H).Insulin secretion defects could also contribute to glucose intolerance. We assessed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, GSIS was reduced in both male and female GDM-F1 offspring (Fig. 2A–D). In the INS-F1 group, only males exhibited lower insulin levels in response to the glucose injection (Fig. 2A and B). In vitro, insulin secretory response to 5.6 mmol/L glucose was similar among all groups (Fig. 2E and F); however, islets of GDM-F1 males or females showed impaired insulin secretion when exposed to 16.7 mmol/L glucose (Fig. 2E and F). Defective insulin response to high glucose (16.7 mmol/L) was also seen in INS-F1 males (Fig. 2E). No significant difference was found in INS-F1 females in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, or GSIS (Figs. 1F and H and 2C, D, and F).Figure 2 GSIS.

Global cytosine methylation status was also altered in INS-F1 offspring, and the methylation of 258 upstream2k (8.37%), 237 downstream2k (7.69%), 81 5′UTR (2.63%), 70 3′UTR (2.27%), 745 coding sequence (24.17%), and 1,690 intron element-associated genes (54.83%) was changed, respectively (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table 6). In GDM-F1, there were 1,326 element-associated hypermethylated genes, and 326 were also hypermethylated in INS-F1 islets (Fig. 3C), and there were 1,350 element-associated hypomethylated genes, with 493 also hypomethylated in INS-F1 (Fig. 3D).Figure 3 DNA methylation patterns in pancreatic islets of male offspring.

D: Venn diagram of hypomethylated genes overlapped between G vs. C and I vs. C. E: KEGG analysis of differentially methylated genes associated with type 2 diabetes.KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis showed that the differentially methylated genes in GDM-F1 and INS-F1 mainly encoded the ion channels in islet β-cell and are involved in insulin secretion. These genes selected for validation were Abcc8 (encoding sulfonylurea receptor 1, Sur1, belonged to ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters), Cacna1c (Cav1.2, encoding one subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels with widespread expression in mouse, rat, and human islets β-cells), Cacna1e (Cav2.3, encoding the R-type Ca2+ channel and expressed in rodent and human), and Cacna1g (Cav3.1, encoding T-type Ca2+ current and mainly expressed in NOD mouse, rat, and human) (Fig. 3E). MeDIP-seq data showed that these candidate genes displayed hypermethylation status in GDM and INS offspring islets compared with controls.Insulin Therapy for GDM Did Not Restore the Altered Expression of Ion Channels and the Defective Insulin Secretion in Offspring Pancreatic IsletsThe mRNA and protein levels of Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 were all significantly lower in GDM-F1 and INS-F1 males (Fig. 4A–G). In addition, HFD exposure downregulated Cav1.2 expression in all groups, but GDM-F1 and INS-F1 males showed dramatically decreased expression of Cav1.2 after HFD feeding (Fig. 4B, D, and F). The similar alteration of gene expression was also seen in GDM-F1 females (Supplementary Fig. 3A–C). But in INS-F1 females, only Cav2.3 showed decreased expression (Supplementary Fig. 3C). There was no significant difference in Cav3.1 expression among the groups (data not shown).Figure 4 Ion channels expression and insulin secretion in the pancreatic islets of male offspring. Representative mRNA levels of Abcc8 (A), Cav1.2 (B), and Cav2.3 (C) in islets of 20-week-old male offspring (nCtrl-F1_NCD = 7, nINS-F1_NCD = 6, nGDM-F1_NCD = 8, nCtrl-F1_HFD = 5, nINS-F1_HFD = 6, nGDM-F1_HFD = 6). D–G: Representative protein levels of Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 in islets of 20-week-old male offspring (n = 4 mice per group). H: Tolbutamide (200 μmol/L) stimulated insulin secretion.

Isolated 20-week-old islets, n = 5 mice per group. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05 vs. Ctrl-F1, **P &lt; 0.01 vs. Ctrl-F1; #P &lt; 0.05 vs. INS-F1; §P &lt; 0.05 vs. Ctrl-F1_NCD, §§P &lt; 0.01 vs. Ctrl-F1_NCD (ANOVA).Further, insulin secretion responses to ion channel agonists and inhibitors were tested in the isolated pancreatic islets from male offspring. Tolbutamide, a KATP channel blocker, stimulated insulin release by 5.52-fold in NCD control islets and 5.05-fold in HFD control islets, respectively, but tolbutamide responses were significantly reduced in GDM-F1 and INS-F1 groups (Fig. 4H). Diazoxide, a KATP channel agonist, significantly inhibited insulin secretion in control islets but did not have such a significant effect on GDM-F1 and INS-F1 (Fig. 4I). Bay K8644, an L-type Ca2+ channels agonist, stimulated insulin secretion by 25.18-fold in NCD controls, but islets from GDM-F1 and INS-F1 mice showed decreased insulin secretion by 13.13-fold and 16.35-fold in response to Bay K8644, respectively (Fig. 4J). In addition, HFD exposure reduced the responses to Bay K8644 in control islets, but a more significant decreased insulin secretion was observed in HFD-fed GDM-F1 and INS-F1 islets (Fig. 4J). Nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channels inhibitor, significantly suppressed insulin secretion in control islets, but nifedipine revealed a minor decrement of insulin secretion in INS-F1, and a minimal suppression in GDM-F1 (Fig. 4K). The inhibitory effect of nifedipine on insulin secretion was not significantly affected by HFD exposure, although insulin secretion showed trends to increased levels in GDM-F1 and INS-F1 HFD males (Fig. 4K).Insulin Therapy for GDM Did Not Reverse the Altered DNA Methylation Status in Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 in Offspring Pancreatic IsletsPancreatic islets of 20-week-old offspring were isolated, and pyrosequencing was used to analyze the methylation status of 10 cytosine phosphate guanine (CpGs) of the Abcc8 promoter, CpGs of Cav 1.2 promoter, and 11 CpGs of the Cav 2.3 promoter. The CpGs of Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 showed significantly higher DNA methylation status in islets of GDM-F1 and INS-F1 males (Fig. 5A–C). Compared with GDM-F1 males, altered DNA methylation status in Cav1.2 and Cav2.3 was improved to a different degree in INS-F1 males (Fig. 5B and C). Further, we found that the effect of GDM treatment on DNA methylation in the three target genes with a sex-specific difference (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Notably, maternal glycemic control was associated with a distinct restoration of DNA methylation levels in Abcc8 and Cav1.2 in INS-F1 females (Supplementary Fig. 3D and E) and a moderate hypermethylated level in Cav2.3 promoter regions (Supplementary Fig. 3F). In addition, HFD feeding caused a significantly higher DNA methylated level at Cav1.2 promoter regions in GDM and INS offspring (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 3E), but the effect of the HFD on DNA methylation was not found in Abcc8 and Cav2.3.Figure 5 Analysis of the DNA methylation level in male offspring pancreatic islets by pyrosequencing.

Treating fetal islets with high glucose (16.7 mmol/L) for the entire 6 days significantly increased Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 promoter DNA methylation levels and reduced their gene expression compared with physiological glucose level (5.6 mmol/L) (Fig. 6C and F–H). In the 16.7/5.6 mmol/L group, the increased Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 DNA methylation levels and reduced gene transcription persisted during subsequent culture at 5.6 mmol/L glucose (Fig. 6C and F–H). Moreover, we examined DNA methylation enzyme (Dnmts) and demethylation enzyme (TETs) expression in fetal islets after high glucose exposure. We found that the Dnmt1, but not Dnmt3a/3b, expression level was upregulated in the 16.7 mmol/L and 16.7/5.6 mmol/L groups (Fig. 6D) and that TET2 and TET3, but not TET1, expression levels were also downregulated in 16.7 mmol/L and 16.7/5.6 mmol/L groups (Fig. 6E).Figure 6 Fetal islets experiment in vitro.

In contrast to adult pancreatic β-cells, STZ had no cytotoxic effect on fetal proislets (31). Although STZ does cross the placenta to a limited extent, it is evident that the fetal pancreas does not concentrate this cytotoxic agent (32). Furthermore, STZ's half-life is very short (5–15 min) in vivo (30), but differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells occurs after day 15 of gestation in the mouse (33), implying that a low dose of STZ may not directly act for offspring metabolic dysfunction and alterations in gene expression. To further evaluate STZ's effect on offspring, we collected the nondiabetic pregnant mice administered STZ alone. No significant difference was found with respect to glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity in NCD or HFD offspring between mice administered STZ and the control group (Supplementary Fig. 4). Quantitative PCR analysis also showed no significant changes in ion channel expression in the group injected with STZ (Supplementary Fig. 5).DiscussionIn this study, we provide the first experimental evidence addressing the effects of insulin therapy on the long-term metabolic health of GDM offspring. Insulin therapy resulted in a significant improvement of metabolic disorders in offspring fed the NCD. But importantly, in response to the HFD, the offspring developed significantly exacerbated glucose intolerance, obesity, and insulin resistance. These abnormalities were more obvious in males than in females, suggesting that males might be more vulnerable to the adverse environment. The findings indicate that predisposition to metabolic disorders still persisted in offspring even with efficient insulin therapy for GDM and was significantly enhanced by the HFD challenge.For the offspring with insulin therapy for GDM, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is an early key phenotype with a major contribution from β-cell dysfunctions. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that the offspring exhibited reduced GSIS. Epigenetic modifications provide a plausible link between the intrauterine environment and alterations in gene expression that may lead to a disease phenotype (17). In accordance with the sex differences of phenotypes, the alterations in gene expression and DNA methylation were also more obvious in males than that in females. In the male offspring, MeDIP-seq data of pancreatic islets showed hypermethylated status of genes that regulate insulin secretion, including ion channel genes Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3. Consistently, downregulated expression of Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 and impairment of KATP and L-type Ca2+ channels that mediate insulin secretion were observed. However, the female offspring only exhibited higher DNA methylation and lower expression of Cav2.3, suggesting that at least at the promoter regions of the three target genes, the epigenetic modification of the male fetus might be more sensitive to the intrauterine hyperglycemia than the female fetus.All of the Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 ion channel are important but with different functions in pancreatic islets. In agreement, Abcc8 encodes a regulatory subunit of the KATP channel, coupling the blood glucose level to membrane electricity activity and insulin secretion (34). Abcc8−/− mice display moderate glucose intolerance, and isolated islets from Abcc8−/− mice show impaired first-phase insulin secretion and response to tolbutamide (35). Cav1.2, encoding a subunit of the L-type Ca2+channel, functions as an important role in the Ca2+ entry pathway (36). Pancreatic β-cell–selective Cav1.2 ablation decreases the whole-cell Ca2+ current by only 45% but almost abolishes first-phase insulin secretion and causes glucose intolerance (37). In contrast, Cav2.3 mediates the second phase of insulin secretion, involved in recruiting insulin granules from pools that are not immediately available to release insulin when glucose loaded (38,39). Isolated islets from Cav2.3−/− mice exhibited reduced insulin content but normal GSIS, implying that the Cav2.3-deficiency may be offset by other compensatory mechanisms (40). This may explain the sex-different phenotype in offspring after insulin therapy for GDM. Compared with the obvious glucose intolerance of male offspring, the female offspring with decreased expression of Cav2.3 alone showed normal glucose tolerance and GSIS.Further, in vitro culture confirmed the effect of short high-glucose exposure on Abcc8, Cav1.2, and Cav2.3 gene expression and DNA methylation in fetal islets. Our animal model, together with in vitro culture, provides evidence that early development is sensitive to the extrinsic factors (41) and that short exposure to intrauterine hyperglycemia is sufficient to persistently affect ion channel gene expression and DNA methylation. Although direct transfer of our experimental results to the human situation warrants caution, it is important to recognize that freedom from symptoms is one of the major difficulties with GDM, and the pregnant woman is usually unaware that she has GDM until it is diagnosed at routine prenatal screening (42), suggesting that the fetus might already be exposed to the adverse intrauterine environment and exhibit adaptive changes in the epigenome (43).In addition, the in vitro experiment showed that the altered gene expression of DNA methyl-writing and methyl-erasing enzymes persisted during subsequent normal glucose culture, indicating that other deleterious factors induced by hyperglycemia may also contribute to the sustained epigenetic alterations. Maternal glucose can freely permeate the placenta, and glucose excursions not only cause fetal hyperglycemia but also induce fetal hyperinsulinemia and oxidative stress (44,45). Although insulin therapy for GDM normalized maternal blood glucose level, whether the insulin intervention reversed other adverse factors is unknown. If not, these factors may persist to affect fetal development and epigenetic modifications (45).Conditions in the postnatal environment are also important cues for inducing adult metabolic diseases (46). In our study, HFD exposure exacerbated glucose intolerance. But importantly, this HFD-induced prediabetic state in GDM offspring, whether with insulin therapy or not, was more severe than that observed in control offspring, suggesting that early fetal insult could impair the ability to adapt to an HFD. Extrinsic factors can also affect the epigenome postnatally (46–48). We consistently found that the HFD caused a higher DNA methylation level of Cav1.2. However, compared with control offspring, the pre- and postnatal factors act synergistically to induce a more significant hypermethylated level of Cav1.2 in the offspring with insulin therapy for GDM, which may partly contribute to the exacerbated glucose intolerance after HFD exposure.An additional factor likely to be responsible for the exacerbated glucose intolerance is insulin resistance. Defective insulin secretion and action are two major results of diabetes (49,50). Notably, even with insulin therapy for GDM, insulin resistance arose when the offspring were challenged with the HFD in adulthood. Although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown, it is interesting to note that these offspring in HFD group displayed significant obese phenotypes, suggesting that insulin resistance might be associated with the overweight and lipid metabolism disorders.In summary, our study provides novel experimental evidence about the effects of insulin therapy for GDM on the long-term health of the offspring, revealing that these offspring are still susceptible to metabolic disorders, especially exposed to an adverse postnatal environment. Although our finding was generated in a mouse model, it is important to recognize that even with efficient insulin therapy for GDM, follow-up and lifestyle interventions are still necessary to the offspring during postnatal life. Further, the results show that short exposure to maternal diabetes during early development is sufficient to cause persistent alterations in DNA methylation and expression of genes that regulate insulin secretion, suggesting a methylation-mediated epigenetic mechanism for GDM-induced intergenerational glucose intolerance. These altered epigenetic markers not only partly explained the susceptibility in GDM offspring, but importantly, will also hopefully allow for the early diagnosis and therapy for individuals with a propensity for adult-onset disease. In light of our results, efficacious screenings and more early interventions should be administrated in GDM patients. More importantly, further elucidation of the molecular events that enable, before glycemic control, to result in offspring protection may lead to the development of new approaches for reducing the fetal-originated adult diseases.Article InformationFunding.

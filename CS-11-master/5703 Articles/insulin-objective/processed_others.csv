What Is Insulin Resistance?,"When I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), I did a ton of research on the condition and found that insulin resistance is common among women who have PCOS. Although I knew that insulin resistance was related to elevated blood sugar levels and could lead to type 2 diabetes, I wasn't exactly sure what insulin resistance meant. Were there any symptoms? How can I get it under control? What were the potential health complications?Luckily, I tapped a few experts to weight in on what exactly insulin resistance is and how it can be treated. The good news: an insulin resistance diagnosis doesn't have to foretell diabetes or other chronic disease.Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas to help digest carbohydrates to glucose, so that your cells can absorb glucose to use as energy. It plays a key role in metabolism and blood sugar regulation. ""In insulin resistance, cells and muscles stop absorbing glucose as efficiently and more glucose stays in the blood,"" explained Rebecca Elbaum, RD, CDE. ""The body then needs more insulin to absorb glucose so that it can be delivered to the cells. Eventually, the cells that secrete insulin fail to keep up with the body's need and blood glucose builds up in the blood stream and stays elevated.""This elevated blood sugar can lead to chronic disease and other serious complications such as prediabetes and full-blown type 2 diabetes.And while people who have insulin resistance aren't necessarily more prone to gaining weight, being overweight or obese can cause insulin resistance, explained Kathleen Wyne, MD, endocrinologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. ""Most people who are obese are insulin resistant,"" she said. Other than the likelihood of having insulin resistance from being overweight or obese, the only other physical symptom is acanthosis nigricans, or a dark coloring of the skin on the neck or armpit. If you think you may be at risk for insulin resistance, be sure to visit your doctor; the diagnostic criteria includes being overweight or obese (with a concentration of belly fat), having a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl, hypertension, triglyceride levels of over 150, and low HDL (""good"" cholesterol) at less than 40 for men and less than 50 for women, explained Wyne.Fortunately, treating insulin resistance is pretty straightforward, if not always easy: weight loss, regular exercise, and possibly the medication Metformin to lower blood sugar. ""The best way to reverse [insulin resistance], if it's caught early enough, is through lifestyle modifications,"" said Eduardo Grunvald, MD, program director at UC San Diego's Weight Management Program. ""So just exercise, independent of weight loss, just regular exercise will improve insulin sensitivity."" In addition to working out, losing weight will improve insulin resistance â€"" losing just 15 pounds and keeping it off will slow the progression to diabetes, said Dr. Wyne.

Advice About the High Cost of Insulin,"If you are living with diabetes, you are probably feeling the effects of rising insulin prices. Many people with the condition have skipped or rationed their medicine to save money, which can lead to serious health problems.""This is an issue that anecdotally had come up many times, both in popular media and Dr. Kasia Lipska's work as endocrinologist,"" said Darby Herkert, a researcher in cellular and developmental biology at Yale University and lead author of a recent study on cost-related insulin underuse. The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine. Lipska is an assistant professor of medicine at Yale and another author of the study.In the study, the Yale Diabetes Center surveyed 199 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, asking if they use less insulin than prescribed; try to stretch out insulin; take smaller doses of insulin than prescribed; have stopped using insulin; have not filled an insulin prescription or have not start insulin because of cost. One-quarter of the participants answered yes to at least one question.Who Is Vulnerable to Insulin Skipping and Rationing?Insulin as a diabetes treatment has been around for almost 100 years, yet costs keep rising, and that puts an increasing number of people with low- or middle incomes at risk for skipping and rationing doses.Between 2012 and 2016, the amount the average patient with type 1 diabetes paid for insulin rose from $2,684 to $5,705, according to an analysis by the Health Care Cost Institute. Overall, people living with diabetes have annual health care costs that are 2.3 times higher than people without diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.""I am not sure why cost has increased so dramatically. Increase in overhead of pharmaceutical companies is the only reason I can think of,"" said Veronica Brady, associate professor of endocrinology at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, and spokesperson for the American Association of Diabetes Educators.In addition to pharmaceutical companies, generic drug makers, physicians and the Food and Drug Administration all have played a role in insulin cost increases over the years, and Congress plans to investigate the market, according to a report in STAT.""I suspect, based on conversations, that middle-income patients are hit harder by the 'donut hole' in insurance,"" said Herkert, referring to Medicare and its limits on prescription drug coverage.But even middle-income Americans with employer-sponsored insurance are feeling the squeeze. In the Yale study, roughly 32 percent of participants with health coverage from an employer still struggled with insulin affordability. Almost 43 percent of those with incomes over $50,000 also struggled.Members of the ""sandwich generation,"" that is, people caring for children and an older parent or other family member, could also have more trouble affording insulin. Many of these caregivers are in their 40s and 50s, and the Yale study found that about 24 percent of respondents between the ages of 44 and 64 misused insulin due to struggling with the cost. Misuse was defined as skipping doses, taking smaller doses or stopping insulin.Is it Harmful to Skip Insulin Doses?Skipping insulin doses can be harmful. In the Yale study, patients who misused insulin had a roughly 43 percent rate of poor glycemic control. Those who didn't misuse insulin had about a 28 percent rate of poor glycemic control.""People are placed on diabetes medication if (their bodies) don't make any insulin (type 1) or don't reach targeted blood glucose levels (type 2),"" Brady says. Inadequate insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes can cause them to go into diabetic shock, leading to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Also, a hospital stay will cost far more than the cost of the skipped insulin.While less extreme, inadequate insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes still has significant risks. When blood sugar runs higher, these patients can face changes in vision, increased risk of heart problems and peripheral nerve damage. The vision problems can even lead to blindness.There are other effects, too. Lower blood glucose levels can cause brain fog, making it harder to concentrate at your job. Also, as Brady explains, when blood sugar gets too high, people must avoid strenuous exercise, and a sedentary lifestyle is known to contribute to many other health problems.Finding Less Expensive OptionsPatients struggling to afford insulin should talk to their doctors about the problem, Herkert says. Unfortunately, she says, one-third of patients in the Yale study who had trouble affording medication didn't discuss it with their doctor, which could be due to feelings of embarrassment or isolation.However, as she points out, many people in the U.S. are facing the same struggle, and doctors often can help patients find ways to deal with the problem.Patients should ask their doctors if there is a safe, less expensive alternative to their current prescription. For instance, ""NPH"" insulin usually costs less than ""analog"" insulin — although, these two types have different dosing instructions, so it's important to discuss the options with a physician.Another avenue for help is through the local chapters of the American Diabetes Association. Reach out to see what programs they offer. The association advocates through its Make Insulin Affordable initiative, which shares resources for patients.Compare Insurance Plans and PharmaciesHealth insurance plans are another important consideration. When it's time to pick one at work or through Medicare, people should carefully compare plan costs related to diabetes care.""I encourage patients to make sure insurance covers insulin and testing supplies,"" Brady says. Also, if your insurance plan offers the the option, it's sometimes less expensive to get a 90-day supply of insulin rather than a 30-day supply.In addition, prescription prices vary at retail pharmacies, so it's important to check around. Websites like GoodRx.com or InsideRx.com can help with comparing costs. These sites also offer discount cards, although the discounts can't be used on top of insurance. But, sometimes the discount card price is less expensive than a copay. It also could cost ess than a copay to buy testing supplies in bulk online.Brady also suggests checking into coupons from pharmaceutical companies, which are sometimes available to patients with employer-based insurance.By Danielle Bullen LoveDanielle Bullen Love is a freelance writer from the greater Philadelphia area who specializes in health and wellness content.Next Avenue Editors Also Recommend:Next Avenue brings you stories that are inspiring and change lives.

Schizophrenia Risk and Insulin Resistance Intrinsically Linked,"New research provides more evidence of genetic ties between schizophrenia and insulin resistance and suggests that patients with insulin-resistant schizophrenia may constitute a distinct subgroup with diminished response to antipsychotics medications. ""Because these patients show diminished response to antipsychotic medication, they might require personalized treatment tailored to their endophenotype,"" lead researchers Sabine Bahn, MD, PhD, and Jakub Tomasik, PhD, from University of Cambridge, UK, told Medscape Medical News. The study was published online April 3 in JAMA Psychiatry. Shared Genetic Factors? Patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of impaired glucose metabolism, yet the comorbidity between the two conditions cannot be fully explained by known risk factors such as obesity, smoking, stress, or antipsychotic medication. Previous family and genome-wide studies have suggested that the co-occurrence between schizophrenia and impaired glucose metabolism may be due to shared genetic factors, as illustrated by increased risk of diabetes in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia, but the biological mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. Bahn and colleagues studied the association between insulin resistance, schizophrenia polygenic risk, and response to treatment in 58 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 58 matched healthy individuals while controlling for a range of demographic (age, gender, body mass index), lifestyle (smoking, alcohol and cannabis use) and clinical (psychopathology scores, treatment drug) factors. They found that insulin resistance significantly correlated with schizophrenia polygenic risk score in patients, with higher genetic risk of schizophrenia associated with increased insulin resistance. They also found that patients with higher insulin resistance were more likely to switch antipsychotic medication during the first year of treatment (adjusted odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 - 3.52; P = .02), which implies lower clinical response. ""Future large-scale pharmacogenomic studies in drug-naive patients with longitudinal clinical follow-up will help to further examine the association between insulin resistance, schizophrenia, and antipsychotic treatment response, in addition to determining the effects of other lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise, identifying specific genetic variants underlying shared susceptibility to schizophrenia and insulin resistance, and potentially guiding the development of novel, personalized treatment approaches,"" the investigators said. Alternative Explanations? Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Toby Pillinger, MRCP, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, UK, noted that the study's outcomes are ""consistent with a theory that was first proposed over 100 years ago — that risk of developing both schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes are intrinsically linked."" There are, however, other potential explanations for the outcomes, he noted. ""For example, the influence of diet and exercise was not assessed. Increased genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with worse symptoms and functioning, so you might expect patients with higher polygenic risk scores to have worse diet and reduced exercise levels, which would increase insulin resistance,"" he said. Similarly, the observation of increased insulin resistance predicting nonresponse to treatment may simply be explained, Pillinger said, by patients with more severe symptoms at baseline (which will respond less well to treatment) having poorer lifestyle factors that increase insulin resistance. ""In other words, these outcomes may not actually be directly (intrinsically) related,"" Pillinger said. ""So, while the findings are novel and interesting, future studies need to consider the influence of confounders such as lifestyle before we can make definitive statements regarding intrinsic links and causality."" The study was supported by grants from the Stanley Medical Research Institute. Tomasik was a consultant for Psynova Neurotech Ltd, until April 2016. Bahn is a director of Psynova Neurotech Ltd and Psyomics Ltd. Pillinger has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. JAMA Psychiatry. Published online April 3, 2019.

When you talk too much for Twitter,"@CBS @CBSEveningNews @JeffGlor @AnaWerner #RisingCostOfDiabetesMedicine #Insulin I get it. But I'm going to present some harsh truths that needs to be said. Here's the thing. Just as I said, and it is true, that not all those with Preexisting Conditions shld be treated the same with pricing and premiums, because of irresponsibility, that makes it unfair to the rest of society and to insurance companies to give them the same rates, there is a parallel with this story.The problem with bleeding hearts is that they think as soon as there is anything wrong with a subject, they shld get or have access to anything they want. They dont consider the results or consequences of life and behavior, which cld include sickness and disease, and when it does, those shld pay a higher price, or may, and it be just and fair, more than those who do things right, as best they can, and life just happens, whereas, even then, it's their responsibility, too, and not everyone else's, but Govt and Society do have an obligation to make sure things are reasonable, necessities, especially.With that said, there is more diabetes in this country, more than ever, and certain manageable and preventable diseases and conditions, AND MUCH INFORMATION AVAILABLE about them all, that ppl don't take advantage of, and decide to live and eat however way they choose, and not exercise, and do harm to their own selves, and then the pharmaceutical companies need to accommodate them? I believe there shld be some form of regulations across the board, but when I hear stories like this, I'm not moved to berate the companies profiting off the poor, irresponsible behavior of the masses.Yes. I am aware that not all Diabetics fit in this description. That's why I opened up with preexisting conditions. But, though I dont have the numbers, yet, and will do some checking, Im thinking there be more with the preventable kind of Diabetes or cld have, than not. And with that, and because, the medicine, though it may sound harsh, becomes more a matter of free enterprise, and maybe a tool to wake ppl up to eat right, drink water, and exercise.I'm aware of what ppl will think of a post like this. I dong care. It needs to be said. WE can say the same about some cancers and sexual contact diseases. Society and Ppl and Communities needs, again, good, yes, old fashioned (though it shld be) lessons in actions and consequences, instead of this crazy mess where ppl dont even seem to want to send murderers, rapists and robbers to jail, and blame cops for doing their job. This is all related to Immigration, as well. WE cant, continuously, be responsible for everyone else's, Person or Nation, irresponsibility, and allow laws of justice and of life be broken with no consequences, ever. Mercy is good. But is a joke when it is always applied to everyone. Then it's just support for lawlessness and immature society and ppl and does more harm than good.YK #TruthTeller Reply · Report Post",https://t.co/NW1jO0dUGr,others
Insulin Access and Affordability,"Insulin Access and Affordability The average list price of insulin has skyrocketed in recent years, nearly tripling between 2002 and 2013. As the list price increases, patients' costs also increase. Individuals with diabetes are often forced to choose between purchasing their medication or paying for other necessities, exposing them to serious short- and long-term health consequences. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) is committed to helping find solutions for individuals and families who lack affordable access to insulin. Make Insulin AffordableIn November of 2016 the ADA launched its Make Insulin Affordable campaign, which calls for all entities in the insulin supply chain to be transparent about the pricing process. Increasing transparency is the first step toward identifying viable, long-term solutions. More than 340,000 people have signed a petition calling for increased transparency in the insulin supply chain and for Congress to hold hearings to identify the reasons for the dramatic increases in insulin costs. Learn more about our Make Insulin Affordable campaign.Insulin Access and Affordability Working GroupIn the spring of 2017, the ADA Board of Directors convened an Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group (Working Group) to examine the full scope of the insulin affordability issue. Throughout 2017 and early 2018, the Working Group assembled existing public information about insulin prices and patient cost-sharing, and held discussions with multiple stakeholders at every level of the insulin supply chain to discuss how each entity affects the cost of insulin for the consumer. In May 2018, the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging held a hearing titled Insulin Access and Affordability: The Rising Cost of Treatment, during which the Working Group's Chair and ADA Chief Scientific, Medical and Mission Officer, Dr. William T. Cefalu, discussed the Working Group's findings. The Working Group's findings can be accessed in the June 2018 issue of Diabetes Care.Watch the Senate Special Committee on Aging hearingRead the Working Group's findings Public Policy Statement: Improving Insulin Access and AffordabilityOne of the core public policy priorities for the ADA is to ensure health insurance options provide adequate and affordable access to the care people with diabetes and prediabetes need. As part of that work, the ADA has actively worked to enact legislation and influence regulations improving or protecting access to and affordability of health care at the state and federal levels. Much of this work has addressed coverage for and affordability of prescription drugs for people with diabetes, including insulin.To follow-up on the Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group's conclusions and recommendations, ADA released a Public Policy Statement with recommended steps policy makers can take to improve access to affordable insulin. Read the Public Policy Statement.Insulin Affordability SurveyThe American Diabetes Association engaged Vault, LLC, a full-service accounting and research firm, to conduct independent research regarding insulin affordability for insulin users in the United States. Vault employed a programmatic sample exchange in order to ensure that the population invited to participate in the survey closely resembled the population of the United States.

Novel Hypoglycemia Metrics Detail 'Artificial Pancreas' Benefits,"LOS ANGELES -- Benefits to a ""closed-loop system"" for monitoring blood glucose and delivering exogenous insulin in type 1 diabetes went beyond mere reductions in HbA1c, according to a manufacturer-sponsored study presented here.Intensity of hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;70 mg/dL) was reduced 43% and its volume by 71% among adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, as assessed with a novel composite measure called the ""hypo-triad,"" according to Robert Vigersky, MD, of Medtronic Diabetes in Northridge, California, and colleagues.Among pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes -- including those 7 to 13 years -- reductions of 37% in hypoglycemia intensity and 61% in volume were seen.The ""hypo-triad"" included the area under the curve for blood glucose and frequency and duration of episodes with glucose &lt;70 mg/dL.The findings were presented at AACE 2019, the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.The research group also developed a ""Comprehensive Glucose Pentagon"" -- a separate composite that includes mean glucose level, intensity of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, time spent out of range, and coefficient of variation.Using this method of assessment, hypoglycemia was reduced by 8% in adults and adolescents and 12% in pediatric patients after initiating use of the closed loop system.""The hypo-triad and the [glucose pentagon] provide metrics beyond the A1c. This is of great value to the healthcare provider, investigators, as well as the patients as the patient wears the CGM technology day-to-day and [the provider] is able to evaluate how the patient is getting better,"" stated co-author John Shin, PhD, MBA, also of Medtronic Diabetes, during an oral presentation of the findings.This study was an analysis of previously reported pivotal trial data assessing Medtronic's MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system. This system -- otherwise known as the artificial pancreas -- was first FDA-approved in 2016 for adults and adolescents ages 14 years and older. Last year, this approval was expanded to include children as young as age 7.Data were gathered from continuous glucose monitors used during a 2-week run-in period and 3-month study phase of the adult and adolescent pivotal trial, as well as the pediatric pivotal trial. Reductions in intensity and volume of hypoglycemia were calculated by comparing the study phase numbers to those from the run-in period.These post-hoc findings add to the previous trial data that found a significant 7% relative decrease in HbA1c levels -- from 7.4% to 6.9% -- in the adult and adolescent population, as well as a 44% reduction in time spent in hypoglycemia. In the pediatric trial, children saw a 5% relative reduction in HbA1c -- from 7.9% to 7.5% -- and a 36% drop in the time spent in hypoglycemia with use of this system.""Of course these new composite metrics will require validation,"" Shin added, highlighting this limitation of the retrospective analysis. However, he noted with additional data, the novel metrics could help predict long-term patient outcomes besides just relying on HbA1c levels or time-in-range data.During an open discussion period, session moderator David Lieb, MD, of Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, suggested that the Comprehensive Glucose Pentagon model could be useful for monitoring patients' quality of life as well. Shin responded that quality of life could be a variable they look at more closely in future studies.Vigersky and co-authors are all employees of Medtronic, the maker of MiniMed's 670G Hybrid Closed-Loop System. 2019-04-26T11:30:00-0400",https://t.co/QLpuM0yAvl,others
"Insulin: Overview, History, Types, Side Effect, Usage","Last Updated on May 21, 2019Insulin, a chemical hormone produced inside the pancreas by the beta cell present in the islet cells. It's the most essential chemical produced by the body. Today we will discuss natural insulin produced by the body and the man-made insulin.OverviewInsulin is the life-saving chemical released by the beta cell present in the pancreas, an organ just behind our stomach. Without it, blood glucose in the blood is not able to enter inside the cells. ImportanceWhatever we eat, it divided into mostly 3 compounds i.e glucose, fat, and protein. Fat and protein utilized by the liver to process important job inside the body like reproductions of new cell, manufacturing of important hormones, etc..But glucose directly enters into the blood to serve the body cell as energy to our body. Simultaneously, insulin released to complete the process. It works as a key of the cell to enter glucose into it.Without insulin, glucose starts to accumulate in the blood and develop diseases like diabetes. High glucose in the blood not only develop diabetes but it also leads to a serious effect on heart, eye, leg, kidney, etc. So, the importance of insulin matters highly in a person body. In the previous time, diabetes person dies within 1 year of diagnosis.VIDEOWhat Happen If Body Is Not Able To Produce Insulin?If a person is not able to produce enough or no insulin called Type 1 diabetes patient. And the person has enough insulin but develop resistance to it called Type 2 diabetes patient. In both, the condition person has to take man-made insulin, if the oral medication doesn't work. Type 1 patient has mandatory to take insulin because their beta cell is completely destroyed by their own immune system. But type 2 patient can control their glucose level initially with medication like metformin, Janumet, etc. If not controlled with medication, they can take artificial insulin.History Of Man-Made Insulin?During 1922, insulin first experimented on a 22-year-old body and he lives a very well life for some more years.In 1923, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel prize for making insulin extracted from pig and cow. However, animal insulin is not the exact match of human hormones. But for a long time, it used to treat diabetes with a little side effect like reaction with the human immune system. And it approved by the FDA in 1939.But due to the limitation and side effect of animals hormone, scientist developed a new revolutionary way to manufacture insulin on large scale. In 1978, for large scale of production, the researcher makes insulin synthetically using bacteria. And it was the first protein-based chemical insulin made for human using biotechnology. It approved by the FDA in 1982.Types Of InsulinMajorly 4 types of insulin available in the market given to the diabetes patient according to the condition. The doctors may suggest 1 or more than 1 insulin type at a time to control their blood glucose.Rapid-Acting. It works within 15 minutes of injecting in the body. It used to treat the person with hyperglycemia. Rapid-acting insulin peak for 30-90 minutes and may work for 4-5 hours. Example of rapid-acting injection- Humalog, Novolog, ApidraShort-Acting. It works within 30 minutes of injecting. This used in treating the person whose sugar level spikes after eating. It peaks for 1-3 hours may last up to 4-6 hours. Example- RegularIntermediate Acting. It works after 2 hours of injecting and may last up to 15-20 hours. It used to treat the person suffering from the dawn phenomenon. The dawn phenomenon is a medical syndrome whose fasting glucose is higher than PP. This type of insulin works overnight to control fasting glucose. Example- NPH(N)Long Acting. It enters in the bloodstream slowly and may work for 24 hours. It doesn't peak, rather it works slowly during 24 hours to control blood glucose. Example- Lantus, Levemir, etc.Side EffectsHowever, insulin is a life saving drugs but it comes with some minor side effect.Weight gainNauseaHypoglycemia(low blood sugar)Lose of appetiteInterfere with the immune systemHow To Inject A Insulin Injection?Insulin is injected in any fatty tissue or muscle present in the body. For example you can inject it in your stomach, thigh, hand, back or wherever fat muscle is present. Basically there are 3 ways to inject insulin in the body. Syringe. A small syringe especially manufactures for insulin patient. However, it comes in different sizes, but 40 unit syringe is widely used.Pen Injector. 70% of the diabetic patient uses pen injector to inject insulin in their body. It is preloaded with insulin and can be disposed of after it's used.Insulin Pump. A device fitted on the belt of the patient and preset with defined units per meal. It is fitted on the patient belt and a small tube or needle is inserted in the skins so that it can regularly release insulin.Continuous Glucose Monitoring(CGM) &amp; Automatic Insulin Pump. This used mostly in children with type 1 diabetes. CGM automatically senses the glucose level in the blood and inject the insulin through an insulin pump according to the requirement of the body. In addition, it is most beneficial for the children for working parents. It can be fixed on the belt of the patient and a small flexible needle inserted in the body.Insulin PumpCarry AwayType 1 diabetes patient has mandatory to take insulin. But type 2 patient who failed to control their blood sugar with medication can take insulin for 3 months. During this 3 month don't take any oral medication. Your pancreas will get rest and the body will try to repair pancreas if not badly damaged.After 3 months your medication will work again and then you can leave your insulin.Read also10 WAYS TO TREAT DIABETES TYPE 2 &amp; PREDIABETES DIABETES TREATMENT | SECRETS OF HEALING NATURALLYIf you able to gain any information from this article, please give a like and share to this page.

Insurance Company Caps Insulin Copays at $25,"In case you missed the recent headlines: One of the largest insurance companies in the country has made a move to cap copays for insulin at $25 for a month's supply, attempting to broaden access to this life-sustaining medication that's become the poster child for outrageously high drug pricing in America.Share on PinterestAnnounced on April 2, the combined company of Cigna and Express Scripts -- which finalized a $67 billion merger at the end of 2018 -- plans to offer its members in participating plans a Patient Assurance Program that will cap out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, copays, co-insurance) for insulin at $25/month max. The new program will be finalized by year's end for Express Scripts members, and the start of 2020 for Cigna members.This comes at a time of increasing pressure over skyrocketing insulin prices in America, with multiple Congressional hearings underway -- including one today before the Senate Finance Committee with insurers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), and one tomorrow (4/10/19) involving the big three insulin makers being called to testify in front of a House panel. The current Insulin Pricing Crisis is a system-wide issue that has bubbled to the top of public consciousness, and is thankfully now being heatedly discussed at both the federal and state levels. While Cigna and Express Scripts' new $25 copay program is ""only a band-aid"" for certain people who have particular insurance plans that opt in, it is being called ""a step in the right direction"" by vocal advocates who recognize that it will help many people couldn't otherwise afford the insulin they need to survive.We reached out to Cigna/Express Scripts to answer the many questions that come to mind for PWDs (people with diabetes) like us: First off, how many PWDs actually stand to benefit from this?More than 700,000 people enrolled in commercially insured plans across Cigna and Express Scripts had filed a claim for insulin in 2018. So that is the potential population for this program, Cigna says. Many news stories report that the average Cigna/ES member is only paying $41 a month for insulin prior to this program, which is already fairly affordable...?The devil's in the details, of course. Cigna states that for the average Cigna/Express Scripts member, the price of a 30-day supply of insulin is only $41.50, while for those on High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) it's $81/month, and up to $100/month for those on HDHPs in which insulin is not on the preventative drug list where deductibles don't apply.Those amounts may not sound exorbitant, but what they don't take into account is that early in the year, prior to meeting an annual deductible or coinsurance requirement, many people are exposed to high costs and thus unaffordable insulin. So while a copay may hit just $41.50/month at some point late in the year, the truth is that for many months before that happens, the cost is hundreds of dollars higher. So yes, Cigna has some feel-good numbers to share, but they are a bit misleading and don't reflect reality.Cigna says this new Patient Assurance Program will amount to members' annual costs dropping from $1,000 to $250 -- which is meaningful however you slice it. Wait, members will only have to pay $25 -- and not meet their deductible first?Yes, that's correct. For those higher deductible plans, this moves insulin to a ""preventative drug"" category in which the deductible wouldn't apply. Instead, the low copay is available immediately. What insulins are being offered through this program?All three big insulin manufacturers -- Lilly, Novo and Sanofi -- are participating, according to Cigna/ES. We're told they plan to include both short-acting and basal insulins, but a full product list isn't yet available. We were immediately concerned about ""preferred brand"" status that could lead to another ""formulary war"" where drug makers jockey to get better access and lower copays ahead of their competitors, but Cigna insists the program will not have an impact on formulary status. How much insulin do members get for that $25 copay?The cost is $25 for a month's worth of each patient's individual prescription of insulin, whatever amount that may be and whether it's in vials or pen cartridges. Share on Pinterest But what if my Cigna insurance plan requires me to get 90 days of insulin rather than a single month's worth?You will still benefit, Cigna says. The copay for a 90-day supply, whether via mail delivery or retail, will be $75. When does this program begin and end?The powers-that-be tell us they expect it will launch for Express Scripts members before the end of this year, and for Cigna members beginning in 2020. This is not a pilot or trial program, and there's no end-date attached at this time. Why not just lower list prices for all insulins offered through Cigna?That's a separate issue, we're told (and given the convoluted nature of drug pricing including industry rebates and kickbacks, we're not surprised). So how is this being paid for?We wondered whether Cigna Corp. was absorbing the overhead costs. As it turns out, the participating drug makers (Lilly, Novo and Sanofi) are all providing an additional discount applied at the point of sale to push the copay down to $25. Sadly, this doesn't eliminate the issue of established rebates in broader insulin pricing, we're told. How do I know if my employer has signed up to participate in this?""We are not able to just automatically apply it to our clients,"" a Cigna spokeswoman said. ""They have to agree to participate because it's their benefit. We are going to encourage all clients to implement this as a program, and feel confident most will be eager to implement it."" There is no charge to participate, and Cigna assures us that ""most plans"" will not see any additional cost to get the co-payment down to $25 for the patient. Employers interested in participating can learn more about during open enrollment periods (annual insurance discussions when plan designs are evaluated), and are welcome to contact Cigna/ES to find out more. What about Medicare and Medicaid? And those without insurance, or who aren't covered by Cigna plans?To clarify: Sorry Folks, this will not apply to those on federal plans. It's a program specifically offered by Cigna and Express Scripts for their members. Will other insurance companies follow suit?We certainly hope so. When asked for a comment on that, a Cigna spokesperson provided this statement: ""Our job is to provide better care, more choice, and greater affordability. Our Patient Assurance Program offers all three. For customers and members who rely on insulin, Cigna and Express Scripts have found a way to deliver greater affordability and peace of mind to these patients, and we are confident that our new program will remove cost as a barrier for people in participating plans who need insulin. We're also glad the manufacturers are able to work with us to make it happen."" Why is this happening now?Good question. We wondered if it was a direct result of the new federal Health and Human Services (HHS) proposal to eliminate drug rebates... but Cigna says they have been working on this concept ""for a while"" and were finally able to make it materialize following the Cigna/ES merger finalization in December 2018. We still think it's pretty coincidental (and likely planned) that this move comes just as insurers and PBMs are being summoned before Congressional panels over drug and insulin pricing. Right. Isn't this just another PR move to take the heat off payors and other decision-makers on drug pricing?Some may roll their eyes, saying it's only a PR move -- but while there may be truth to that, it still helps.Just like the recently announced half-price Insulin Lispro from Eli Lilly, this is nowhere near a final solution to America's Insulin Pricing Crisis, of course. No one claims it is. But just like with that offer, if one more family can afford the insulin they desperately need, then it's a win for our Diabetes Community.The advocacy doesn't stop here, of course. We continue to cheer on the many insulin pricing advocacy initiatives and efforts to call manufacturers and PBM middle-men to task. Here's to slowly but surely moving the needle on insulin access (no pun intended).",https://t.co/dz6xugsdV6,others
Insulin too pricey? Some options to cut costs for diabetics,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The skyrocketing price of insulin has some diabetics scrambling to cover the cost of the life-saving medication.Others are skipping doses or using smaller amounts than needed, and sometimes landing in the emergency room, patients and advocates told Congress recently.About 7.4 million Americans use insulin to keep their blood sugar at safe levels. Insulin needs vary by patient, as do costs depending on insurance coverage.Amid the public uproar about costs, drugmakers and some prescription plans are starting to offer patients bigger discounts. Express Scripts and its parent company, insurer Cigna, just began offering a month's worth of insulin to eligible patients for $25 per month. Express Scripts is now lining up other insurers whose prescription plans it manages.For most insulin and other diabetes medicines, manufacturers offer coupons reducing monthly out-of-pocket costs.The American Diabetes Association connects patients to assistance programs through www.insulinhelp.org , though not everyone qualifies.""We do not want anyone to skip or ration doses,"" says Dr. William Cefalu, the advocacy group's chief scientific officer.If you are struggling to afford insulin, tell your doctors, says Cefalu. They might be able to recommend a free clinic or patient assistance plan, or suggest cheaper options.If cost is an issue, here are other ways to save money:TRY OLDER KINDS OF INSULINTalk to your doctor about switching to older, cheaper kinds of insulin, suggests Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Dangerous blood sugar plunges are more common with those, as they don't control blood sugar as tightly as newer, more expensive insulins. Patients using older products such as Novolin and Humulin R must test their blood sugar more often, and more carefully time when they inject insulin before meals, Gabbay stresses.SWITCH TO VIALSPatients who've been using insulin pens — injection devices containing multiple insulin doses — could switch to insulin vials. They are cheaper but less convenient. It requires drawing insulin out of the vial into a syringe, which makes doses less precise, and the abdominal injections hurt a bit more. Another option is Basaglar, a cheaper near-copy of the popular long-acting Lantus insulin pens.CHECK INSURANCEReview your insurance company's list of covered medications for insulin with the lowest copayments; coverage and copayments often change in January and there may be cheaper choices. Other savings options include getting a 90-day supply instead of 30-day refills.SHOP AROUNDCheck prices at different pharmacies. Prices can vary widely for insulin, other diabetes drugs and the testing strips and lancets needed to check blood sugar levels. Patients can look up drug prices at multiple drugstores and get coupons for big discounts at the pharmacy counter at www.GoodRx.com . Or try www.healthwarehouse.com , which sells medicines at cash prices, which can be cheaper even if you have insurance.Medicare and Medicaid patients can't combine coupons with their insurance, but a coupon alone might be the cheapest option.The three main insulin makers offer savings, including:—Sanofi's Insulins ValYOU Savings Program offers uninsured and cash-paying patients one insulin vial for $99 or one insulin pen for $149 each month. Starting in June, it will offer up to 10 vials and/or pens of most of its insulins for $99. Its Sanofi Patient Connection offers low-income uninsured patients free insulin.—Eli Lilly will soon sell Insulin Lispro, a half-price version of its top-selling insulin Humalog KwikPens, for $265 per month. Its Lilly Diabetes Solution Center helps patients find affordable options.—Novo Nordisk has long sold an older insulin, ReliOn, through Walmart for about $25 a vial. It's now available through CVS Health and Express Scripts. Novo Nordisk offers copay savings cards for Tresiba and other insulins, plus patient assistance with generous income limits at www.NovoCare.com .___Follow Linda A.

Print. @article{8540095, abstract = {Background: This study investigates prospective associations of anthropometrical and lifestyle indices with insulin resistance (IR) in European children from the IDEFICS cohort. Insulin resistance (IR) is a growing concern in childhood obesity and a central aspect of the metabolic syndrome (MS). It most likely represents the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Methods: This longitudinal study included 3348 preadolescent children aged 3 to 10.9 years from 8 European countries who were observed from 2007/2008 to 2009/2010. The main outcome measure in the present analysis is HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment as a common proxy indicator to quantify IR) at follow-up and in its longitudinal development. Anthropometrical measures and lifestyle indices, including objectively determined physical activity, were considered, among others factors, as determinants of IR. Prospective associations between IR at follow-up and anthropometrical and lifestyle indices were estimated by logistic regression models. Results: Country-specific prevalence rates of IR in the IDEFICS cohort of European children showed a positive trend with weight category. Prospective multivariate analyses showed the strongest positive associations of IR with BMI z-score (OR = 2.6 for unit change from the mean, 95 \% CI 2.1-3.1) and z-score of waist circumference (OR = 2.2 for unit change from the mean, 95 \% CI 1.9-2.6), which were analysed in separate models, but also for sex (OR = 2.2 for girls vs. boys, 95 \% CI 1.5-3.1 up to OR 2.5, 95 \% CI 1.8-3.6 depending on the model), audio-visual media time (OR = 1.2 for an additional hour per day, 95 \% CI 1.0-1.4 in both models) and an inverse association of objectively determined physical activity (OR = 0.5 for 3rd compared to 1st quartile, 95 \% CI 0.3-0.9 in both models). A longitudinal reduction of HOMA-IR was accompanied with a parallel decline in BMI. Conclusions: This study is, to our knowledge, the first prospective study on IR in a preadolescent children's population. It supports the common hypothesis that overweight and obesity are the main determinants of IR. Our data also indicate that physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle are likewise associated with the development of IR, independent of weight status. The promotion of physical activity should thus be considered as an equal option to dietary intervention for the treatment of IR in the paediatric practice.}, articleno = {97}, author = {Peplies, Jenny and B{\""o}rnhorst, Claudia and G{\""u}nther, Kathrin and Fraterman, Arno and Russo, Paola and Veidebaum, Toomas and Tornaritis, Michael and De Henauw, Stefaan and Marild, Staffan and Molnar, D{\'e}nes and Moreno, Luis A and Ahrens, Wolfgang}, issn = {1479-5868}, journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY}, language = {eng}, pages = {12}, title = {Longitudinal associations of lifestyle factors and weight status with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in preadolescent children : the large prospective cohort study IDEFICS}, url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-016-0424-4}, volume = {13}, year = {2016},}",https://t.co/mP2DDczEmE,others
Anti-inflammatory Agents in the Treatment of Diabetes and Its Vascular Complications,"The prevalence of diabetes is on the rise, with 415 million people affected worldwide according to recent data from the International Diabetes Federation (1). This number is predicted to increase further, with 642 million people expected to develop diabetes by 2040. While many factors are known to contribute to the development of diabetes and its complications, the involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases has been gaining interest. It has long been appreciated that inflammation is central to the pathology of the pancreatic islet in type 1 diabetes. However, growing evidence suggests that inflammation also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, including obesity-related insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and diabetes-related vascular complications. Pioneering studies suggest that immunomodulatory treatments may improve glycemia, β-cell function, and/or insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes (2,3). These studies constitute a proof of concept that chronic inflammation is implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, and therefore targeting inflammation may ameliorate diabetes, preventing its progression and vascular complications. However, the effects of immunomodulatory treatments are not limited to tissues involved in disease pathophysiology and thus might have unwarranted side effects. Moreover, current antidiabetes drugs may alleviate systemic and tissue-specific inflammation (4–12), and therefore the added value of using specific immunomodulatory treatments needs to be confirmed. Herein, we review the anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects of standard antidiabetes medications and of novel anti-inflammatory treatments. We further discuss issues that should be addressed prior to implementation of immune-based therapy in the treatment of diabetes.Role of Inflammation in Metabolic DisordersMultiple mechanisms are thought to contribute to β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, and vascular complications of diabetes. They have previously been extensively reviewed and are beyond the scope of the current review (13). We briefly refer to several key mechanisms regulating inflammation in diabetes and their translational implications. In diabetes, hyperglycemia and elevated free fatty acids may promote inflammation by stimulating glucose utilization along with alterations in oxidative phosphorylation (3,4,14). Such metabolic dysregulation has been shown to induce a proinflammatory trait in macrophages residing or invading the adipose tissue and other tissues including the islets and vasculature (15–19). Glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity might also exert oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which in turn elicits an inflammatory response by activating thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and the NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which increase the release of active interleukin (IL)-1β (3,4,14,18,20). IL-1β further amplifies inflammation by inducing the expression of various cytokines and chemokines, resulting in the recruitment of immune cells including macrophages (""auto-stimulation"") (21). Similar mechanisms have been reported in diabetic β-cells, adipose tissue, and blood vessels (18,20,22,23). In type 2 diabetes, oligomers of islet amyloid polypeptide deposit in the pancreas and may trigger inflammation by stimulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and the generation of mature IL-1β (24). Stress and inflammation may eventually lead to apoptosis and contribute to β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis.In addition, obesity is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome along with increased gut leakiness of bacterial wall lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) that may further promote tissue inflammation (25,26). Endotoxins, free fatty acids (probably in conjunction with fetuin), and cholesterol induce inflammation by activating Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways and, subsequently, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated release of a broad range of cytokines and chemokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β, IL-8, and MCP-1 that promote the accumulation of various immune cells in different tissues (17,18). It has recently been reported that in obesity, alterations of the gut microbiome might stimulate not only the innate immune system but also the adaptive immune system, which might contribute to insulin resistance (27). Adipose tissue inflammation can also be triggered by local hypoxia caused by rapid expansion of adipose tissue with insufficient vascular adaptation (28).The renin-angiotensin system may also play a role in inflammation, insulin resistance, and vascular damage (29–32). Recent data suggest that this system may have a role in islet inflammation and β-cell dysfunction, independent of its effects on glucose metabolism. Angiotensin II has been shown to induce expression of chemokine MCP-1 and IL-6, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and insulin secretion, as well as increased β-cell apoptosis (33).These findings shed new light on the mechanisms of inflammation in obesity and diabetes and open new venues for prevention of inflammation by modifying the proinflammatory microbiota or by using inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Alternatively, it is possible to use treatments that target key molecules that regulate the inflammatory response.Anti-inflammatory Properties of Antidiabetes DrugsThe link between nutrient metabolism and inflammation raises the hypothesis that correction of metabolic abnormalities by lifestyle modifications and/or antidiabetes medications may reduce inflammation, thereby improving β-cell function and insulin resistance while protecting against vascular complications, hence modifying the natural history of type 2 diabetes. The current available treatments for type 2 diabetes act through diverse mechanisms to improve glycemia. Many of these treatments also exert anti-inflammatory effects that might be mediated via their metabolic effects on hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia or by directly modulating the immune system. Part of the findings as to the effects of different medications on systemic and tissue-specific inflammation was obtained in vitro or in animal models. Notably, in preclinical studies testing the anti-inflammatory effects of antidiabetes drugs, the drug concentrations used were much higher than those used in clinical practice; therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Below, we summarize the current data on the anti-inflammatory properties of antidiabetes medications (Table 1).Table 1 Anti-inflammatory effects of glucose-lowering agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetesMetforminCurrently the first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes, metformin improves diabetes control primarily by suppressing hepatic glucose production and by improving insulin sensitivity. Its effects are thought to be mediated in part though activation of AMPK, a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis known to exert both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects (34). Metformin has also been shown to directly inhibit production of reactive oxygen species from complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages, metformin inhibited production of the proform of IL-1β, while it boosted induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (35). Metformin has been shown to inhibit proinflammatory responses in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (5,36). Recent reports have demonstrated that metformin may attenuate oxidized LDL-induced proinflammatory responses in monocytes and macrophages and inhibit monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation (37). In rodents, it decreased the expression of the proinflammatory and proapoptotic protein TXNIP in β-cells and hepatocytes (38). In human studies, however, the effects of metformin on inflammation are not well established. In the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program, metformin modestly reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (39). Others found that metformin decreased the levels of several markers of endothelial dysfunction and coagulation but did not affect TNF-α or CRP (40). In the LANCET Trial: A Trial of Long-acting Insulin Injection to Reduce C-reactive Protein in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes, metformin did not modify the levels of inflammatory biomarkers in patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes, despite improved glycemia (41). Of note, recent studies suggest that metformin may have beneficial effects in chronic inflammatory diseases and cancers and may extend life span independent of its effects on glucose metabolism (42,43). Several clinical studies are currently assessing the effects of metformin in this context and whether these are mediated via modulation of the inflammatory state.SulfonylureasWhile these agents directly stimulate insulin secretion by the β-cell, they have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. As an example, glyburide has been shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β activation in macrophages (24,44). Similarly, gliclazide also decreased the expression of inflammatory markers and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes (45). By contrast, in various comparative clinical trials, no significant changes in CRP were observed with sulfonylurea (SU) therapy, whereas significant reductions were found with the thiazolidinedione (TZD) pioglitazone and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) exanatide (46–48). In a recent 52-week comparative study examining the effects of metformin, gliclazide, and pioglitazone on markers of inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial function, no improvements were seen in inflammatory markers (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α) with SU therapy compared with the other treatments, while similar glycemic control was attained (49).TZDsExtensive data support the direct role of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)γ in the negative regulation of inflammation. TZDs are PPARγ agonists that improve metabolism by increasing insulin sensitivity primarily by increasing glucose utilization and decreasing hepatic glucose production. In rodents, they may have direct protective effects on the β-cell against oxidative stress and apoptosis, which may contribute to preservation of β-cell mass (50). Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism(s) underlying the beneficial metabolic effects of TZDs are still not well understood and may involve stimulation of AMPK; both PPARγ and AMPK are important regulators of inflammation (51). Indeed, TZDs have anti-inflammatory effects, which may affect both insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. TZDs have been shown to decrease inflammatory markers in visceral adipose tissue, liver, atherosclerotic plaques, and circulating plasma (52). Pioglitazone treatment decreased invasion of adipose tissue by proinflammatory macrophages and increased hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity (53). Treatment with TZDs also decreased inflammation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in atherosclerotic lesions (54,55).Various clinical studies have examined the anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic properties of TZDs. A meta-analysis showed that pioglitazone and rosiglitazone significantly decreased serum CRP levels in both people with and people without diabetes, irrespective of effects on glycemia (56). Treatment with TZDs improved endothelial function, decreased hs-CRP and inflammatory markers, and increased adiponectin levels (46,48,49,57–59). In a study using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone treatment attenuated inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques (60). This was associated with increased HDL cholesterol level and decreased hs-CRP. This may explain the finding that treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes with pioglitazone was associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity (61).Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 InhibitorsThere is substantial evidence that dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors can improve a variety of cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation (62–64). DPP-4 inhibitors were found to suppress NLRP3, TLR4, and IL-1β expression in human macrophages (65). High-fat diet–fed obese rodents of advanced age treated with vildagliptin for 11 months had improved glucose tolerance, enhanced insulin secretion, and higher survival rate (9). Furthermore, treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor prevented peri-insulitis, typically observed in rodents fed a high-fat diet. In clinical studies, a potent anti-inflammatory effect has been reported with sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with sitagliptin for 12 weeks reduced mRNA expression of CD26, TNF-α, TLR2, TLR4, proinflammatory kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 and inhibitory κB kinase, and inhibitor of chemokine receptor CCR-2 in mononuclear cells, as well as of plasma CRP, IL-6, and free fatty acids (10). In a cohort of Japanese patients with uncontrolled diabetes and coronary artery disease, sitagliptin improved the inflammatory state and endothelial function (66). Furthermore, sitagliptin added to the antidiabetes regimen of patients with type 2 diabetes already treated with metformin, and pioglitazone reduced hs-CRP and other inflammatory markers (67,68). Studies examining the effects of the DPP-4 inhibitors vildagliptin and linagliptin showed that they also reduce inflammation (69,70). However, large randomized controlled prospective studies analyzing the cardiovascular safety of different DPP-4 inhibitors, including Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (SAVOR-TIMI 53), Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE), and Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS), have not demonstrated cardiovascular benefit with DPP-4 inhibitors (71–73). Of note, in these studies follow-up was relatively short, the patients already had established cardiovascular disease, and the studies were designed to show noninferiority rather than superiority. The findings should therefore be interpreted with caution.GLP-1 RAsGLP-1 RAs induce weight loss and improve glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors, which may be partially mediated by their anti-inflammatory effects. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with GLP-1 analogs may modulate the proinflammatory activity of the innate immune system, leading to reduced proinflammatory activation of macrophages and consequently the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and increased adiponectin (74). With regard to the effects of GLP-1 analogs on CRP, a small placebo-controlled study demonstrated a significant reduction in CRP levels with exenatide (75). In a 12-month comparative study, exenatide demonstrated a significant decrease in hs-CRP compared with SU (47). However, the effects of GLP-1 RAs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are currently unknown.InsulinSeveral studies have suggested that insulin may exert an anti-inflammatory response, independent of its effects on glycemia (76,77). Insulin has been shown to alleviate inflammation through several mechanisms, including increased endothelial nitric oxide release and decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and immune mediators, such as NF-κB, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and MCP-1, as well as several TLRs (76). In a randomized parallel-group study in patients with type 2 diabetes, serum concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 were markedly reduced in insulin-treated patients compared with metformin, despite similar glycemic control (78). This may suggest that insulin reduces inflammation, irrespective of its effects on glycemia. In contrast, in LANCET, treatment with insulin compared with placebo or metformin did not provide an anti-inflammatory benefit, despite improved glycemia (41). Similarly, in Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN), insulin treatment did not affect cardiovascular mortality (79). Overall, the findings as to the anti-inflammatory effects of insulin are controversial and inconclusive.Sodium–Glucose Cotransporter 2 InhibitorsSodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors improve glycemia by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidney, inducing glucosuria and lowering plasma glucose levels. Currently, there are limited data available with regard to the anti-inflammatory properties of SGLT2 inhibitors. Treatment with the SGLT inhibitor phlorizin in Psammomys obesus gerbils was shown to decrease islet inflammation, possibly related to the improvement in glucotoxicity (3). In type 2 diabetic mice, the SGLT2 inhibitor ipraglifloxin was shown to improve hyperglycemia, insulin secretion, hyperlipidemia, and liver levels of oxidative stress biomarkers and reduce markers of inflammation including IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, and CRP levels (80). While no clinical trial has reported the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on inflammatory markers, the recent EMPA-REG OUTCOME [BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients] demonstrated a 38% reduction in cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease after treatment with empagliflozin (81). It is of interest whether this effect is in part mediated by anti-inflammatory properties.Metabolic Effects of Anti-inflammatory DrugsTargeted anti-inflammatory therapy has been suggested for both prevention and treatment of diabetes; this has previously been extensively reviewed (82). Herein, we briefly summarize the current data on the metabolic effects of different anti-inflammatory treatments (Table 2).Table 2 Metabolic effects of anti-inflammatory drugsAnti–TNF-αTNF-α was the first proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes; this has been confirmed in preclinical studies in various animal models (2). However, to date, TNF-α antagonism has not demonstrated any clear benefit in type 2 diabetes in man (83–87). Careful analysis of these clinical studies suggests that all have serious limitations, as they were underpowered and of short duration (13). A number of observational studies have demonstrated that treatment of subjects without diabetes and with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn disease, with TNF-α antagonists has improved glycemia and reduced the risk for developing diabetes. While the majority of these studies are not prospective, and the improvement is not a direct effect on glucose metabolism necessarily but, rather, improvement in the underlying disease, these observations warrant a well-designed clinical study of TNF antagonism in patients with type 2 diabetes.Anti–IL-1βSince the discovery of the central role of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, numerous studies have investigated the role of IL-1β blockade on insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. To date, eight independent clinical studies conducted with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) or IL-1β–specific antibody (gevokizumab, canakizumab, and LY21891020) have demonstrated beneficial effects on metabolic parameters including decreased HbA1c and enhanced insulin sensitivity and β-cell secretory function, with concomitant improvement in inflammatory markers (82,88–91). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study involving 70 patients with type 2 diabetes, IL-1 blockade with anakinra reduced HbA1c, CRP, IL-6 levels, and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, while enhancing C-peptide secretion, indicating improved β-cell function; these beneficial effects persisted up to several weeks after treatment cessation (92). Although the duration of these studies does not provide definitive proof, the findings suggest a role for IL-1β blockade in modulating diabetes-associated inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. With regard to safety, IL-1β antagonism was generally well tolerated, with the main concern being that anakinra requires daily injections and often causes adverse reactions at the injection site. The humanized antibodies against IL-1β allow for monthly injections, which minimize these localized reactions.SalsalateSalsalate, a prodrug of salicylate, with fewer adverse reactions than aspirin and sodium salicylate, has demonstrated beneficial effects on glycemia and insulin sensitivity, probably through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway (93). To date, there are seven independent clinical trials that consistently demonstrate improvement in glycemia with salsalate (94–100). These data support the role of inflammation and of the NF-κB pathway in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes that might become novel therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes. Salsalate also reduces insulin clearance and may therefore partly improve glycemia via noninflammatory mechanisms. The safety of salsalate was studied in a well-designed multicenter, placebo-controlled study of 48 weeks' duration (96). While the drug was well tolerated, a small increase in LDL cholesterol level was observed. Further, urinary albumin secretion was also increased and returned to baseline upon discontinuation of treatment. While salsalate may be an effective and inexpensive adjunct to type 2 diabetes treatment, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term cardiovascular and renal safety and to determine whether these effects are sustainable with continued administration.DiacereinA drug currently used in the treatment of arthritis, diacerein decreases levels of IL-1β, although its mechanism of action is unknown. In drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes, diacerein treatment improved insulin secretion and HbA1c levels, while reducing IL-1β and TNF-α levels (101). Further studies are warranted to clarify its long-term efficacy and safety.Chloroquine/HydroxychloroquineAntimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are commonly used to treat autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The precise anti-inflammatory mechanism of HCQ is not known and is probably related to alkalinization of endosomal organelles in immune cells. HCQ has been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus and to improve glycemia in patients with rheumatic disorders and diabetes (102,103). Animal studies have shown that antimalarials improve insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity in diabetic rats (104). HCQ also has been shown to inhibit insulin degradation in rat hepatocytes (105). A few small randomized controlled trials showed that HCQ lowers HbA1c and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (106–110). The mechanisms of hypoglycemia with HCQ are inferred from studies of the parent drug, chloroquine, which has been shown to increase insulin levels in man by both increasing insulin secretion and inhibiting its degradation (111). Well-designed clinical studies are needed to further evaluate the effect of HCQ in individuals with type 2 diabetes and whether its beneficial metabolic effects are related to its anti-inflammatory properties.DiscussionThe association between hyperglycemia, inflammation, and vascular complications in diabetes is now well established. Different antidiabetes drugs, such as TZDs, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, and insulin, have bona fide anti-inflammatory effects. Since metabolic dysregulation itself induces inflammation, effective antidiabetes treatments may alleviate inflammation by virtue of improving the metabolic state. It is therefore difficult to clearly differentiate the effects of the drugs on metabolism from their direct effects on the immune system. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of different medications are partial and inconsistent, probably due to incomplete normalization of metabolic dysregulation or because diabetes-associated inflammation is multifactorial; the mechanisms involved include, but are not limited to, hyperglycemia. This rationalizes testing the impact of anti-inflammatory treatments on glycemia, diabetes progression, and cardiovascular morbidity. Exciting new data show that different treatments designed to modulate the immune response have beneficial metabolic effects; this opens new venues for the treatment of diabetes. However, it should be emphasized that the impact of such treatments on glycemia over long periods of time and more importantly on cardiovascular complications is still unknown. Moreover, a number of the anti-inflammatory drugs may have metabolic effects that are unrelated to their anti-inflammatory effects. This complicates the interpretation of the findings as to the metabolic effects of anti-inflammatory medications. It also remains a challenge to adequately assess inflammation in man, since crude surrogate markers are being used, and it is currently difficult to appreciate tissue-specific variations in the level and type of inflammation. Preclinical studies in animal models are most helpful in this regard; however, it may be difficult to extrapolate from findings in animal models to the clinical setting. Finally, there are important questions as to the safety and cost of these treatments.Inflammation may have an important role in the development and progression of diabetes and its complications; however, the impact of experimental anti-inflammatory treatments on diabetes deterioration over time and cardiovascular outcomes is still elusive. To date, there is limited evidence showing that current antidiabetes medications have sustainable effects on glycemia and are able to prevent cardiovascular events. EMPA-REG showed that treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin dramatically decreased cardiovascular mortality (81). It is of great interest to see whether empagliflozin has anti-inflammatory effects and if this plays a role in mediating its effects on mortality. It remains to be shown whether anti-inflammatory treatments administered alone or together with current antidiabetes drugs can prevent the vascular complications of diabetes. Further studies are required to clarify the role of anti-inflammatory therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes. Better understanding of the inflammatory basis for diabetes may provide for improved modalities for diabetes prevention and treatment, using novel targeted approaches in conjunction with current pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions.",https://t.co/vGoiV4sdkr,others

Dr. Berg talks about the basics of healthy Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting. What is Keto or Ketosis? • Keto means fat burning• When you burn fat, the fat breaks down into what's called Ketones where the body can use it as an alternative fuel, a much better fuel-source than sugar fuel. • Healthy Ketosis is a version of regular ketosis based on a principle where you have to ""Get healthy first, then lose the weight."" And ""get healthy"" means related to eating healthy high quality foods that is providing all of your nutrients. What is Intermittent Fasting? • It is a pattern of eating and not eating. Instead of doing 3-6 meals a day and snacking, you are eating less frequently because every time you eat you raise the hormone called Insulin. How to Lower Insulin? • Less to Zero Carbohydrates – Sugar, refined carbs, grains, pasta, cereal, biscuits, juice, alcohol, etc. • Less frequent mealsHigh Insulin Symptoms• Belly Fat • High Blood Pressure • High Cholesterol • Fatigue (especially after eating)• Decrease Cognitive Function, Lack of Focus, Poor Memory • Moody, irritable, depressed, grouchy • Cravings• Hungry all the time (especially in between meals)Benefits of Keto and Intermittent Fasting• Weight loss • Reducing Inflammation • Cognitive Function • Overall mood • Making the body work better Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 52 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.

History of insulin,"History of insulin Rosie Cotter explores the history of this important protein and its role in diabetes In 1922, a 14-year-old boy named Leonard Thompson lay in Toronto General Hospital dying from diabetes. He weighed less than 30 kg and was at risk of slipping into a diabetic coma. To avoid this, Leonard's father allowed him to be injected with a new pancreatic extract, now known as insulin.At the time, people with diabetes tried to control their condition through a strict diet, but they usually died within a year of diagnosis. Remarkably, after the injection, Leonard regained his strength and appetite and went on to live for several more years.News of insulin and Leonard's recovery spread around the world and brought notoriety to Dr Frederick Banting and student George Best at the University of Toronto. With the support of Professor John Macleod and biochemist Bertram Collip, Banting and Best had successfully extracted insulin from an animal pancreas and purified it so that it could be administered to humans.Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels in the blood. When we eat, our glucose levels rise and insulin is released into the bloodstream. Insulin works by regulating glucose transport proteins in cells so they can take up the glucose and use it as an energy source or convert it to glycogen for storage.Type 1 diabetes develops when the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans found in the pancreas have been destroyed and the body is unable to produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can still make some insulin, but it is produced in insufficient amounts or in a form that does not work properly.Discovery and applicationBetween 1920 and 1921, Banting and Best had been removing dogs' pancreases to make them diabetic. Building on the work of other researchers, Banting and Best took fluid from healthy dogs' islets of Langerhans (cells within the pancreas that produce insulin) and injected them into the dogs with diabetes to reverse its effects.The dogs remained healthy for as long as they were injected with the extract. Subsequently, Collip purified the insulin so it could be used on humans.The researchers' work led to the widespread use of animal insulin to treat diabetes. Banting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923 for the discovery, sharing the prize money with Best and Collip. For the next 60 years, people with diabetes relied on animal insulin – usually from pigs or cows – to survive.Sequencing insulinIn 1955, insulin became the first protein to be sequenced. Biochemist Fred Sanger took on the challenge of determining the amino acid sequence of insulin, which had never been done before.He developed a method to 'read' the amino acid sequence that involving splitting insulin into fragments and carrying out techniques called electrophoresis and chromatography on these.He found that insulin is made up of two amino acid chains linked together by disulphide bonds, and it is because of this discovery that we know that every human protein has a unique sequence of any or all of the 20 types of amino acids. Sanger was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1959 for the discovery.Chemical synthesis and structureInsulin also became the first protein to be chemically synthesised, in 1963. Researchers were unable to produce it in large quantities, however, so people continued to rely on animal insulin to treat diabetes. Although animal insulin worked well, it wasn't an exact match to the human hormone and some patients suffered minor side-effects, including immune reactions to the hormone.Nobel Prize winner Dorothy Hodgkin deciphered the molecular structure of insulin in 1969 using X-ray crystallography. Knowing the structure meant that scientists could begin to understand more about the properties of insulin, such as how it is formed, which receptors it binds to and how it is made and transported around the body. Having this kind of information is invaluable for understanding more about conditions such as diabetes and how to treat them.Large-scale manufacturingThe type of insulin used today came about in 1978 when researchers were able to manufacture a form of human insulin using biotechnology. Scientists genetically modified bacteria to produce the separate A and B chains that make up human insulin and combined these through a chemical process.The result? The mass production of synthetic human insulin. This revolutionised the treatment of diabetes because it meant that insulin could be produced on a mass scale and used without the side-effects associated with animal insulin. Lead image:A man with diabetes using an injection pen to administer insulin.Wellcome Library, London References Questions for discussionHow does Banting and Best's method of testing their extract differ from how we test new treatments today?Banting and Best's research built on the discoveries of several scientists working before them.

Democratic lawmaker to drug industry on insulin prices: 'Your days are numbered',"In a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on insulin prices Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and fellow lawmakers blasted manufacturers and drug industry intermediaries for creating a situation in which as much as a quarter of the population with diabetes is rationing and skimping on lifesaving doses of the drug because of cost.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Schakowsky told the panel. ""I just want you to know your days are numbered."" Lawmakers heard from patients with diabetes as well, including 28-year-old Kristen Whitney Daniels, who was kicked off her parents' insurance plan when she reached 26, and started rationing insulin then. ""Nobody cared or nobody understood that without this next vial of insulin, I wouldn't live to see another week. […] I can't really explain how isolating and how terrifying it is.""It's also totally unnecessary and completely unjustified. The man who discovered insulin nearly 100 years ago, Frederick Banting, refused to patent the drug under his name. With his co-inventors James Collip and Charles Best, he sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto, because they rejected the idea that people who needed this new wonder drug to survive would not be able to afford it. Since then, this drug that has been around since 1923 has become a potent symbol of corporate greed and everything wrong with our healthcare system. Pharmaceutical companies are holding diabetes patients hostage just because they can, because they can get away with continuing to jack up prices and profits.That's in private and public healthcare systems. Since 2007, a new analysis from Kaiser Family Foundation finds, the cost of insulin in Medicare Part D has risen 840 percent. Yes, there are 3.1 million enrollees with diabetes now in Medicare, as opposed to 1.6 million in 2007, but the huge spike in costs can't be attributed just to that. In addition, ""out-of-pocket spending among all Part D enrollees on insulin quadrupled between 2007 and 2016, from $236 million to $968 million, reflecting both an increase in the number of users and price increases for insulin.""The companies are doing this because they aren't constrained by any regulation. Medicare can't even negotiate drug prices. But in making this old, critical, life-saving drug a flashpoint in the healthcare debate, the industry might have just created the wedge Democrats need to burn this system down.",https://t.co/w00mkaTHbu,others
Enhanced β-adrenergic signalling underlies an age-dependent beneficial metabolic effect of PI3K p110α inactivation in adipose tissue,"Mouse strains and maintenanceTo generate mouse lines with adipose tissue-specific deletion of PI3K p110α, mice with conditionally targeted p110α alleles (p110αFLOX)13 were crossed with transgenic mice expressing a Cre recombinase under the control of the adiponectin promoter (Adipoq–Cre)14. Both lines were in the C57BL6/J background. Experimental mice were littermates produced from crosses of Adipoq–Cre (+) p110αFLOX mice with Adipoq–Cre (−) p110αFLOX mice. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at constant temperature (20–23 °C) with ad libitum access to food and water and were fed a standard diet (2018, 18% Protein Rodent diet, Harlan Teklad) or a high-fat diet (45% calories from fat; 58V8, TestDiet).Maintenance and differentiation of hMADS cellshMADS-3 cells isolated form the prepubic fat pad of a 4-month-old male48 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 2.5 ng ml−1 human fibroblast growth factors. Adipocyte diffentiation was induced 24 h postconfluence by replacing maintenance medium with differentiation induction medium consisting of DMEM/Ham's F12 (1:1) supplemented with 5 μg ml−1 human insulin, 10 μg/ml−1 human transferrin, 0.2 nM 3,3′,5-Triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), 1 μM rosiglitazone, 100 μM isobutylmethyxanthine (IBMX) and 1 μM dexamethasone. Three days later, the medium was replaced with differentiation induction medium without IBMX and dexamethasone. Adipocytes were used in experiments upon completion of differentiation, typically 5–7 days after induction.Isolation, immortalisation and differentiation of brown pre-adipocytesInterscapular BAT was isolated from three p110αFLOX and three p110αDEL 5-week-old male mice, minced with fine scissors and digested with 1 mg ml−1 collagenase for 1 h at 37 °C. Mature adipocytes were separated from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) by centrifugation at 250g for 5 min. Pellets containing the SVF were seeded in 6-well cell culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and transduced with retroviruses carrying a plasmid encoding SV40 Large T antigen (pBabe-puro-SV40LT, Addgene plasmid no 14088). Transduced cells were selected with puromycin (2 μg ml−1) for 2 weeks. Adipocyte differentiation was induced by treating confluent cell monolayers with 1 μg ml−1 insulin, 1 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM isobutylmethyxanthine (IBMX), 1 μM rosiglitazone and 1 nM 3,3′,5-Triiodo-l-thyronine (T3). After 48 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum. Cell monolayers were used in experiments upon completion of differentiation, typically 1 week after induction.Body weight and food intake analysisBody weight was measured monthly from 4 weeks of age onwards. For food intake assays, mice were housed in small groups of 2–3 individuals and allowed to acclimatise for 2 days before the study. Food pellet and mouse body weights were measured at the beginning and end of a 3-day measurement. Results are expressed as cumulative food intake (grams of chow per kg of body weight per 3 days).Blood metabolic biomarkersBlood samples from fed or fasted (16 h) mice were collected from the tail vein with heparinized capillaries and then spun in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 5 min to pellet blood cells. Plasma was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at −80 °C until further use. Mouse plasma hormone and cytokine levels were determined by ELISA kits: Insulin, leptin and adiponectin (Crystal Chem); TNFα and Interleukin-6 (PeproTech). Triglycerides, free fatty acids and cholesterol in plasma were determined using the Infinity Triglycerides Liquid stable Reagent (TR22421; Thermo Scientific), NEFA-HR(2) kit and Cholesterol Liquid (Wako, Richmond, VA), respectively.Glucose and insulin tolerance testsGTTs and ITTs were performed on mice at different ages, fasted for 16 or 5 h, respectively. Blood glucose levels were determined at several time points (up to 120 min) after intraperitoneal injection of a glucose solution (2 g per kg of body weight) or human insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk) (0.75–2 U per kg of body weight). Blood glucose concentrations were measured in tail vein blood samples using a Contour XT glucometer (Bayer).Hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clampsHyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamps were performed in anaesthetised animals on thermally controlled pads to maintain their core body temperature. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a combination of 6.25 mg per kg acetylpromazine, 6.25 mg kg−1 midazolam and 0.31 mg kg−1 fentanyl. An infusion needle was placed into the tail vein and 6,6-D2 d-glucose (Goss Scientific) was infused at a rate of 100 nM min−1 for 80 min to achieve steady-state levels and blood samples collected on blood spot cards (Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card, SLS) to determine basal glucose turnover. Thereafter, insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk) was infused at a constant rate of 0.91 mU min−1 after a bolus dose of 16.5 mU and 6,6-D2 d-glucose infusion rate was increased to 200 nM min−1 to limit changes in enrichment levels of labelled glucose in blood. A variable infusion of 12.5% d-glucose was used to maintain blood glucose at euglycemic (basal) levels. Blood glucose was measured with an AlphaTRAK2 glucometer (Abbott Animal Health) every 5–10 min and glucose infusion adjusted accordingly. Steady state was reached after 70 min and blood samples were collected on blood spot cards at 10-min intervals over 30 min to determine steady-state enrichment levels of 6,6-D2 d-glucose. Blood samples for serum were collected at the end of the basal infusion phase and at the end of the hyperinsulinaemic phase for determination of FFAs and insulin levels during the clamp. Mice were then killed by cervical dislocation and the organs removed and frozen. Blood spots cards were extracted in 90% ethanol. Extracts underwent aldonitrile-pentaacetate derivatisation and mass spectral analysis as described in Supplementary Information. Insulin levels were determined by ELISA (Ultra Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit, Crystal Chem) and FFA levels were determined enzymatically (HR Series NEFA-HR(2), WACO)Tissue-specific glucose uptakeTissue-specific glucose uptake was determined by intraperitoneal administration of 2-[3H]-deoxyglucose (DG). Overnight fasted mice were injected with 1 g per kg d-glucose spiked with 2-[3H]-DG (12 MBq [3H]-DG (Perkin Elmer) per gram of d-glucose). Blood samples were collected from tail vein at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min following glucose injection. At the end of the time course, tissues were excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The 2-[3H]-DG uptake into tissues was determined with the Ba(OH)2/ZnSO4 precipitation method. Briefly, 100 mg of tissue samples were homogenised in 1.5 ml (or 5 μl of plasma were diluted in 0.5 ml) of 0.5% perchloric acid. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation in a benchtop microcentrifuge. One millilitre of the clarified supernatant was neutralised by addition of 50 ml each of 10% KOH and 1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0. 0.55 ml of the neutralised supernatant was transferred to a scintillation vial (designated n). The remainder 0.55 ml was precipitated by addition of 100 ml each of 0.3 N Ba(OH)2 and 0.3 N ZnSO4 and centrifugation at 16,000×g in a benchtop microcentrifuge. Totally, 0.6 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a scintillation vial (designated p). Disintegrations per minute (dpm) were measured in n and p aliquots by liquid scintillation counting. The difference in dpm between n and p represents uptake of 2-[3H]-DG. Clearance of 2-[3H]-DG and the metabolic index (Rg), as a measure of tissue-specific glucose uptake, were calculated using the following equations:$$K_{\mathrm{g}} = 2 {-}[{\,}^{3}{\mathrm{H}}] {-}_{\mathrm{tissue}} / {\mathrm{AUC}} \, 2 {-} [{\,}^{3} {\mathrm{H}}] {\mathrm{-}} {\mathrm{DG}}_{\mathrm{plasma}},$$$$R_{\mathrm{g}} = K_{\mathrm{g}} \times {\mathrm{Glucose}}_{\mathrm{plasma}},$$where 2-[3H]-DGPtissue is the 2-[3H]-DG-6-Phosphate radioactivity in the tissue in dpm per g of tissue weight, AUC 2-[3H]-DGplasma is the area under the plasma 2-[3H]-DG disappearance curve in dpm per ml per min and Glucoseplasma is the average blood glucose concentration in millimolar during the glucose excursion49.Protein extraction and immunoblot analysisMouse tissues were harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C until further processing. Samples were homogenised in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 40 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to PVDF membrane. A total of 5% non-fat milk was used to saturate the membrane prior to incubation with primary antibodies. p110α (cat. no. 4255, diluted 1:1000), p110β (cat. no. 3011, diluted 1:1000), pT308 Akt (cat. no. 2965, diluted 1:1000), pS473 (cat. no. 4060, diluted 1:1000), total Akt (cat. no. 9272, diluted 1:1,000), pS660 HSL (cat. no. 4126, diluted 1:1000), total HSL (cat. no. 4107, diluted 1:1000), phospho-PKA substrate (cat. no. 9624, diluted 1:1000), total perilipin (cat. no. 9349, diluted 1:1000), pS133 CREB (cat. no. 9191, diluted 1:1000), p T180/Y182 p38 MAPK (cat. no. 9215, diluted 1:1000) and total p38 MAPK (cat. no 9212, diluted 1:1000) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (CST). UCP1 antibody was from Abcam (cat. no. 10,983, diluted 1:1000). p85 antibody (cat. no. 06-195, diluted 1:1000) was from Millipore. Vinculin antibody (cat. no. V9264, diluted 1: 10,000) was from Sigma. PDE3b antibody (cat. no. STJ110746, diluted 1:1000) was from St. John's Laboratory. Membranes were then washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated, goat anti-Rabbit IgG (DAKO, cat. no. P0448, diluted 1:2000) and developed using ECL reagent (GE Healthcare) for radiographic film detection of p110α. Band intensity was quantified by ImageJ software. In all other cases, detection was performed with fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies (anti-mouse DyLight 800-conjugated, Rockland, cat. no. 610-145-002, diluted 1:5000 and anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 680-conjugated, Invitrogen, cat. no. A21076, diluted 1:5000), using an Odyssey CLx infra-red scanner (LICOR). Detection and quantification were performed using the manufacturer's software (Image Studio). Uncropped images of the most important blots are shown in Supplementary Information.Immunoprecipitation and PI3K assayFor immunoprecipitation and PI3K lipid kinase assay, tissue lysates were prepared as described above. Immunoprecipitation was performed by mixing lysates (2 mg of protein) with 2 μg IRS-1 antibody (Millipore, cat. no. 05-1085). Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, immune complexes were captured by addition of protein-A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and incubation for an additional 1 h. Bead-associated immune complexes were subjected to lipid kinase assays. Lipid kinase assays were performed in a total volume of 50 μl in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μM ATP (plus 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]-ATP per assay) using 200 μg ml−1 phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) as a substrate. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1 M HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The mixture was vortexed and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The lower organic phase was spotted onto thin layer silica (TLC) gel-60 plates (Merck), which had been treated with 1% oxalic acid, 1 mM EDTA in water:methanol (6:4). TLC plates were developed in a solvent consisting of propanol-1:2 M acetic acid (13:7). Images of radiolabelled lipid products were captured using a Fuji FLA-2000 phosphorimager and analysed using ImageJ software.UCP1 immunohistochemistryAdipose tissues were fixed in formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were deparaffinised, subjected to antigen unmasking (boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate pH 6 in a pressure cooker for 30 min), blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with UCP1 antibody (Abcam, cat. no. 10983) diluted 1:1000 for 16 h at 4 °C. Sections were then incubated with SignalStain© Boost IHC Detection Reagent (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 8114P) and immune complexes were visualised with SignalStain© DAB reagent (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 8059).RNA extraction and qPCRRNA was extracted from adipose tissue samples using Triazol (Thermo Fisher) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using Qiagen Omniscript RT kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using an ABI7900HT Fast Real Time PCR detection system and Power SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (ABI). Relative gene expression was quantified using the 2−ΔΔCt method. Mouse ribosomal protein S18 (rps18) was used as a loading control. A list of primers used in the present study is given in Supplementary Table 1.Lipolysis and cAMP levels in adipose tissue explantsAdipose tissue explants were adjusted to approximately 100 mg of weight and then minced with fine scissors. Explants were incubated in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator then transferred to Kreb's–Riger's buffer (30 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 10 mM NaHCO3, 120 mM NaCl, 4 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.75 mM CaCl2) supplemented with 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM glucose and incubated for an additional hour. Inhibitors were added for the last 15 min of the incubation. Lipolysis was stimulated by addition of 1 μM Isoproterenol or Norepinephrine-l-bitartate (Sigma). Totally, 50 μl of medium was removed 30 min following stimulation and glycerol content was determined using Glycerol Reagent and Glycerol Standard (Sigma). For determination of intracellular cAMP levels tissue explants were processed, incubated and stimulated as above. Explants were collected 20 min following adrenergic stimulation, frozen in dry ice and kept in −80 °C until further processing. Samples were homogenised in 0.5 ml of 0.1 N HCl using a mechanical homogeniser. Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min in a benchtop refrigerated microcentrifuge. Supernatants were diluted 1 in 4 with cAMP ELISA buffer and the cAMP content was determined with a cyclic AMP Select ELISA kit (Cayman, cat. no. 501040).Phosphodiesterase activity assayBAT-derived adipocytes were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 1 μM microcystin-LR and protease inhibitors. Lysates were briefly sonicated using a probe sonicator and were desalted using Zeba Spin desalting columns, 7 kD molecular weight cut-off (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 89882), equilibrated in PDE assay buffer. Desalted lysates (15 μg protein) were assayed for phosphodiesterase activity using a kit from Abcam (cat. no. ab139460) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Indirect calorimetryEE and norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis were measured using a Metatrace gas analyser (Creative Scientific, UK). The gas analyser uses a paramagnetic oxygen analyser and an infra-red CO2 sensor to measure oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. The analyser operates in push mode with airflow to each chamber controlled by a mass flow controller set to flow 400 ml per min. Cages were multiplexed to the analyser, with four cages being read by each analyser. For free-living EE cages were sampled for 30 s every 11 min, with a 90 s washout period between each chamber. EE was calculated from the VO2 and CO2 according to the modified Weir equation: EE (J min−1) = 15.818 × VO2 (ml min−1) + 5.176 × VCO2 (ml min−1). For NE-induced thermogenesis, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (90 mg kg−1) and placed in a 30 °C chamber. Mice were injected with 0.5 mg NE per kg. The dose of NE gave an average increase in EE of ~40% over the basal EE, while normal maximal thermogenic capacity experiments were for mice acclimated to a similar temperature a 160% increase would be expected50. Therefore, the applied NE dose fulfilled the requirement of being a sub-maximal dose and could potentially allow detection of changes in sensitivity to NE, not just changes in brown adipose tissue thermogenic capacity.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8. Specific tests are detailed in the figure legends.Study approvalAll experimental procedures complied with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and were performed with the approval of the UCL Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body.Reporting summaryFurther information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.",https://t.co/kpWcSES1QT,others
Orgenesis Announces Planned Study to Confirm Suitability of Liver Cells as a Source for Personalized Cell Replacement Therapy for Insulin-Dependent Diabetic Patients :: Orgenesis Inc. (ORGS),"Orgenesis Announces Planned Study to Confirm Suitability of Liver Cells as a Source for Personalized Cell Replacement Therapy for Insulin-Dependent Diabetic Patients Receives IRB Approval to Collect Liver Biopsies for Future Clinical Use at Israel's Rambam Medical CenterGERMANTOWN, Md., April 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orgenesis Inc. (NASDAQ: ORGS), a developer, manufacturer and service provider of advanced cell therapies, today announced it has received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to collect liver biopsies from patients at Rambam Medical Center located in Haifa, Israel for a planned study to confirm the suitability of liver cells for personalized cell replacement therapy for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes resulting from total or partial pancreatectomy. The liver cells are intended to be bio-banked for potential future clinical use. The goal of the study, entitled ""Collection of Human Liver Biopsy and Whole Blood Samples from Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), Total or Partial Pancreatectomy Patients for Potential use as an Autologous Source for Insulin Producing Cells in Future Clinical Studies,"" is to confirm the suitability of the liver cells for personalized cell replacement therapy, as well as eligibility of patients to participate in a future clinical study, as defined by successful Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cell production from their own liver biopsy. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate patients' immune response to AIPs based on the patient's blood samples and followed by subcutaneous implantation into the patients' arms, which would represent the first human trial. During the study, liver samples will be collected and then processed and stored in specialized, clinical grade tissue banks for potential clinical use. The study will enroll 20 patients and is expected to commence in May 2019. The propagated cells will be maintained in a tissue bank and are intended to be utilized in a future clinical study, in which the cells will be transdifferentiated and administered back to the patients as a potential treatment. This personalized autologous process will be performed under our Autologous Point of Care (POCare) model, in which the patient liver samples are processed, cryopreserved and potentially re-injected, all in the medical center, under clinical grade/GMP level conditions. Pancreatectomy involves the surgical removal of all or part of the pancreas, which can be required for the treatment of a variety of conditions. The incidence of diabetes following a total pancreatectomy is one hundred percent, resulting in immediate and lifelong insulin-dependence with loss of both endogenous insulin secretion and that of the counter-regulatory hormone, glucagon. Currently, Islet Autologous Transplant (TP-IAT) is considered the standard of care following TP, but this is not always a feasible treatment due to insufficient quantity of potential functional harvested islets. Orgenesis has developed a novel technology based on technology licensed from Tel Hashomer Medical Research Infrastructure and Services Ltd., utilizing liver cells as a source for Autologous Insulin Producing Cells (AIP cells) as replacement therapy for islet transplantation. AIPs are derived from liver cells that are taken by sampling from the patient liver to be treated and then converted into functional glucose-regulated IPCs and returned to the patient via injection. Due to the assumption that some of the patients, following TP or PP, will develop severe diabetes, Orgenesis' therapy has the potential to provide a long-term treatment. The study's principal investigator, Professor Naim Shehadeh, is the Director of the Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism at the Rambam Health Care Campus, and is a member of the Israel National Diabetes Council, Ministry of Health, and President of the Israel Diabetes Association. Professor Shehadeh's main research and clinical interests are pathogenesis and prevention of Type 1 Diabetes and the effect of oral insulin on the gastrointestinal tract. The study's principal surgeon and pancreatectomy specialist, Professor Yoram Kluger, is the director of the division of general surgery and the medical director of the pancreatic surgery service at Rambam Health Care Campus. Prof. Shehadeh, Rambam Medical Center, noted, ""We are excited and proud to be one of the first research sites to advance this breakthrough technology that could provide patients in the future a potential cure that could dramatically improve their quality of life."" Prof. Sarah Ferber, Orgenesis Chief Scientific Officer, commented, ""We believe that this key study, our first human trial, will allow us to better understand the autologous immune response following AIP cell implantation in different patient populations (autoimmune or not), ex-vivo and in-vivo, as well as the potency of transdifferentiation as a novel precision medicine platform to predict treatment success."" Dr. Efrat Assa-Kunik, General Manager of Orgenesis Ltd, commented, ""We believe that this IRB approval is a significant milestone in our product development process as we prepare to commence a key study, which is intended to confirm the suitability of patients' liver cells to be used as a personalized cell replacement therapy. Based on the outcome of this study, our goal is to utilize these cells in a future clinical phase I/IIa study, in which the cryopreserved cells would be administered back to the patient. If successful, we believe that both of these studies could represent major milestones for the company and, most importantly, could be transformative for patients worldwide.""

eLife Episode 55: Weaponised insulin,"What's in a name? Well if it's the person whose name is first on a paper, it's pretty important, because that tells the scientific community who, ostensibly, did most of the work. So what happens when two people share the first authorship? Who goes first? And does it make a difference if they're male, or female? Speaking with Chris Smith, Nichole Broderick…Nichole - Traditionally in biomedical literature, the first author is the person who really led the study who did the work and then the last author's name is usually the person who got the money for the study or runs the lab or institute. But we end up calling papers by that first name and that kind of sticks is something that part becomes part of our conversation and how we talk about the work.Chris - I suppose that matters, because when a person goes for a job, if they have got a string of papers with their name at the front of them and they've been at a conference presenting that work and their name is the one that everyone's aware of, their prospects can only be improved by that can't they?Nichole - It gives them that ownership and that place of being the person at the helm of that work. And so it really does indicate they've been the one driving it which can be misguided if there's another person who also was working with them, but is the second person in the name of that co-authored list.Chris - So how did you actually approach this and what did you do? Where did you get the data from to do the study?Nichole - So we honestly used Google Scholar primarily, and went and just searched for co-author or equal contribution and searched through different journals and we were able to find those papers that way. Chris - Are all of the papers where that has happened., do they state clearly that there has been a co-authorship and that authorship was shared equally - all the work was shared equally between the first second and maybe even sometimes first second and third names on that list?Nichole - We found as much as eleven!Chris - Really. Eleven first authors!Nichole - Yes! It's usually two, sometimes three, but there were some extremes. You will find somewhere, but what's interesting is that in some journals as they've moved from more of their paper versions now onto an online format, you won't necessarily see it unless you actually download the paper. So that was somewhat tricky but we were able to find them.Chris - And how many papers did you extract data for?Nichole - So we looked at around 3000 papers over a dozen different journals all in the biomedical area.Chris - And over what time span? Nichole - So we did, starting in about 1995, 97 going through 2017.Chris - Okay. And so you crunched all these numbers; you know which authors have contributed. Do you know who's a male who's a female author?Nichole - Some of the Anglo names were a bit easier for us to sort of decipher: a Bridget versus a Jonathan. But obviously science is very international. So we ended up resorting to searching for images of people, finding them on LinkedIn pages, or research gate so that we could definitively indicate whether or not they were male or female. So we had to exclude some papers where we couldn't determine that.Chris - Indeed, because there were some ""Ashleys"" and some ""Leslies"" that may well be indeterminate!Nichole - Well those we checked. We always checked.Chris - And what you're asking is: ""So we've got multiple author paper and we've got either a man and a man, a man and a woman, or a woman and a woman, as these authors upfront"". What sort of numbers did you see in terms of how did those break down. And when you actually then compared who was first and who was second, did you see numbers that were equivalent to chance, or was there bias?Nichole - What we found first of all was the male-male combination was by far the most common. And then if we looked at mixed genders, there did appear to be a bias against women in the first position. So it was more common, if it was a mixed gender paper, for there to be a male in the first position and a female in the second position.Chris - Any idea why you might be seeing that? Because when people decide the author list and they've contributed equally, sometimes they'll reach some kind of decision about alphabetical order, or they'll toss a coin. Was there any explanation offered as to why this might be the case?Nichole - The one thing that we found was interesting was we only found about one or two papers that actually said ""this order was decided by alphabetical order"". In most cases that's never indicated. If you talk to scientists, anecdotally, I think they would tell you that sometimes that flipping of a coin and stuff happens less frequently than you might expect. But we do note that over time that has gone down. We did look for what was occurring by time and it is becoming more equal.Chris - Did you phone up any of these people, where you saw this going on, to ask them or how did you reach that decision?Nichole - We hesitated to actually do a study so that we could survey for those sorts of questions; it might be an interesting follow-up that we've talked about. At the time we really wanted to get the story out so that people could talk about it and think about it.Chris - And if nothing else maybe lobby journals to say look this needs to be made clearer in the papers. If you found such a paucity of examples where this is actually explained, it kind of argues that we really ought to be putting that on the paper shouldn't we?Nichole - Exactly and that's one of the points that we make and actually we've been getting feedback from that aspect where people have told us that their journals are you know their editor in chiefs of journals that it's something that they're journals moving towards is having a very clear statement about how these decisions are made. Chris - You must be quite pleased though by the fact that as you look at the scientific timeline of publication that this effect appears to weaken?Nichole - Absolutely. It was very reassuring to see that there was a correction. Who knows exactly why but it's wonderful to see and it's great to think that we're approaching equilibrium with.Chris - With that sort of ordering it's reassuring to me, as a as a biomedical scientist, that we're in that situation. But what about these physicists? Are you going to go and probe them next to make sure that they're not being naughty?Nichole - One of the dilemmas there is just the number of women physicists that are in training it's still an area and still one of the sciences where we really need to increase the numbers. So I think that'll be one of the tricky aspects of it but obviously would be great to look at.",https://t.co/fM44ihCYGA,others
Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels,"Maintaining healthy blood sugar levelsSugar-laden diets, low physical activity and stress which are so prevalent in today's busy lifestyles, can contribute to a condition known as IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) – a condition which is often experienced prior to the onset of diabetes.1 When we experience glucose intolerance, it means that our body has reduced sensitivity to insulin and increased levels of glucose can then occur in the blood. This can have a negative effect our weight management efforts, not to mention overall health (kidney, cardiovascular and nerve damage, vision impairment).1More specifically, stress and poor diet can cause our bodies to become depleted of the important trace mineral chromium. When our chromium level is low, the body releases the hormone cortisol. Cortisol works contrary to insulin, which manages blood sugar levels, by increasing cellular resistance of insulin and also stimulates appetite and binge-eating. By supplementing with the mineral chromium, we can help the body metabolize carbohydrates and fats while providing it with support for healthy glucose metabolism.2 Healthy glucose management results in glucose being turned into cellular energy.There are several forms of chromium available for supplementation. In recent years, many companies have promoted chromium picolinate as the best source of chromium. Studies on chromium absorption, however, have shown that the bisglycinate form of chromium, a chromium niacin amino acid chelate (branded as Chromium Chelavite®), is actually better absorbed than the picolinate form. Chromium picolinate showed an absorption rate of only 37.5% compared to chromium bisglycinate at 57.5%.3 Chromium bisglycinate supplementation has been shown to reduce levels of cortisol by 19-27% in studies, increasing insulin sensitivity.3An extract of a plant-based ingredient that we are all familiar with on a daily basis, cinnamon, also has potential for helping to support healthy glucose metabolism. Several studies done on humans have shown that cinnamon is able to reduce glucose blood levels and increase insulin sensitivity, as well as lower LDL cholesterol levels.4References:1.

Memes and Game of Thrones Drama,"Thinking about Congressional hearings on the current Insulin Pricing Crisis, your first instinct may be to roll your eyes and clench your fists. But hold on a moment... What we're seeing on Capitol Hill now may be something new, Folks. We've reached a point where these Congressional hearings go beyond typical policy jargon to include intrigue and human drama that evokes hints of The Godfather, Robin Hood, and binge-worthy hits like Game of Thrones. After all, we're talking about people literally dying out there after rationing insulin because of unaffordability and lack of access.OK, the GoT comparison may seem a bit extreme, but it actually came up in last week's two days of hearing on April 9-10. I was absolutely glued to the screen, in popcorn status, on the edge of my seat in suspense -- as I followed the 2.5-hour hearing before a House investigational subcommittee on Wednesday. Before this panel were six people: three representing the Big Three Insulin Manufacturers (Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi), and three from the country's largest Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) organizations (Cigna/Express Scripts, CVS/Caremark, and OptumRx).The heated discussion brought some of us in Diabetes Online Community to tears, with people sharing emotes online in real-time to express cheers, laughs and hand-wringing as we listened to House members grill the players involved in supporting outrageously high insulin prices. We've now had four Congressional hearings in 2019 addressing insulin pricing and diabetes issues, and the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 10 was the first to bring all three insulin manufacturers together, along with PBMs, to the same panel. There was a Senate Finance Committee meeting the day prior, and a week earlier the House E&amp;C's investigational subcommittee heard testimony by D-advocates from the ADA (American Diabetes Association), JDRF, DPAC (Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition), the Endocrine Society, and longtime T1D Gail deVore from Colorado who's individually advocated on these personal #insulin4all efforts. The first hearing this year took place in January, which followed a handful of other prior hearings in recent years.In this latest session, Congressional members hammered these execs with probing questions. To put it mildly, it was pleasing to watch, even if we ended up hearing the same repeated non-answers and finger-pointing from each side of the insulin supply chain. Honestly, I'm a policy wonk so I've followed a lot of formal hearings in my day... but this felt different to me.Here's my personal recap of these unusually suspenseful hearings, including some of the best quips from Congress members: Game of Thrones, Diabetes Style A huge theme of many recent Congressional hearings on this topic has been that lawmakers were visibly irate, furious with the drug pricing players testifying before them. Last week it was clear that they came ready for a fight, and the oft-contentious hearing gave those of us in the Diabetes Community a clear sign that these elected leaders have been listening to us.Seriously, just when you thought you'd heard something that would top the drama, another member of the Congressional panel went for the one-up. It was delightfully satisfying, yet maddening. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who co-chaired the Senate Finance Committee hearing, described the PBMs as being too secretive, accusing them of guarding their negotiations with Pharma and rebate schemes ""with greater secrecy than HBO is guarding the ending of Game of Thrones."" ""If PBMs had clear, hard evidence proving that they're getting patients a better deal on prescription drugs, they'd be leafleting the countryside and shouting from the rooftops,"" Wyden said. ""Instead, they work overtime to keep patients and taxpayers in the dark.""Share on PinterestSen. Ron Wyden (D-OR)The Pharma and PBMs execs of course countered that the convoluted existing healthcare ecosystem ties their hands on adjusting pricing. Even if there are nuggets of truth to that, Congress wasn't having it. Just like us frustrated patients, the Congress-folk seemed tired of it all and angry as hell. They frequently interrupted, not interested in the same song-and-dance about how broken the system is and finger-pointing on who's to blame. Even one of the execs suggested that they should ""work together with Congress to find solutions,"" the Congress-folk weren't taking it. The effect was eye-rolling and laughable. Rep Janet Schakowsky (D-IL) was one of the most forceful, bringing Godfather-like threats into her strong wording against the Pharma and the PBM reps on the panel -- which seems fitting, given the term ""insulin pricing cartel"" that's been floating around to describe this whole issue.""How do you people sleep at night?"" she asked rhetorically, before going off on a rant about how unacceptable the situation is. ""That will not stand in this Congress. If you think you can out-talk us, without any transparency, your days are numbered.""Share on PinterestRep Janet Schakowsky (D-IL) Meme-Worthy Moments from Fed Up LawmakersUnfortunately, the bottom line is that beyond this rough grilling from lawmakers, we didn't hear anything new. The Pharma folk repeated their usual talking points on how PBM business models and rebate schemes are to blame for higher list prices (even though net prices and insulin profit is steady); while PBMs claim it's Pharma that sets high list prices for no apparent reason other than greed, and that the PBM companies pass along all rebates to their business, government and health plan clients altruistically.Uh, huh...You can get a run-down of what the company execs actually said in their pre-submitted remarks leading up to both the House and Senate hearings.But there were many memorable moments and firsts that hint at a growing no-tolerance policy from lawmakers across the aisle, aimed at both the PBMs and Pharma industries.Meme-Worthy Finger-pointing: A fave moment came when Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-MA), crossed his arms and shook his head multiple times before finally highlighting the execs' finger-pointing by jabbing out his own fingers this way and that in a meme-worthy way.Share on PinterestRep. Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-MA)Meme of Disgust: Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) had another meme-worthy moment when he was drilling into the statements and business practices of both Pharma and PBMs. He was clearly frustrated to the point where he looked like he might just toss up his papers in disgust. Then at one point while wondering why Congress doesn't just do away with PBMs or force price-controls, he just shook his head and put his hand on his face.Share on PinterestRep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ)""Reverse Robin Hood"": This was actually a phrase used by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) during the Senate Finance Committee hearing, when describing how the PBMs (and by extension, Pharma that wasn't present on that panel) gamed the system to take from the poor and give to the well-off.Share on PinterestSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA)""Political Jujitsu"": Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) had a great line about PBMs using ""political jujitsu of almost magical variety"" to transform the public pressure on Pharma's pricing policies into better messaging for its own business practices, casting these middle-men as innocent antagonists and Pharma as the main villains.Office Space: In a sense, all of this talk made me think of the movie Office Space that's marking its 20-year anniversary this year. There's a scene in which bosses, aka the ""The Bobs,"" are interviewing employees about their respective roles in the company, as part of a process leading to company layoffs. As one character is awkwardly describing his tasks, they interrupt and ask: ""What exactly do you do here?"" In a way, that's how these Congressional hearings felt, like lawmakers were trying to get at some very basic information but kept getting only disjointed talking points in response.""A Cruel Form of Torture"": Sen. Paul Tonko (D-NY) asked the execs point-blank if they had ever struggled to afford insulin themselves or known anyone personally who had to ration or may have died as a result. They all responded no, and echoed ""No one should."" This set Tonko off, to the point of saying they've all collectively played a part in ""a cruel form of torture"" in their pricing policies and use of esoteric terms like ""rebates, list prices, and Patient Assistance Programs"" that ignore the reality of this real crisis in America.Just Stop: I loved it when Rep. David McKinley (R-WV) asked posed a question to the Novo Nordisk exec, who then began what sounded like a commercial spot for Tresiba insulin, and the Congressman cut him off with, ""I don't need to be filibustered here."" NICE!Share on PinterestRep. David McKinley (R-WV)Smoke and Mirrors, etc.: Many other quote-worthy phrases popped up as well that capture what most us think about the insulin pricing system: ""smoke and mirrors,"" a ""bizarre and perverse"" system, and one Congress member noting that the entire process is a ""market failure at best"" which encourages anti-competitive behavior.There were so many more, but you'll just have to watch the hearings yourself to gauge the many high drama moments worthy of movies or cable TV series. A Bipartisan Push for Fair Drug Pricing?As noted, it was an incredible feeling watching lawmakers shake down these executives with so little tolerance for the typical blame game. Not only that, but these politicians seem to be cooperating with each other against the common enemy here. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA), who wasn't even on the House E&amp;C's subcommittee but came to make a statement, offered a point that seemed to sum the hearings up perfectly: ""I want to congratulate all of you today for accomplishing something we've been trying to do in Congress, and that is to create bipartisanship."" On the pricing madness itself he noted, ""I have witnessed it. I have seen what you've done. This is going to end.""Of course, how and when insulin prices actually come down significantly and stabilize is still TBD, because there are so many moving parts to this crisis in America. But one thing seems clear: Congress is hearing our collective voices and just like those of us in the D-Community, they're mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. That in itself is progress.It makes for great viewing and a lot of hope. Now, onward towards tangible change please...",https://t.co/E78oGzO5vK,others
Insulin Temperature Control: What You Need to Know,"Earlier this year, our own Wil Dubois landed in the ER with DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) that seemingly came out of nowhere. This was a wake-up call for him to revisit the basics of type 1 diabetes management, including the importance of keeping your insulin temperature-safe so you know it's working properly. Recognizing Spoiled Insulin What happens when you leave a chunk of raw prime rib out in the sun? Right. After a while, it starts to stink. Guess what? Insulin is the same. Just like prime rib, it's a protein. And just like prime rib, it can spoil in high temperatures.Of course, spoiled insulin doesn't smell rancid. It still smells like Band-Aids. And it doesn't change color, or give you any other clues that it's spoiled. It just stops working, or at a minimum it stops working properly, leaving you with blood sugars that start to climb and a need for multiple correction doses that just don't seem to be making any impact. You probably knew that, or at least you probably did at one time. But do you know how hot is too hot? Or how long insulin can beat the heat? There are many options nowadays to keep our insulin at ideal temps whether we're at home, traveling on planes and trains, or out in the wild where weather extremes can present different medication challenges.Share on Pinterest What's the Best Temperature to Store Insulin? The three major insulin makers -- Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi -- tell us that ""refrigeration temperatures between 36° and 46°F are maintained for insulin products during the manufacturing process"" and that remains the recommended range. They also warn strongly against putting insulin in the freezer, or directly adjacent to the refrigerator cooling element, as freezing renders insulin immediately ineffective. According to Consumer Reports, the sweet spot for a kitchen fridge is 37° F -- apparently ideal for keeping veggies like lettuce free of ice crystals, while suppressing the spread of bacteria. But that's pretty close to the bottom of the ideal insulin temp range, so we need to be careful. Many people with diabetes have a habit of taking their insulin directly from the pharmacy to the kitchen fridge. While this is generally good enough, it's important to be alert to colder corners and know that the overall temperature of a full fridge can be lower than the temperature in a nearly empty one. The butter compartment generally remains a good choice of fridge placement for insulin, as it turns out. Now let's turn to the specific insulin you may be using. Target Temperatures, by Insulin Brand and TypeDo different insulins have different recommended temperatures for safe storage? Starting with Novo Nordisk, the company that makes more kinds of insulin than anyone else, here's the official word on product storage:Long-acting (basal) insulin Levemir, should be kept in a refrigerator at that sweet spot between 36° and 46° Fahrenheit. Novo tells us that once unopened, vials or pens can be kept safely at room temperature so long as they are protected from heat sources and direct sunlight, and that the medicine will still function for up to 42 days. Apparently, on day 43, it turns into a pumpkin. Wait, what? How is room temp defined? Well, the problem may be that Novo Nordisk is a Danish company, and it's cooler in Denmark than in Phoenix, Arizona, or lots of other places. Their official safe room temp for insulin no hotter than 86° F. Meanwhile, open in-use pens and vials, ""must NOT be stored in a refrigerator"" (the capital letter emphasis is Novo's), and have the same 42-day life that unopened room temp Levemir has. Fast-acting (bolus) insulin Novolog has the same temperature ranges, for both unopened or in use, but a shorter (Danish) room temperature lifespan: 28 days. It also has an additional interesting note: Six-days max life in an insulin pump reservoir, unless exposed to temperatures in excess of 98.6° F, in which case it needs to be pitched out.Pumpers: Don't snuggle up with someone running a mild fever. OK, and what about the newest insulin formulations from Novo? Are they more robust than our old standbys? Nope. Ultra fasting-acting Fiasp has the exact same recommendations as Novolog. Ultra long-acting basal insulin Tresiba has the same temps and rules as Levemir, except it apparently lasts a full 56 days at Danish room temps. What about other brands and formulations? They all have the same 36° to 46° range: Sanofi's fasting-acting Apidra, and Lilly's long-acting Humalog/Admelog, Lantus/Basaglar, and Toujeo.What about insulin mixes? And non-insulin injectable diabetes medications? Yup, they all recommend exactly the same temperature range for safe storage. Just flip to section 16 of the Prescribing Information sheet (basically the Bible for each med) to confirm its ideal temperature range. Still, just for fun, let's look at old-school insulin. Was pioneer insulin tougher?Looking at the data for Novolin R and N—the forerunners of the forerunners of today's insulins—they too, have the magic 36° and 46° F range, but I guess due to global warming, room temps were cooler back then: 77 degrees. And what about farther back in time? How about animal insulin? We couldn't find any data for them online (as these insulins predate the Internet), but Merck's Vetsulin, a pig-based veterinary insulin for cats and dogs, interestingly, it has the exact same temp range. We queried all the major insulin players on where this temperature standard originated, but didn't get much information. Novo was the only company to respond, with their Director of Diabetes Communications Michael Bachner writing to say he was unable to locate any sources on why storage temperature ""hasn't changed over the years with newer insulin formulations."" Tools for Keeping Insulin CoolThe good news is that working insulin—the open vials and pens you're actively using—doesn't need to be kept cool. In use, there's no benefit to actually keeping insulin cold. It will neither prolong its life nor make it work better, plus cold insulin stings when you inject it. The trick is not so much keeping your open insulin cool when in use, but rather, to not let it get hot.To do this, you just need to make sure your house, work place, car, purse/go-bag, and pocket never get hotter than the top level of Danish room temperature (than 86° F), which nearly every house, work place, car, purse/go-bag, and pocket is sure to hit in the summer here in the USA.So what to do?Ice packs were the traditional solution. But while ice packs are great for post-surgical swelling, and may yet be useful in treating hangovers, as a means of keeping insulin cool they're woefully ineffective. The ice melts quickly, they're messy, plus they actually keep insulin cooler than it needs to be, at least for working insulin. Ice packs might be a good solution for transporting an inventory of insulin for an extended vacation, but that's about it.Thankfully there are some great products to help solve this problem: Medicool, which has been around for quite a while, specializes in a wide range of insulated coolers with a molded insert that needs to be frozen, then re-frozen to be used again. It's a small step up from an ice bag, at least in terms of being less messy, but refreezing takes time. The company also sells a small portable refrigerator.Personally, I'm a big fan of the Frio cooling wallets, which are light, simple, compact, and easy to use. They use evaporative cooling to keep insulin in that sub-80 range for 48 hours, even when the outside temps are well above 100 degrees. To re-use, you just soak the inner sleeve in water and you're good to go. Frios have the advantage of working in reverse, too, protecting insulin from getting too cold in freezing weather.Zhengzhou Dison Electric Co, Ltd. makes a variety of models of portable refrigerators for medicine. How large a variety? How does 62 different models sound to you?A new trend in insulin temp control is the use of stainless thermos technology such as the Insulin Safe and its cousins, which can be found on Amazon, eBay, and Aliexpress/Alibaba. The novel Vivi products replace the cap of most of the disposable insulin pens on the market, and use phase change material to keep insulin at steady temps for up to 12 hours without electricity, water, or refrigeration. It magically starts working at around 84° and holds the insulin at 82° for either one or two days, depending on the model. They also make a version of their device for insulin vials.MedAngel, a compact Bluetooth thermometer you can use to monitor the temperature of your insulin stash while you're traveling.So while you can't leave a chunk of raw prime rib lying around in the sun for too long, you can throw it into your freezer, and thaw it out months later for a good meal.

Klinefelter syndrome, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes: review of literature and clinical perspectives. Endocrine, 61(2), pp. 194–203.Abstract: Klinefelter syndrome (KS), the most frequent chromosomic abnormality in males, is associated with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The mechanisms involved in increasing risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality arenot completely understood. Insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes are more frequently diagnosed in KS than in the general population; however, the contribution of hypogonadism to metabolic derangement is highly controversial. Whether this dangerouscombination of risk factors fully explains the CVD burden of KS patients remains unclear. In addition, testosterone replacement therapy only exerts a marginal action on the CVD system. This review summaries the current understandings of the complex relationship between KS, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk in order to plan future studies and improve current strategies to reduce mortality in this high-risk population. Since fat accumulation and distribution seem to play a relevant role in triggering metabolic abnormalities, an early diagnosis and a tailored interventionstrategy with drugs aimed at targeting excessive visceral fat deposition appear necessary in patients with KS.Description: This is a post-peer-review, pre-copyedit version of an article published in Endocrine.

Olivier Langlois,"Little is known about the connection between testosterone levels and insulin sensitivity in men, in contrast to the abundant literature on this relationship in women. It is already demonstrated the inverse relationship between testosterone and fasting insulin levels in men independent of age, obesity, and body fat distribution. A connection between testosterone deficiency and diabetes has also been suggested with the demonstration that men with type 2 diabetes have lower testosterone levels than weight-matched nondiabetic control subjects. In addition, low testosterone levels predict the development of type 2 diabetes in men. Also, it is demonstrated a positive relationship between total testosterone levels and insulin sensitivity in normal and diabetic men. In contrast, data on the relationship between free testosterone levels and insulin sensitivity are conflicting, with some studies showing no correlation, whereas a third study demonstrates a weak positive relationship.Given that low testosterone levels predict the development of type 2 diabetes in men and that aging is accompanied by insulin resistance and a decline in testosterone secretion. Testosterone is a key modulator of insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function in men. Thus, it is examined the relationship between serum testosterone levels and insulin sensitivity in men across a wide spectrum of insulin sensitivity, dissect the role of obesity and alterations in sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) levels in mediating this relationship, and determine if there is an association between serum testosterone levels and mitochondrial function.But What About Sugar Cravings?A good question is this ... why is it so hard to stop sugar cravings? Sugar is practically a naturally occurring carbohydrate that supplies energy to the body in the form of glucose and fructose. Processed food and sugar are as addictive as drugs like cocaine or heroin. For that reason, when the body feeds low on calorie, it tries to catch up on fuel by eating something sweet. Calories are the king of real energy. So it is best taken in the form of whole foods like guacamole, falafel salad, etc.Stop Sugar Cravings – Ditch Sugar for Higher Levels of TestosteroneSugar cravings are more driven by the brain's need for reward more than the body's need for food.More tasting foods are boosting the energy levels and mood alters the brains chemistry. Hence, this boosts the levels of serotonin and endorphins. When the body intakes an overdose of sugar, it gets stored in the fat cells instead of the muscles. The organs, muscle and the brain all need sugar to function. Also, sugar is important to have proper blood sugar levels in the body.For the FinalMen with hypogonadal testosterone levels are twice as insulin resistant as their eugonadal counterparts, and 90% fulfill criteria for the metabolic syndrome.We are all aware that sugar is a carbohydrate. Consumption of carbohydrates releases the feel-good chemical serotonin and boosts a feeling of craving. You cannot stop sugar cravings in one go. Moreover, combining a sweet with a nutritious option reverses the harmful impact of sugar. For an instance, dipping a banana in organic peanut butter. Simply ensure you never skip meals as it lowers blood sugar levels. Thus snack on portions of whole foods like nuts, beans, low-fat dairy products, etc.",https://t.co/ONLoCmljdG,others
Managing Diabetes with Insulin Pumps,"It was not an easy journey. It involved a lot of trial and error, many, many blood glucose tests, and fine tuning insulin. He switched between an insulin pump and multiple daily injections depending on his training regimen. Talk about keeping up with details! Now, this Olympic Hall of Fame athlete is quite an advocate for people with diabetes (and he is still on a pump). Let's look at how water activities would play into using an insulin pump…The pumps with tubing vary from being water tight to water proof at certain depths. If a patient falls into the pool, he won't immediately damage that expensive little computer. But he wouldn't necessarily go scuba diving with it on if it's only water tight. That doesn't mean patients have to give up water activities. Infusion sets are designed with a quick release mechanism that makes it easy to take the pump off for a short period of time. Just remember that the longer patients are disconnected from the pump, the higher the risk of hyperglycemia.Of note, the Omnipod system is water proof. Since there is no tubing, it's an ideal option for active kids and adults who do water activities.Hot tubs, steam rooms, and saunas are different stories. Patients definitely don't want to take pumps into these places! The temps are way too high and can not only damage insulin but can cause pumps to malfunction. Instead, patients can disconnect from their pumps and leave them at room temperature while they enjoy the heat.Wait a minute…patients can be disconnected from their insulin!?!Most people can be disconnected from the pump for up to 1 hour to allow for water activities, showers, and intimacy. But again, the longer they are disconnected, the more at risk they are for hyperglycemia.A little side note - here are some other well-known celebs who use insulin pumps:Jay Cutler - Chicago Bears quarterbackBret Michaels - lead singer for PoisonNick Jonas - lead singer for The Jonas BrothersMary Tyler Moore - actressNicole Johnson - Miss America 1999Myth or Truth #8: Insulin pumps have to be replaced every 1-2 years. MYTH!Insulin pumps with tubing are considered durable medical equipment (DME). Most companies warranty their pumps for 4 years. That means that unless there is a malfunction or recall, the patient can't upgrade or switch companies for 4 years without paying out-of-pocket (depending on deductibles). Speaking of malfunctioning…. While the pump is still in warranty, most pump companies will ship out a replacement pump within 24 hours if a malfunction occurs. Some companies even have programs that allow you to 'rent' an extra pump for extended out-of-country vacations. Having a back-up pump when you are on safari in Tanzania would be very comforting!When patients are considering transitioning to insulin pump therapy, it's best to meet with a CDE and/or insulin pump trainer who can show them several different pump options. There are pros and cons to each brand, and the decision should be based on the needs and preferences of the patient—not the CDE, pump trainer, or MD.Myth or Truth #9: Using an insulin pump during periods of illness requires pre-planning.TRUTH! Planning ahead for sick days is a critical part of safe insulin pump management. A few safety tips include the following:Change the battery on schedule. Don't wait for it to alarm with low battery. The Tandem products are charged like a phone, so consider keeping a battery back-up on hand for power outages.Change the infusion set and reservoir every 72 hours, and keep enough supplies for 2-3 weeks. Deliveries may be delayed.Have pump settings written down and kept handy (e.g., a wallet card) in case of malfunction or unexpected hospital admission.Have a back-up plan for using MDI in case of a pump malfunction. Also, keep syringes, insulin vials or pens, and pen needles on hand, and check insulin expiration dates periodically. Unopened insulin vials and pens can be kept refrigerated and used until the manufacturer's expiration date on the box.Keep medical emergency contact numbers accessible for family.Always be prepared for hypoglycemia.Discuss sick day management with the care team ahead of time, and have a written plan to share with family members.Check insertion site regularly for irritation, bleeding, or leakage.If BG is abnormally high, take a correction dose of insulin with the pump, and test again in one to two hours. If it remains elevated, take an injection by syringe to correct the high blood glucose, and change out the tubing, reservoir, and site. Keep a close watch to see if this works for future doses.Keep ketone testing monitor or urine ketone strips on hand for elevated BG (and make sure they are not expired!).A note about hospital admissions and insulin pumps…Most hospitals have a policy in place about patients using insulin pumps during a hospital stay. In all honesty, a majority of hospital physicians and nurses are unfamiliar with the intricacies of insulin pump therapy and are of little assistance to the patient. As such, hospital policies may state that the patient is allowed to continue to use a home insulin pump during the admission as long as they are able to self-manage. This means that the patient cannot be altered by medications (anesthesia) or illness (stroke, head injury, etc). Some hospitals also allow family members to be responsible for dose adjustments and tubing/reservoir changes. But the family would need to be present at all times. Many policies include a patient 'contract' that lists the criteria for safe use while in the hospital. The contracts usually state that the patient has to provide all supplies for the pump. Remind patients about bringing at least 3 extra sets of pump supplies with them for planned hospital admissions if they plan to continue using the insulin pump. This includes bringing tubing, reservoirs, insertion devices, insulin, batteries, charging cord, etc. Hospitals do NOT stock these supplies. Also of note, hospitals cannot allow patients to use their own BG meter to determine insulin doses during an admission. Regulatory agencies dictate specific quality control processes for lab equipment. Since the patient's own meter does not follow these quality control processes, the data is not supported for care decisions. So the patient's glucose is checked using the hospital meter. Then the patient manually enters the glucose value into their home pump to determine the bolus dose. Manually entering the glucose does not change how the pump calculates a bolus dose. It's just an extra step for the patient.Given the complexity and requirements for use, the medical team may opt to have the pump temporarily removed and the patient transitioned to MDI or an IV insulin infusion during the hospital stay. It's not always ideal for glucose control, but it may be the safest option depending on the status of the patient. Myth or Truth #10: Insulin pumps are easy to use and require little training. TRUTH…and MYTH?",https://t.co/gsFrXcE07n,others
Milton Alvis's answer to What is insulin resistance?,"Insulin resistance, crucial to lifelong health, means cells which used to respond to insulin and Amylin (especially liver and muscle cells) no longer respond as well.A huge range of variance in response exists, very high responsiveness is optimally healthy; reduced responsiveness is always characteristic of advanced disease.Why would this happen?Answer: The cells would become sick and die if they responded to insulin as well as previously; when healthier.What does insulin do?Answer: It is one of two small protein signaling proteins (the other is amylin) produced by the Beta cells of the Islets of Langerhans within the pancreas, always released in a fixed ratio, under both local and especially brain control (many specifics still poorly understood), that induce responses in other cells to lower glucose concentrations [optimal average of 100 mg/dL (HbA1C=5.0%, or lower) from human observational studies without treatments, despite many medical disease industry references which indicate higher is OK] in body water.Do either insulin or amylin directly reduce glucose concentrations?They are only endocrine hormones which (like all endocrine hormones) which may alter the activity of other cells.What is the response of cells which express insulin receptors on their outer cell membrane?Answer: These receptors relay the momentary insulin binding from their external receptor to internal cell signaling pathways which MAY result in internal membranes containing glucose transporter proteins being moved and fused into the outer cell membrane elsewhere (from the insulin receptor) on the surface of the cell. The glucose transporter proteins allow glucose to move from the water outside the cell into the water inside the cell. Without glucose transporter proteins within the outer cell membrane, glucose and other charged molecules will NOT pass through the two layers of fat molecules (phopholipid and cholesterol) of which all animal cells are primarily constructed, called a lipid bilayer, i.e. all cell are microscopic fat organized water droplets and all life on the planet is based on fat organized water droplets.Why would a cell which, when very healthy, expresses insulin receptors on its outer fat membrane no longer either express as many insulin receptors or insulin receptor binding no longer result on glucose transporter proteins being moved into the outer lipid bilayer?Answer: Because it is already overloaded with glucose: more than it needs, can burn or store as glycogen.What would induce cells to become insulin resistant?Answer: The unhealthy sugar overload inducing Low Fat Diet, as promoted by Ancel Keys and George McGovern, versus Nutritional Ketosis, long verified to be vastly healthier for humans, a fundamental adaptation which allowed humans to develop a larger, more energy intensive, critical for survival organ, the human brain.What is the most effective fuel for brain cells? Answer: Sugar or Fat? Definitely Fat! Yet the brain has little access to fat if the body owner keeps choosing low fat foods.Do these same issues apply to a huge number of other common human disease which have greatly increased over the last half century on the Western diet? Answer: Absolutely!Then why has the US Gov, USDA, NIH, AHA, ADA, Big Food and the medical disease industry long promoted, indeed still largely do? Answer: (You can likely figure this one out for yourself with some accuracy.)I would suggest study some of the work of Stephen Phinney, an MD and PhD, a researcher who has long studied these issues, along with a huge number or other online resources such as DietDoctor, Low Carb Down Under, etc.I hope this helped.",https://t.co/I6qATf06G1,others
US Lawmakers Hone in on PBM Role in Insulin Prices,"US lawmakers are focusing on the role that pharmaceutical middlemen may play in the rising cost of insulin, which is making the critical drug unaffordable for many people with diabetes. Influential members of Congress from both parties say they will work together to try to put insulin within financial reach of more Americans. It's estimated that around 7.5 million Americans are taking insulin, including 1.2 million who have type 1 diabetes and require daily insulin. Type 2 diabetes, which affects nearly 30 million Americans according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), is treated with a variety of other medications but many of those patients may also eventually become dependent on insulin. In letters released yesterday, leaders of the Senate Finance Committee demanded detailed information from three of the nation's biggest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs): Cigna's Express Scripts, CVS Health Corp, and UnitedHealth's Optum unit. The senators want to bring into the light the often unseen mechanisms that let PBMs profit from serving as a go-between on insulin prescriptions between patients and manufacturers. ""Even though insulin has been used to treat diabetes for almost 100 years, its price has continued to increase, putting stress on patients and taxpayers alike,"" wrote Senate Finance Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee's ranking Democrat. The information demanded by Grassley and Wyden will likely frame the debate for an April 9 Senate Finance hearing on PBMs. Senate Finance has also summoned executives from Humana and Prime Therapeutics to appear at the hearing. And in the House of Representatives yesterday, a hearing with diabetes experts also set the stage for an expected deeper examination of insulin costs later this month. Prices for commonly prescribed insulins rose over the past two decades from about $20 per vial to over $250 per vial — a more than 700% increase after adjusting for inflation, said the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee in a background memo for the hearing. Spiraling insulin prices reflect poorly on the work of PBMs as negotiators, at least when it comes to serving patients, according to Rep. Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter (R-GA), who owns drugstores in his community and describes himself as Congress' only pharmacist. ""Their mission is to keep prescription drug prices low,"" Carter said at the hearing. ""Well, I would ask you, 'How's that working out?' Obviously, it's not working out very well at all."" Call for More Transparency Around PBM Pricing Strategies Like the Senate Finance Committee, Carter argues for a need for greater information about the rebates paid to PBMs. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed a plan to allow discounts on prescription medicines to flow more directly to patients in the Medicare Part D pharmacy program, while disrupting the flow of rebates to PBMs. Carter and his Democratic and Republican colleagues want more open access to information about PBMs' rebates, price concessions, and other direct or indirect remuneration in prescription drug plans. The House Energy and Commerce's Health Subcommittee last month approved a bill to increase transparency in drug pricing that Carter had put forward with Democratic and GOP colleagues. It would provide the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission with more access to data on rebates, a step that could aid Congress with future PBM legislation. ""When you have three PBMs that control almost 80% of the market, I don't think we have enough competition in that area,"" Carter said. ""We need transparency. It's the only way that we're ever going to see exactly how we attack this problem that impacts everyone. It is a nonpartisan problem."" There's deep shared interest among Democrats and Republicans in Congress in addressing drug costs, with insulin a particular cause of concern. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, said she and her GOP counterpart on the panel had planned yesterday's hearing together. She and Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, the panel's ranking Republican, had agreed on the selection of witnesses. That's a break from tradition, in which the minority party usually gets to weigh in on only one choice of a witness for a hearing, DeGette said. DeGette has a notable track record for helping bring both parties together to pass health law. She was a key lawmaker behind the 2016 passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, a law meant to aid biomedical research. DeGette has cited her daughter's type 1 diabetes as one of her reasons for championing that measure. ""We are committed to fixing this,"" said DeGette at the hearing on insulin prices. ""We are committed to a bipartisan solution."" Why Can't CMS Pay for Insulin? A perhaps more surprising example of bipartisanship at the hearing was a quick endorsement from Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a liberal Democrat from Illinois, for an idea tossed out by Rep. Michael C. Burgess, MD, a conservative Republican from Texas. Burgess suggested having Medicare and Medicaid pick up the tab for insulin for patients with diabetes. Burgess and Schakowsky spoke of this idea as a potential cost saver for these programs, sparing them from having to pay to treat complications people suffer because of poorly controlled diabetes. ""Why do we even charge for insulin? If someone has got a diagnosis of diabetes, why not just treat it?"" Burgess said. ""Why would the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] not just cover that?"" Skipping doses of insulin because of cost puts people at risk for ""devastating and sometimes deadly complications,"" including cardiovascular and kidney disease, blindness, and lower-limb amputations, William T. Cefalu, MD, chief scientific and medical officer of the ADA, told the House panel. ""The amount of money a person pays for insulin is going to have a direct effect on their adherence,"" Cefalu said in reply to Burgess' suggestion. ""Whatever we can do to lower the cost of insulin is going to increase adherence."" Burgess noted that Energy and Commerce has jurisdiction for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. He said he intended to follow up with CMS Administrator Seema Verma on the idea of providing insulin without charging patients in government health plans. ""In a federal program, why don't we just cover it?"" Burgess wondered. ""That's a question that I think this committee in Congress needs to ask,"" replied Cefalu. Sellers' Market: Patients Skimping on Insulin a Common Occurrence In his testimony, Cefalu also urged Congress to have the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) further streamline the process for clearing so-called biosimilar insulins. Prices for these copycat versions of pricier insulin analogs won't drop until there are several potential rivals that can be substituted for the brand-name version, he said. The FDA has also announced a May 13 public hearing about steps needed to bring more competition to the insulin market. As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, there has been some reluctance on the part of physicians and patients to switch to biosimilars. Although biosimilar insulins are cheaper than branded insulins, the prices have not yet been low enough to make changing products enticing in some cases. ""While the regulatory transition of insulin products nears, we're cognizant of the fact that it won't be soon enough for the millions of Americans who struggle to pay for their insulin today,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said in a statement. ""We all need to do our part. A drug that's nearly a century old should not have a list price that increases between 15% to 17% annually."" At the House hearing, Kasia Lipska, MD, MHS, of Yale-New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, spoke about her published research that found one in four insulin-treated patients surveyed at the Yale Diabetes Center rationed their insulin because of cost. Lipska told the House Energy &amp; Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations panel these results indicate the phenomenon of people skimping on insulin is common nationwide. And Rep. Raul Ruiz, MD, (D-CA) told his colleagues on the Energy and Commerce panel about having seen this phenomenon in both his own family and his own practice, as an emergency room physician. Patients who are not yet suffering ill effects or diabetes complications may be unwilling to pay for insulin, putting themselves at risk, he said. ""I've done talks about how this is the silent killer,"" Ruiz said. He explained how he has struggled to persuade his uncle, who has diabetes, to take adequate insulin. Ruiz said his uncle rebuffs the advice, saying he'd rather put his money toward buying groceries and filling his gas tank to get to work. In the ER, Ruiz said he saw people who had fallen into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic comas because of missing insulin doses, and he said he has treated people for pain caused by neuropathy and cardiac arrest. And through his work as a community activist, he has witnessed the struggles of people to come up with the money for insulin. He said he once encountered an elderly woman rummaging through trash. She told him she was looking for aluminum cans, for which she could collect rebates. The money she earned this way would pay for insulin. Ruiz said the woman tried to reassure him about her situation. ""'Don't worry, doctor,' she told me. 'Don't worry. I only take half a dose, so it can last,'"" Ruiz recalled. Ask the Tough Questions: Why Has the Price of Insulin Skyrocketed? Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-CA), who also has family members with diabetes, said lawmakers must act quickly to address the forces that are putting insulin beyond the reach of many Americans. ""Something is broken and people look to Congress"" to fix it, Barragán said, calling for a hearing with representatives of PBMs and insulin makers as witnesses. ""I want us to ask the tough questions,"" she said. ""We've got to get down to why this is happening. Why is it that [the price of] insulin has skyrocketed?"" Barragán said Congress should also act to assuage public concerns about lawmakers' financial ties to drugmakers, noting that many Americans think Congress has failed to do much on drug prices because of the lobbying influence of drugmakers. The pharmaceutical industry has been a significant contributor for many years to congressional campaigns of both Democratic and Republican candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonprofit group based in Washington. ""We have to come together to show that we don't care about the lobby, we don't care about private industry in the sense that we are colluding with them, because sometimes the American people think that,"" she observed. Barragán seemed to have missed an earlier comment from DeGette, who said her panel will call executives from three insulin makers to appear at a hearing. She did not immediately name the companies whose representatives she has summoned. But, given her comment, it appears likely that she meant the three big insulin manufacturers, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk. At the hearing, DeGette asked permission to interrupt Barragán as the junior member of the committee argued for a need to call a hearing with drugmakers and PBMs. ""We're bringing them in next week,"" DeGette told Barragán, who replied ""Fantastic."" ""You're welcome,"" DeGette said. For more diabetes and endocrinology news, follow us on Twitter and on Facebook.",https://t.co/A1qt7IuebC,others
Conference Highlights: AACE 2019,"New research was presented at AACE 2019, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Annual Scientific &amp; Clinical Congress, from April 34-28 in Los Angeles. The features below highlight some of the studies that emerged from the conference. Trabecular Bone Score by Hemodialysis StatusPrior research suggests that bone mineral density (BMD) is not as useful in predicting fracture risk in patients on permanent hemodialysis (HD) as it is in the general population. And while trabecular bone score (TBS) has been shown to be an independent risk factor for fracture in the general population, the value of TBS in HD patients remains unclear. Researchers conducted a study to assess BMD and lumbar spine (LS) TBS in HD patients compared with those of people with normal kidney function matched for age, gender, and LS BMD. TBS was significantly lower in HD patients, independent of BMD. Lower TBS reflected changes and damage in bone microarhitecture that occur in patients on permanent HD and could explain the increased risk of fracture at these patients. The absolute 10-year major and hip osteoporotic fracture risk was significantly increased in HD patients compared with controls due to lower femoral neck BMD.—————————————————————- Precursors of Adrenal Tumors &amp; Cushing's SyndromeSystematic studies of the clinical applicability of serum steroid precursors measured with currently available assays are lacking. To evaluate the diagnostic value and clinical utility of such precursors in a prospective cohort of patients with adrenal tumors and Cushing's syndrome (CS), researchers measured 11-deoxycortisol (DCORT), 17-Hydroxypregnenolone (17OHPreg), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHProg), Pregnenolone (PREG), Androstenedione (ANDRO), Dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate (DHEAS), and cortisol in adults with any type of CS or adrenal mass. Participants with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) had 2.5 to 12 times higher concentrations of 17OHPreg, 17OHProg, DHEAS, PREG, ANDRO, and DCORT than those with other adrenal tumors. A multivariable model of 17OHPreg, 17OHProg, and DCORT accurately predicted ACC. 17OHPreg and DHEAS were lowest and DCORT was highest in patients with CS when compared with those with mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) and non-functioning adrenal tumors (NFAT). In patients with MACS versus NFAT only, 17OHPreg was a significant predictor of MACS in a multivariable model. Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent CS had lower 17OHPreg and DHEAS than those with ACTH-dependent CS. In patients with ACTH-dependent CS, those with ectopic CS had higher DCORT and 17OHProg, with DCORT significantly predicting ectopic CS, even after correcting for cortisol concentrations. —————————————————————- Detecting Parathyroid AdenomasResearch is limited comparing the accuracy of 18F-fluorocholine positron-emission tomography/CT (PET) with that of both technetium sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (MIBI) and high-resolution neck ultrasound (US) in the preoperative detection of parathyroid adenoma (PA) in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). To do so, study investigators considered the finding of an enlarged/hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland in at least in two of three imaging techniques among patients with PHPT who underwent US, MIBI, and PET. Detection rates for PA were 73% for PET, 40% for MIBI, and 60% for US. Approximate concordant positive results were 23% for PET-MIBI, 47% for PET-US, and 30% for MIBI-US. Approximate concordant negative results were 10% for PET-MIBI, 13% for PET-US, and 275 for MIBI-US 26.7%. Among the 90% of patients who recovered after surgery, PET detected PA in 100%, while MIBI and US found PA in 22% and 67%, respectively.—————————————————————- Assessing a 24-Hour Wearable Insulin-Delivery DeviceWith few previous studies evaluating the impact of a 24-hour wearable basal-bolus insulin-delivery device on clinical outcomes, researchers evaluated change in A1C, insulin total daily dose (TDD), concomitant non-insulin glucose-lowering medications (NIGLM), reported hypoglycemia, and weight among patients of a large, specialized diabetes center who exceeded glycemic targets; were prescribed basal-bolus multiple daily injection insulin (MDI), basal insulin, premix insulin, or no insulin at baseline; and were changed to the wearable device. After a mean of 5 months of wearable device use, all patients and cohorts experienced reductions in A1C, including changes of -1.5 for all patients, -1.5 for the MDI group, -1.3 for the basal insulin group, -0.6 for the premix group, and -3.3 for the insulin naïve group. Across all patients previously prescribed insulin, insulin TDD decreased from 63 to 54 units per day.—————————————————————- Diabetes &amp; Long-Term Fracture RiskAlthough older adults with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for fracture when compared with those without the condition, the former tend to have normal-to-high bone mineral density (BMD). Knowledge of imminent or short-term fracture risk in those with T2D is lacking. For a study, the association of T2D with fracture incidence over short- and long-term risk of fracture in a community-based cohort was evaluated. Incident fractures excluded finger, toe, skull, face, and pathologic fractures. The study authors used repeated measures analyses to estimate hazard ratios (HRs, 95% CIs) for the association between T2D, T2D medication use, and T2D duration and incident fracture, adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight. Follow-up time was calculated from baseline to the first of: fracture, death, loss, or end of follow-up in 2009. Among women, the cumulative incidence of fracture was 37% for those with T2D, compared with 30% for those without T2D. Among men, these rates were 11% and 16%, respectively. T2D was associated with 1-year fracture risk in women (HR, 2.23) but not in men. Among all participants, longer duration of T2D (HR, 1.28 per 5 years) and any T2D medication use (HR, 1.70) increased 2-year fracture risk. Associations between T2D and long-term incidence of fracture were not significant. The researchers note that competing risk of death may have resulted in them underestimating associations with long-term fracture.",https://t.co/cFTlmZYrix,others

Pushing diabetics to take insulin is a medical scam: Fiona Godlee,"Fiona Godlee, the first woman editor of the BMJ (originally called the British Medical Journal), is no ivory-tower academic. A crusader for medical ethics, Godlee is known for blasting governments for being lax, taking on global pharma giants such as Roche and GlaxoSmithKline for reportedly hiding trial data, speaking fearlessly against corruption in science, and championing the cause of patient-centric healthcare. In India to attend the BMJ South Asia Awards 2016, Godlee talks to Economic Times on a wide range of issues, from air pollution to corruption in medicine and the work that the BMJ does in the country. Edited excerpts: How does it feel to breathe the most polluted air in India? (Laughs) I love this country. It's a wonderful place and am coming back here after two years. The air now looks a lot better from what I read and saw a few days back. To look at the positive side of things, air pollution is back on the agenda of the people. You have to make the public aware and the governments accountable for moving us away from burning fossil fuel. Your recent report reveals that most of the people with diabetes in India are largely dependent on foreign-made insulin, which is expensive… There are certain things which are not going right. To put patients on insulin is a big push by industry and the doctors who in turn are influenced by the industry. Rather than tackling the lifestyle issues, going straight to insulin is not the right option. That is a big worry because insulin is not without its harm and is expensive in India. I think it's a medical scam, an industry scam. Patients think that this is the best drug for them, and they need to pay for it or else they would die, and a very big group of people are vulnerable to it. I think we need to speak out against the pressure to put people on insulin. With diabetes becoming such an epidemic in India, we need to look at the root causes and put money there rather than putting people on insulin. Is there a parallel in terms of rising caesarean births in India rather than normal delivery? Caesarean births are a problem globally, and not just in India. It's more convenient for the doctor, who also gets paid more, and people are encouraged to think it's safer. In some cases, it may be true but not in all cases. It's not a riskfree procedure: anaesthetics, surgery, medical cost, long time of recovery and even more difficulty in having subsequent babies. It's a global issue. What's your take on corruption in medicine? Again, it is a global phenomenon, not just confined to India. There's corruption in medicine globally. But if you have a system where doctors are paid more to do more, then you are going to end up with a system which seems to reward that kind of behaviour. If so, then it's going to get much more likely that doctors would tend to push more for surgery, for investigations… kickbacks encourage more such behaviour. And, on the positive side, there are doctors in India who have started speaking against this. Consumer activism too is missing in India… That may be the case. Consumer activism is a huge potential benefit if we can harness it in a big way. We need to educate people that more is not better, more medicine can be worse. They need to ask questions, take second opinion, ask about the benefits of treatment. The same thing can be done regarding air pollution. Awareness has to be created. Hard questions need to be asked. There needs to be a cultural shift where doctors and patients are much like partners. You first came to India in the early 1990s. In terms of the medical ecosystem, what has changed in India since then? The biggest change is exceptional tertiary care, which even puts the rest of the world to shame. Many countries in the world would be surprised to see the kind of expertise that doctors have here. The second big change is highvolume, high-quality medical care, which is again startling. And what has failed to change? Lack of quality primary care is the biggest concern. With money and energy spent in tertiary medical care, it requires strong political intervention to create infrastructure for primary healthcare. You need to give incentives to young doctors and nurses to work in the primary healthcare system. The pressure that doctors work under has also not changed. Any other medical trend that you have noticed in India? The breakdown of the doctor-patient relationship is disturbing. There have been reports where doctors have been abused and assaulted. It is happening in China as well. There's an unrealistic expectation from medicines and doctors. But there are other issues as well. We are overpromising in terms of offering treatment. Then there are issues about patients taking loans to meet medical expenses. There have been reports of people selling assets and getting bankrupt. These are awful decisions that people have to make. Can drug price control make healthcare more affordable? The government in India has been doing something to bring price control in drug treatment. That's the issue right across the world where drugs are hugely overpriced. Drug companies, for their part, say that they have to recover research and development costs. Since the markup is huge, we need to incentivise drug companies to behave in a different way. The problem of drug pricing is more apparent in India because people are paying themselves.",https://t.co/NgL5ADnHtK,others

Ketogenic Diet and Insulin Resistance,"This post may be sponsored or contain affiliate links. All opinions remain our own.(Full disclosure)Ketogenic diets around the world have been known to be extremely effective in helping improve health and lose weight fast.The diet takes into account and addresses the underlying causes of your weight gain, which could include things such as hormonal imbalances.With the ketogenic diet, you are forcing the body to go into ketosis by restricting your net carb intake to under 50 grams a day.With the number of restricted carbs, your body needs to reset its way of getting the fuel that it needs.See how a diet high in healthy fats can help improve insulin resistance by changing the bodies preferred fuel source from glucose to ketones.What is Insulin and Insulin ResistanceInsulin is a fat storing hormone formed by the pancreas that enables your body to manage glucose and sugars from carbs within the food.It prevents blood sugar levels from hyperglycemia or reaching too high or hyperglycemia which is too low.Insulin resistance has many symptoms including sugar cravings, weight gain, high blood pressure, high cholesterol.(1)Insulin resistance is also linked to type 2 diabetes. Therefore, cutting out or reducing sugar in your meal planning will help prevent becoming diabetic.The worrying thing about insulin resistance is symptoms take a long time to appear.When symptoms surface such as weight gain, multiple other problems may creep up.LowCarbAlphaHow does a ketogenic diet improve insulin resistance?Why You Gain WeightInsulin in your body helps to regulate your blood sugar levels. Blood sugar also referred to as glucose is the primary fuel in the body for energy and brain function.When blood sugar rises, the insulin your pancreas releases move the glucose into your bloodstream. If there is glucose in your system, your body will burn it first for fuel.If your body is already filled with higher glucose levels, more cannot be broken down for fuel.So because of this, your body stores these excess levels as fat.Having high levels of insulin can lead to developing type 2 diabetes.Some quick diabetes facts are it affects 25.8 million people or 8.3% of the U.S. population with 7 million people undiagnosed.(2)(3)Keto in Five 120 Low Carb RecipesWhat Makes Insulin Levels Rise?The short answer to this question is higher levels of carbohydrate consumption.Carbohydrates are used by the body and broken down in your gut. This then turns them into blood sugar.Since complex or simple carb both convert into blood sugar, it doesn't really matter the type you eat.When you consume excess sugar with your meals, your body releases more insulin.So essentially if you eat high levels of carbs, the body must release a ton of insulin to compensate for this.Modifying your nutrition and eating healthy high fat diet can help fix the problem by limiting the number of sugars you consume.With the ketogenic diet plan, you limit your carb consumption to help decrease the amount of insulin your body needs.With a lack of carbohydrates for energy, your body will start to burn stored fat levels and ultimately ketones for fuel, helping you to lose weight in the process. Ketogenic Diet PlanWhen starting a ketogenic diet nutrition plan, you will want to start by limiting the number of net carbs you eat to under 50 grams a day to reach ketosis.In doing this, it's a good idea to choose low carb healthier carbs over the starchier and sugar-filled carbs.Vegetables and keto-friendly fruits are great choices.Green leafy and bitter low-glycemic vegetables are healthful, wholesome sources of carbs.In addition to the carb reduction, you may want to decrease the amount of protein you consume as well. It will depend on how well you can adjust to a high-fat diet.Many people often increase protein intake and end up making it more of an Atkins or typical low carb diet. Eating fatty foods helps combat this issue.Eating darker meats that contain more fish oil is a great beginning part. These include salmon, lean beef, and lamb.Once you've made a few lifestyle choices and changes you will be amazed just how fast the pounds start to fall off with a ketogenic diet weight loss plan.Dinner In Five 30 Low Carb DinnersHow to Know If You Have Insulin Resistance?See you're GP or health-care professional, and they can take blood tests, a detailed history, and performing a physical examination to see if you have insulin resistance.Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels are normally enough to establish whether you are pre-diabetic, have diabetes or insulin resistance.If you find out you have symptoms, then you can manage it primarily with more exercise, better low sugar diet plan, nutrition, and other lifestyle changes.Using a Ketogenic Diet to Improve Insulin ResistanceInsulin resistance is linked to fatty liver and colorectal cancer, carb dependence, periodontal disease, high blood sugar, and blood pressure.(4)(5)The more carbs you eat, the more it will release insulin. Restricting net carbs to 20g-50g by essentially eating fatty foods will help improve insulin levels.It will also help raise good cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease by stabilizing blood sugar whereas a high carb diet will increase risk.(6)Studies show a ketogenic diet can assist with raising good cholesterol (HDL-C) and aid weight loss.Dessert In Five 30 Low Carb DessertsComparing keto to a low-fat weight loss diet, a very low-carbohydrate diet did not lower LDL-C but prevents the decline in HDL-C.It also results in improved insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese people.(7)Anyone can benefit from lowering sugar intake and increasing healthy foods. If you have symptoms of insulin resistance or concerned about your blood sugar, don't delay and make an appointment with your doctor.If you have any questions regarding low carb or keto dieting, please leave comments below.",https://t.co/iC6dfwNTtx,others
"House Lawmakers Grill Drugmakers, PBMs on Insulin Cost","Members of the US House of Representatives on Wednesday expressed clear disbelief and growing frustration with the explanations for high insulin prices charged by drugmakers and pharmaceutical middlemen. At a hearing held by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD) challenged arguments presented by pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs), who said secrecy in negotiations ultimately helps lower drug prices for consumers. More transparency about the flow of money in the pharmaceutical supply chain thus would result in higher drug prices for consumers, according to witnesses from the PBMs. ""I don't buy it. I'm not buying it. I think a system has been built that allows for gaming to go on,"" Sarbanes told the hearing's six witnesses, who were executives representing drugmakers and PBMs. ""The system is working for both of you at the expense of the patient."" About 7.4 million people in the United States take insulin, according to a report by the American Diabetes Association. Lawmakers frequently hear stories from their constituents about what happens when people face high insulin costs, with some not paying other bills in order to buy the drug, said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), chair of the Oversight and Investigations panel of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Other patients report having to ration doses or skip insulin altogether, she said. ""It is simply unacceptable that anyone in this country cannot access the drug their very lives depend on,"" DeGette said. ""All because the price of this drug — a drug that is nearly 100 years old — has gotten out of control."" Although the estimated manufacturing cost of most forms of insulins ranges from $2.28 to $6.34 per vial, consumers may pay more than $400 per month for the drug, the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a memo for the Wednesday hearing held by DeGette's subcommittee. The Oversight and Investigations subcommittee also heard from diabetes experts last week about the struggles of patients to afford insulin, a drug first brought to the US market in 1923. Insulin has been modified over the years into forms that are more convenient for patients to use, such as the long-acting glargine (Lantus SoloStar, Sanofi). Yet lawmakers on Wednesday noted even these more advanced products have been on the market for many years, making the continual price increases a surprise. Medicare has reported, for example, that its Part D plans saw a 9.8% increase in annual growth rate for average spending per dose of Lantus Solostar between 2013 and 2017. The high cost of insulin is helping erode consumers' faith in the free market approach to pharmaceutical pricing, said House Energy and Commerce Chair Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ). Although he still favors this method, many of his constituents do not, Pallone said. ""What they tell me is 'Just set the price.' They'll literally say to me, 'You in Congress or some government agency should just set the price and that's it,'"" Pallone said at the hearing. ""They just don't believe in the competitive model anymore."" The comment from Pallone was striking, given the location of his district on the edge of the historical American cradle of the pharmaceutical industry. Pallone's New Brunswick, New Jersey, district office is a few blocks from Johnson &amp; Johnson's headquarters. It's also within about 40 miles of major offices of Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Novartis. And within about 20 miles of Pallone's New Brunswick office are the US headquarters of two insulin makers whose executives attended the Wednesday hearing: Novo Nordisk, with US operations based in Plainsboro, New Jersey, and Sanofi, in Bridgewater. While addressing questions from Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA), Kathleen W. Tregoning, Sanofi's executive vice president of external affairs noted her company on Wednesday had unveiled an expansion of its insulin savings program. Launched a year ago, Sanofi's program initially allowed customers who pay cash to pay the set prices of $99 for one 10-mL vial or $149 for a box of pens. The program now will allow them to purchase as much as 10 boxes of pens and/or 10-mL vials for $99 per month, Sanofi said in a statement. Kennedy questioned what he seemed to see as convenient timing of this expansion, observing to Tregoning that the change had been ""announced today when you are in front of Congress."" Like many members of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, Kennedy expressed frustration about the seemingly endless loop of PBMs blaming insulin makers for high costs and the pharmaceutical companies, in turn, blaming the benefit managers. ""If you are in my position, what do we do to try to make sure that the patients in this country get access to life-saving medication?"" for which initial rights were sold for about $1, Kennedy said, referring to the price those who discovered insulin charged the University of Toronto for the patent. Separately, Senate Finance Chair Charles E. Grassley (R-IA) said in a statement Wednesday that Sanofi's move, and a similar announcement from Cigna last week, raise many questions. ""Why was Sanofi charging so much more before this announcement? What took them so long to offer the price reduction?"" Grassley said. ""It shouldn't take months of bad press, persistent public outcry, and increasing congressional scrutiny to get a company to charge a fair price. That's not how a functioning marketplace works."" ""Prescription drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers should take very seriously their responsibility to patients and taxpayers,"" Grassley added. ""Right now, they're not. And that's a status quo that's not going to last."" Grassley and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, are in the midst of their own investigation of insulin prices. Grassley and Wyden on Wednesday also said they had asked the Inspector General of Health and Human Services (HHS) for an analysis of PBM's business practices, specifically regarding certain pricing in Medicaid. In the House, DeGette, as chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, and Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, the panel's ranking Republican, are spearheading their chamber's examination of high insulin prices and conducting their own investigation. Smoke-and-Mirrors System After DeGette and colleagues grilled representatives of drugmakers and PBMs for several hours on Wednesday, she said she may call them back in June or September to update the subcommittee on their progress on their efforts to lower insulin costs. ""This is not optional and it is going to happen,"" DeGette told the witnesses. In her view, a ""smoke-and-mirrors"" system is triggering continual increases in the list prices for insulin, so that PBMs can then negotiate to somehow bring the price back down. She cited as an example insulin lispro (Humalog, Eli Lilly), a drug used by her daughter, Francesca, who has type 1 diabetes. The price has risen from about $35 a vial in 2001 to $275, DeGette said. ""The generic Humalog that Lilly has come up with, good news, it's only $137 a bottle. So it's still way beyond where it was in 2001,"" DeGette said. Appearing as witnesses at the hearing, representatives of Cigna's Express Scripts, UnitedHealth's Optum, and CVS maintained that drugmakers are responsible for setting high list prices. Thomas M. Moriarty, executive vice president, chief policy and external affairs officer for CVS, said list prices for insulin have increased nearly 50% in the last 3 years alone. ""Over the last 10 years, the list price of one product, Lantus, rose by 184%,"" Moriarty said. ""The primary challenge we face is that unlike most other therapeutic classes, until recently, there have been no generic alternatives available."" Drugmakers have maintained that PBMs actually encourage them to raise list prices, putting their firms at risk of losing business if they dropped the cost of their insulin. They also said the list prices may provide a deceptive view of their potential profit from medicines, with rebate money flowing to insurers and PBMs. In written testimony, Michael B. Mason, Lilly's senior vice president for Connected Care and Insulins, included a chart that showed Lilly's net price for its most widely used insulin product, Humalog U100, dropping even as its list price spiked. The average list price rose from $391 in 2014 to $594 in 2018, a gain of more than 50%, according to Lilly's chart. Yet, the average net price that Lilly realized from these sales slipped from $147 in 2014 to $135 in 2018, a decline of about 8.2%. In addition, Humalog ""is essentially free to Medicaid programs,"" as Lilly pays a rebate of about 100%, Mason said, noting the expansion of the health program as a result of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The number of people enrolled in Medicaid increased from 54.5 million in 2010 to 73.4 million in 2017. ""Providing insulin to this population at little or no cost is a significant step towards ensuring affordable access for those in need,"" Mason said. Lawmakers have introduced a number of bills intended to foster greater transparency about drug prices and speed generic competition for medicines. It's unclear how much of this proposed legislation will be enacted, with drugmakers in opposition to some proposed changes. PBMs face perhaps a more immediate commercial threat from an HHS proposal. In January, HHS Secretary Alex Azar proposed an overhaul of how PBMs get paid for Medicare and Medicaid transactions. Azar said he intends to address what he calls a ""perverse incentive"" with rebates, in that PBMs stand to profit more if pharmaceutical companies set higher list prices. Azar is seeking to amend federal rules, originally meant to prevent patient harm from industry kickbacks, to reroute the flow of discounts. He's seeking to have these savings on drugs flow more directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. HHS is seeking to create new fixed fee services arrangements between drugmakers and PBMs. The proposal has split industry groups, with the trade group for drugmakers, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), supporting the move and the trade group for PBMs, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), criticizing it. In their testimony during the Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, PBMs noted that HHS's own proposed rule includes analyses that suggest it would raise premiums for consumers. The actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that Part D premiums will increase by as much as 25% and federal spending will increase by $196 billion over 10 years, said Amy Bricker, RPh, senior vice president of the supply chain of Express Scripts in her testimony. Still, lawmakers appeared skeptical about how well the rebate system benefits consumers. At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) suggested simply dropping the rebates and moving to a system in which PBMs would get a flat fee for serving as go-betweens. He questioned what justifies cases where PBMs base their fees on list prices for medicines. ""It doesn't cost your company any more to process a $4 drug than it does a $40,000 drug,"" Griffith said. ""Wouldn't it make more sense just to have a flat fee for doing what y'all do?"" Rep. Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter (R-GA) said concerns about the business practices of PBMs and drugmakers have sparked rare unity among Democrats and Republicans in Congress. ""What you've witnessed here today is bipartisanship,"" Carter, who owns community pharmacies, told the witnesses. He predicted that HHS would prevail in its efforts to overhaul the drug rebate system, particularly efforts to apply discounts at the point of sale. ""That's going to happen. We're going to make sure that happens,"" Carter said. ""That's going to bring more transparency to the system and we're not going to stop there.""

Insulin Distress,"Abstract Diabetes distress (DD) is a commonly encountered adjustment disorder among persons living with diabetes. This article discusses insulindistress, a subtype of DD, which has distinct characteristics. Insulin distress can be defined as an emotional response to a suggestionto use insulin; characterized by extreme apprehension, discomfort, dejection, or denial; due to a perceived inability to cope with therequirements of insulin therapy. We describe the etiopathogenesis, clinical features and management of insulin distress. They highlight the clinicalchallenges that insulin distress poses in some persons. Pragmatic suggestions are shared regarding the addressing of insulin distress before orin parallel with insulin prescription. Keywords Clinical inertia, insulin, insulin initiation, insulinintensification, psychosocial aspects Disclosure Sanjay Kalra and Yatan Pal Singh Balharahave nothing to declare in relation to this article.

While earlier authors defined DD as a set of unique, often hidden emotional burdens and worries that are part of the spectrum of patient experience when managing a severe, demanding chronic disease like diabetes,1 recent conceptualization views it as an emotional response characterized by extreme apprehension, discomfort or dejection, due to a perceived inability to cope with the challenges and demands of living with diabetes.2DD can be measured using validated scales, including the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS).3 Specific versions of DDS are available for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as parents of teens and partners of adults with type 1 diabetes. These scales help one assess the source of DD. The DDS documents four dimensions of distress. These are: emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress, and physician distress.4 The dimensions of DD in type 1 include powerlessness, management distress, hypoglycemia distress, negative social perceptions, eating distress, physician distress, and friends/family distress.5 Distress and insulin inertia Diabetes care providers are well aware of the barriers that prevent timely insulin initiation and intensification.6 The bridges that can overcome these barriers are also listed and classified in detail.7 The impact of clinical inertia on long-term outcomes is also well known, as are the advantages of timely insulin initiation and intensification.8 At times, however, the potential long-term advantages of insulin may be nullified by short-term diabetes ""distress."" Clinically evident distress in the patient may discourage diabetes care providers from discussing and prescribing biomedically apt therapeutic interventions. Insulin as a cause of diabetes distress One significant contributor to DD is insulin. Even the mere suggestion to initiate insulin is associated with a wide array of emotions among most people. These emotional responses range from innocuous apprehension to significant discomfort and even feelings of dejection, and are caused by a ""perceived inability"" to cope with the ""challenges and demands"" of using insulin. Also, it is not uncommon that these emotions are driven by underlying assumptions that are based on myths, rather than facts. However, more importantly, these emotions are real, and cannot be ignored. We therefore suggest that there is a need to address insulin distress as a separate entity.Insulin distress Insulin distress can be defined as an emotional response to the suggestion to use insulin, characterized by extreme apprehension, discomfort, dejection, or denial, due to a perceived inability to cope with the requirements of insulin therapy.Insulin distress is a construct based upon the biopsychosocial health model. Persons with diabetes may fear insulin for a variety of reasons. These concerns are perpetuated by a self-sustaining system of hearsay. The availability of easy communication tools, provided by modern technology, have facilitated the spread of such ""e-hearsay"".9 Etiopathogenesis The etiology of insulin distress may be biomedical, e.g., limited visual, tactile or motor dexterity. It may also be psychosocial in origin, such as fear of social ostracization or lack of financial support.10,11 While insulin distress is usually encountered before or during insulin initiation, it may occur at any time in the course of living with diabetes. Periods of poor glycemic control, poor symptom relief, suggestions for insulin intensification or change in preparation/delivery device may precipitate insulin distress. Distress may also occur in persons who are susceptible to negative reinforcement from friends, relatives, or practitioners of alternative medicine.Clinical course Insulin distress can present with a varied temporal profile and severity. While some persons may have ""acute"" or short-term distress, which resolves with counseling, others may experience subacute or chronic distress, which is refractory to diabetes education interventions. It is not uncommon to encounter ""relapses"" of insulin distress, precipitated by ill-informed relatives and friends, who counsel against insulin therapy.Insulin and diabetes distress—distinct entitiesWhile insulin distress is a part of DD, it is distinct and unique enough to warrant specific consideration. Insulin distress is spread over all domains of DD, as assessed by DDS type 1. Talk about insulin therapy may initially create a sense of powerlessness, and contribute to management distress. Concerns about hypoglycemia, negative social perceptions and restriction may be heightened with insulin use. Insulin conversations with physicians and friends/family may also lead to distress due to unfounded concern. While DD can accompany the lifelong journey of diabetes, insulin distress is usually episodic. Diabetes distress runs a chronic course, with peaks and troughs. On the other hand, insulin distress may be acute, subacute or chronic; monophasic or recurrent. Either may be precipitated by internal events (onset or worsening of complications), by changes in management strategy (frequency and intensity of diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions) or by psychosocial factors (suboptimal social or financial environment). Both of these types of distress respond to non-pharmacological measures, including strengthening of coping skills. While DD requires a generalized approach to management, insulin distress requires more specific and focused interventions.Disorders of adjustment The International Classification of Disease (ICD 10) by the World Health Organization (WHO) states that adjustment disorders are:""states of subjective distress and emotional disturbance, usually interfering with social functioning and performance, and arising in the period of adaptation to a significant life change or to the consequences of a stressful life event (including the presence or possibility of serious physical illness) […] Individual predisposition or vulnerability plays a greater role in the risk of occurrence and the shaping of the manifestations of adjustment disorders […] but it is nevertheless assumed that the condition would not have arisen without the stressor. The manifestations vary, and include depressed mood, anxiety, worry (or a mixture of these), a feeling of inability to cope, plan ahead, or continue in the present situation, and some degree of disability in the performance of daily routine"".12 This clinical picture suggests that insulin distress seems to meet the criteria of an adjustment disorder as specified in ICD 10.12The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) describes adjustment disorder as ""the presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s)."" In addition to exposure to one or more stressors, other DSM-5 criteria for adjustment disorder must be present:""The distress is out of proportion with expected reactions to the stressor and/or symptoms must be clinically significant leading to marked distress and impairment in functioning. The distress and impairment should be related to the stressor and are not an escalation of existing mental health disorders. Once the stressor is removed or the person has begun to adjust and cope, the symptoms must subside within six months"". These characteristics also suggest that insulin distress is a disorder of adjustment. However, six months may be an inappropriately long timeframe for assessing the adequacy of adjustment and coping with insulin.13 ManagementThe management of insulin distress takes significant cues from the management of DD.2 It is based upon four cardinal principles, namely, strengthening of self-care skills, optimization of coping skills, minimizing change-related discomfort, and utilization of external support. The umbrella term ""coping therapy"" can be used to encompass these principles. Insulin distress needs to be managed by addressing patient-related, physician-related and drug-related factors.7 Strengthening communication and coping skills, along with diabetes/insulin literacy, among all stakeholders, is a prerequisite to creating a sense of comfort with insulin. The clinical challenge, however, is in deciding whether to address insulin distress before prescribing insulin, or to postpone insulin initiation until distress is resolved (Figure 1).This planning is important, as it will set the stage for further diabetes care, and influence long-term outcomes. An in-depth understanding of both psychology and diabetology is needed to arrive at an appropriate decision. Take-home messages Keeping the aforementioned facts in mind, we suggest the following pragmatic and practical approach to this clinical situation:A thorough biomedical and psychosocial evaluation should precede and accompany discussion regarding insulin in persons with type 2 diabetes.Diabetes care providers must be aware of insulin distress, its etiology, clinical features, and management.Potential biomedical and psychosocial factors, which may limit insulin acceptance and adherence, must be explored and addressed. The need for insulin, and urgency of insulin prescription, should be balanced with the severity of insulin distress (see Figure 1B).In persons with life-threatening, organ-threatening, or limb-threatening illness for which insulin therapy is needed, insulin distress mitigation strategies should accompany insulin prescription.In persons with low or insignificant insulin distress, insulin therapy should be initiated as per clinical indications. Coping skills should be strengthened in parallel.In persons with significant insulin distress and no immediate threat to health, insulin distress should be addressed prior to starting insulin. Addressing of insulin distress may take one or more clinical interventions.A triage system, as proposed in Figure 1, may help prioritize between insulin initiation and insulin distress mitigation. Comfort level with insulin should be assessed and addressed if necessary, at every clinical encounter in persons using insulin.",https://t.co/Gf2T8Lpcs3,others
Developing Nanotech for Better Insulin Therapy,"Bob Geho refers to himself as a ""liver evangelist"" when it comes to improving diabetes care. That's because he's on a holy mission to get insulin to be better absorbed in the bodies of PWDs (people with diabetes), using nanotechnology targetting that organ.The 50-year-old from Cleveland, OH, also happens to live with type 1 himself, diagnosed during college in the early 90s. That was a life-changing moment that shifted not only how he thought about his own health, but also set him on a career path in medical science that his father had paved before him.Today, he is CEO of Cleveland-based startup Diasome Pharmaceuticals, developing nanotechnology known as HDV (short for Hepatocyte Directed Vesicles), that would be injected as an insulin add-on or swallowed as a pill. It would attach to insulin, causing the medication to be better absorbed into the liver's metabolic cells (rather than the muscles or fat) before being released back into the bloodstream.In short, this liver-targeted compound could be a game-changer for how insulin works -- because while the medication obviously saves lives, getting the dosing right is a huge challenge, fraught with guess-work and risks. It is well-known that injected insulin doesn't work fast enough in the body, so Diasome's product could be a revolutionary fix. ""The revolution that has to happen, and that I view us as vanguard of, is a need for this kind of (more precise and predictable) insulin therapy,"" Geho says. ""It's not generally well understood either in the pharmaceutical industry or in routine clinical practice why insulin doesn't work in the liver like it should, and we think this would dramatically change the day-to-day of insulin therapy. We want to turn this whole thing upside-down.""Share on PinterestImage created by DiabetesMine Father and Son Tackle Diabetes ResearchGeho never dreamed he would follow in the footsteps of his famous medical researcher father, Dr. W. Blair Geho. His dad entered medical school in the early 60s and was taken under the wing of the great pharmacologist Dr. Earl Sutherland Jr., who won a Nobel prize in 1971 for his work on protein chemistry and was part of the team that identified ""the mystery protein of glucagon"" in the 70s.W. Blair Geho, MDStudying under Sutherland, the elder Geho learned the foundation of knowledge that he'd go on to use in developing liver-specific insulin years later. Geho joined Procter &amp; Gamble in the 60s and helped build the company's Research Division, which his son says gave him more insight into the body's chemical process than those working directly in Pharma because of P&amp;G's research on Crest toothpaste, that delved into bone metabolism. While at P&amp;G, Blair Geho also led the development of Didronel, the first bisphosphonate drug approved for human use, and Osteoscan, the first bone imaging agent.Blair Geho didn't have any personal connection to diabetes, other than family members with type 2, but his research led him down the path of liver-specific insulin. In the early 90s, he would go on to found the tech-startup SDG Inc. in Cleveland as a way to continue his work developing techniques to improve insulin delivery in diabetics.Right around that time in the early 90s, his son Bob was studying music and planning to become an orchestra conductor (following graduate business school, which he went into as a ""fallback"" in case music didn't materialize). But a routine physical led to a type 1 diagnosis, and the first call after seeing his own doctor was to his father. From that point on, diabetes became his world -- personally and professionally. It's now been 26 years.""My father was just starting SDG and continuing his odyssey of creating an insulin therapy device, so I went there and got my feet wet... the rest, as they say, is history,"" Geho says. ""I jumped ship from the music world and got very intrigued by (my father's) mindset and that kind of diabetes research.""The two have been on a joint path ever since, at the helm of several startups all aiming at the same goal: to get this HDV oral and injection insulin therapy through the research phases and onto the market. The 1994-created SDG holding tech company is now in its 25th year, and the father-son team also jointly founded Diasome Pharmaceuticals, now in its 15th year. After a down-period in which they've been quietly working on the science as well as funding, Bob Geho stepped back in as CEO and Director of Diasome a few years ago and his father now serves as Chief Science Officer.Their mission hasn't changed, and Geho tells us they're getting closer than ever before. The Concept Behind Diasome Really, the concept of HDV tech (Hepatocyte Directed Vesicles) is pretty simple to understand: making insulin work in your body the way it should, as it does in those without diabetes.As Geho puts it: ""Why can we inject twice as much insulin as a healthy, non-diabetic, but still have high blood glucose levels? Because insulin doesn't work the way it should in the body.""This illustrates the need for therapy beyond just getting the insulin into our bodies, he says.In those without diabetes, food triggers insulin from the pancreas but it first goes into the liver, where about 65% of the glucose is stored. But for us PWDs, the subcutaneous insulin we take is used first by fat and muscle cells and not the liver. So when we're taking insulin at the time of a meal, instead of the liver storing as much as two-thirds of the glucose we eat, almost all of it goes through the liver and into the blood. Only the hepatocytes in the liver can both store and then release the glucose, but that's not what happens with the insulin we're using.Think of it like the ""streetlight effect"" -- where someone is standing under a street light at night looking for their keys or a dropped coin, blocks away from where they actually dropped it; someone asks why they're not searching closer to where it was dropped, and the searcher responds: ""Better light here."" That is the equivalent of what's happening with HDV and insulin, Geho says; the Liver is the darkness and insulin just doesn't get there to work effectively. Rather, it's just going to where the light is and PWDs are left hoping it works.Geho points to recent outcomes data from the Jaeb Center and T1D Exchange showing bleak results on how few people with diabetes are actually meeting their A1C or outcomes goals. With HDV, they can help shine a little more light into those dark areas and help the insulin work better, he says.While their HDV tech is undergoing clinical trials, the vision for a product prototype could involve a few different options:Diasome could market HDV for patients to add into the vial or pen they are using in increments of 20 nanometers. The HDV nanoparticles would attach to the insulin and allow a certain portion of it, when injected into the body, to go into the PWD's liver. Nothing about the insulin structure would change, so it's simply an add-on for the life-sustaining meds we already use each day. That HDV solution could be sold right in the package with existing insulin products, for patients to add to their pens, vials or pump cartridges when ready. But it's more likely to be sold as a separate product, since insulin developers may not be keen to coupling it with their products.Or if partnerships did materialize with insulin manufacturers Lilly, Novo and Sanofi, there could be a way to add the HDV into those insulin products during the production process, as an ingredient making their insulins more effective.Diasome is also developing an oral capsule form, which contains five units of the HDV insulin molecules.""It's almost an alarmingly simple idea,"" Geho says. ""No one else in the insulin world is looking at a liver-targeted meal-time insulin therapy, and that leaves Diasome out in front -- possibly on its own."" A Big Insulin Oversight? As a type 1 himself, Geho is grateful for the insulins we have today, but certainly not content. ""Now, I love being able to inject 15 minutes before a meal, rather than longer times before that. I appreciate that and love what these companies are giving us to do that. But it's a terrible product from a day-to-day aspect. You really couldn't design a worse product. That's the reason we exist, to change that and develop a tech that allows our insulin to understand glucose metabolism.""Geho even says that new, faster injectable insulins -- including Novo's faster-acting Fiasp -- face the same challenge because they won't solve the issue of going into the liver. Inhaled insulin like Afrezza is a bit of a different animal, because it goes into the lungs rather than the liver, he says.But he can't quite understand why this liver pathway has been all but ignored to date. ""At a certain level, people should be outraged because the insulin companies aren't telling us this story,"" Geho says. ""Every high school student learns that the liver stores glucose, but for some reason the Pharma insulin-makers don't seem to realize that. It's puzzling.""While Pharma giants Lilly and Novo have abandoned their own liver-targeted insulin therapies, there continues to be quite a bit of interest in the area of research, he says. JDRF Support of Insulin and Liver StudiesSo why hasn't Diasome moved along faster in the past five years? Geho points out that there has been quite a bit of change and ""expanded thinking"" in the insulin world. This has been helped along by JDRF's T1DFund, founded in 2015 to narrow the gap between scientific advancements and commercial solutions. In 2017, that investment fund took on Diasome's research as one of its projects, which has kickstarted their clinical studies in recent years. Part of that also involves looking Beyond A1C in clinical research, so that other outcomes such as reduced hypoglycemia and Time In Range (TIR) will also be examined as they develop this HDV insulin therapy.""We are trying to be as forward-thinking as possible,"" Geho tells us.To date, Diasome has completed three human clinical studies of its HDV nanotech in PWDs with type 1:Its Phase 2 ""Good to Great"" double-blinded, multi-center study that compared injected HDV added to rapid acting insulin (lispro) versus lispro alone in 42 patients with baseline A1C levels between 6.9% and 7.9% over six weeks of dosing.Its Phase 2 ""Insulin Pump"" double-blinded crossover study that compared injected HDV added to lispro versus lispro alone in seven subjects on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion over three weeks.Its Phase 2b ""InSulin Liver Effect"" (ISLE-1) double-blinded, multi-center study that included 176 patients and compared injected HDV added to lispro versus lispro alone over six months of dosing.Going forward, more research is on tap and already underway:The first type 1 PWD has been enrolled in a Phase 2 clinical trial known as ""OPTI-1 study,"" which looks at dosing guidance for HDV injections. It's a six-month study started in March 2019, and is expected to enroll 60 people. Here is a news release on that study.If everything goes as planned, Diasome expects to work with FDA in 2019 to finalize Phase 3 clinical trial protocols, and those could begin in early 2020. If so, he hopes to have HDV additives to market by 2022.The science and concept are very intriguing, as well as the mission: to make every unit of insulin work better with the body's normal metabolic system -- making all insulins more effective and much safer. It sure will be interesting to watch Diasome and this HDV therapy move forward!Oh, and does Geho still have any music in his life?He laughs, and tells us all four of his kids play piano but for the most part music is now a strictly personal way to help clear his head when needed. The main orchestra he's conducting these days is all about insulin therapy, and the hope is that it turns out to be for the Diabetes Community what Mozart was to the music world.",https://t.co/CW0LghzZ51,others
Dr Jason Fung: Therapeutic Fasting and Weight Loss,"Dr Jason Fung is a Canadian nephrologist. Seeing many diabetic patients with kidney complications, he has taken special interest in obesity and diabetes. He has pioneered the use of therapeutic fasting regimens for weight loss and type 2 diabetes control, with great success, at his Intensive Dietary Management clinic in Toronto. This talk was given at the Public Health Collaboration conference 2017 in Manchester.The current international consensus is that a caloric deficit (weight gain = calories in – calories out) is required to achieve weight loss, and that this is achieved by eating less and exercising more. But when looking at the scientific literature, it is clear that this approach is not very well evidenced at all. For example, the TODAY Study found that over 60 months, metformin plus lifestyle changes (in the form of the eat less, exercise more approach) was no more effective for weight loss than metformin alone, with neither group losing any weight. In fact, according to the UK General Practice Database 2004-2014, the probability of an obese person achieving a normal weight by following 'eat less, exercise more' advice is 0.6%. In addition, 80% of people managing a 10% reduction in weight will regain this weight within a year. This effectively means that the vast majority of calorie restriction or 'eat less, exercise more' strategies are doomed to fail.So why does the current model not work? The main reason for the failure of calorie restriction is that the body, as a survival mechanism, lowers its basal metabolic rate (BMR) when calorie intake is reduced. Therefore, when the body is taking in less calories, it's also burning less too. This leads to reduced energy levels, increased hunger (which involves changes to satiety hormones) and trouble staying warm. The worst part of this is, when the BMR falls enough to match caloric intake, weight loss stalls or even reverses. We have actually known this for around a century, with the findings being reiterated fairly often since. In addition, exercise has also proven an ineffective tool in preventing and reversing weight gain in the long term. The potential reasons for this are increased hunger following exercise and compensation for increased exercise with longer periods of rest. Thus, neither manipulation of calorie intake, nor the amount of exercise, is managing to achieve weight loss.The key to losing weight is breaking into the body's fat stores for energy, and the main hormone that controls this is insulin. Eating food, particularly carbohydrates, throughout the day maintains raised levels of insulin, even if the overall calorie intake is reduced. This instructs the body to switch off lipolysis (fat burning) whilst activating lipogenesis (fat creation), resulting in fat gain. On the other hand, abstaining from caloric intake altogether, for an extended period of time, lowers insulin levels and allows lipolysis to be switched back on, thus, the body is permitted to break into its fat stores for energy. This practice is called intermittent fasting and has physiological effects distinct from those of calorie restriction. During periods of fasting, not only is BMR maintained via increased noradrenaline levels, but there is also no net increase in hunger, measured via ghrelin levels. Furthermore, intermittent fasting also preserves lean body mass, and so is said to be muscle-sparing.People cannot just make a decision to burn more fat calories, or to feel less hungry. These are physiological issues and must be addressed via physiology. It is time to stop scolding people for lack of willpower, and to start showing them how to lose weight in a healthy fashion, without torturing themselves.",https://t.co/jHEyJ1iBH5,others
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion versus multiple daily injection regimens in children and young people at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: pra... - PubMed - NCBI,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost utility of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens during the first year following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young people.DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre, open label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.SETTING: 15 paediatric National Health Service (NHS) diabetes services in England and Wales. The study opened to recruitment in May 2011 and closed in January 2017.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged between 7 months and 15 years, with a new diagnosis of type 1 diabetes were eligible to participate. Patients who had a sibling with the disease, and those who took drug treatments or had additional diagnoses that could have affected glycaemic control were ineligible.INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised, stratified by age and treating centre, to start treatment with CSII or MDI within 14 days of diagnosis. Starting doses of aspart (CSII and MDI) and glargine or detemir (MDI) were calculated according to weight and age, and titrated according to blood glucose measurements and according to local clinical practice.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was glycaemic control (as measured by glycated haemoglobin; HbA1c) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were percentage of patients in each treatment arm with HbA1c within the national target range, incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, change in height and body mass index (as measured by standard deviation scores), insulin requirements (units/kg/day), partial remission rate (insulin dose adjusted HbA1c &lt;9), paediatric quality of life inventory score, and cost utility based on the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from an NHS costing perspective.RESULTS: 294 participants were randomised and 293 included in intention to treat analyses (CSI, n=144; MDI, n=149). At 12 months, mean HbA1c was comparable with clinically unimportant differences between CSII and MDI participants (60.9 mmol/mol v 58.5 mmol/mol, mean difference 2.4 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval -0.4 to 5.3), P=0.09). Achievement of HbA1c lower than 58 mmol/mol was low among the two groups (66/143 (46%) CSII participants v 78/142 (55%) MDI participants; relative risk 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.06)). Incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were low in both groups. Fifty four non-serious and 14 serious adverse events were reported during CSII treatment, and 17 non-serious and eight serious adverse events during MDI treatment. Parents (but not children) reported superior PedsQL scores for those patients treated with CSII compared to those treated with MDI. CSII was more expensive than MDI by £1863 (€2179; $2474; 95% confidence interval £1620 to £2137) per patient, with no additional QALY gains (difference -0.006 (95% confidence interval -0.031 to 0.018)).CONCLUSION: During the first year following type 1 diabetes diagnosis, no clinical benefit of CSII over MDI was identified in children and young people in the UK setting, and treatment with either regimen was suboptimal in achieving HbA1c thresholds. CSII was not cost effective.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN29255275; European Clinical Trials Database 2010-023792-25.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

"Boy with type 1 diabetes goes 24 months without insulin on Paleolithic ketogenic diet, but is this a honeymoon period?","Last year, we reported on a study in which a nine-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes was able to come off insulin injections for 19 months by following a Paleolithic ketogenic diet.Before beginning the diet – a modified version of the ketogenic diet, which consisted only of animal meat, fat, offal and eggs with a fat:protein ratio of 2:1 – the boy had been on insulin therapy for six weeks, alongside a high-carbohydrate diet.Some members of the diabetes community attributed the success of the diet to the honeymoon period, which is when people with type 1 diabetes can still produce some insulin following their diagnosis.Are these findings attributable to a honeymoon period?Not according to Hungarian physician Dr. Csaba Tóth.""This should by no means be regarded as a honeymoon period"", Dr. Tóth, the medical leader of Paleomedicina Hungary, told Diabetes.co.uk""Besides this method, we are not aware of any clinical data from literature indicating an increase in C-peptide following [type 1] diagnosis onset while being safe and without side effects.""Typically, C-peptide tends to zero already at one year after diagnosis onset on the standard diabetes diet. The present case is not the only one in our practice. We are following others and experiencing the same.""Furthermore, Dr. Tóth believes that adopting the diet could lead to autoimmune changes within type 1 diabetes.""It seems that if one strictly adheres to the diet, the autoimmune process may halt. From ex vivo human studies four routes are known to recover pancreatic beta cells. Thus it seems possible to recover the lost function of the pancreas. Of course, this is possible in those cases without insulin receptor dysfunction only.""The boy went 24 months without insulin after following the Paleo diet. Photo: IJCRIThe boy in the study went without insulin for 24 months. The success is undoubtedly remarkable, even if he moved on to insulin injections afterwards.Not only did the boy go two years without insulin, but his blood sugar levels were significantly lower on the Paleolithic ketogenic diet compared to his six weeks of insulin therapy. He didn't have any complications or episodes of hypoglycemia, and the study authors stressed that the diet can be sustainable in the long-term.They noted, though, that patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes are likely to have exhausted beta cells, and the need for insulin replacement could be unavoidable. ""In these cases, however, the Paleolithic ketogenic diet may be used as an adjunct in an attempt to likely prevent diabetic complications,"" said the researchers.What significance do these findings have for type 1 diabetes?""Our findings indicate that patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes may have another option to choose,"" said Dr. Tóth.The boy in the study went without insulin for 24 months. The success is undoubtedly remarkable, even if he moved on to insulin injections afterwards.""This is a treatment requiring much more from the patient and his/her environment in terms of motivation, cooking techniques, personal burden of resisting against the mainstream etc. However, once realised, the method may offer a much better outcome of the disease.""It should be noted, though, that when Dr. Tóth says the Paleolithic ketogenic diet could be a treatment option for type 1 diabetes, he doesn't mean as a replacement for insulin injections.The diet could help newly diagnosed type 1 patients with residual insulin secretion be without insulin for a short-term period, but the benefits that extend to people with long-standing type 1 include better glycemic control and the potential to prevent diabetic complications.Of course, these findings refer to just one boy. Further research on a larger scale will be needed to confirm the results among people with type 1 diabetes of different durations. However, the Paleolithic ketogenic diet appears to be a fascinating area for future type 1 diabetes research.Do you have any experience of the Paleolithic ketogenic diet? Has it helped improve your blood glucose levels?Picture: thepaleodiet.com",https://t.co/edTDcAnd25,others

Key House oversight panel to investigate rising cost of insulin,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), chair of the House oversight panel that's currently investigating the rising cost of insulin, announced today that her committee will hold its first of two hearings on the skyrocketing cost of the drug next Tuesday, April 2, at 10:30 a.m. ET.DeGette made the announcement while speaking at a health care policy summit on Tuesday where she told the crowd that her panel will hold two formal hearings this month to determine what Congress can do to make the life-saving drug more accessible to the millions of Americans who rely on it to survive.""The insulin pricing issue is a microcosm of what's going on throughout the prescription drug area,"" DeGette said. ""This is a drug that's been around for nearly one hundred years but, for some reason, has more than doubled in price over the last decade. In holding these hearings, we want to know what's going on and what Congress can do to help bring down the cost of this drug for the millions of Americans who need it to survive.""More than seven million Americans rely on insulin to maintain their blood sugar, but the steadily increasing price of the drug – which has more than doubled in recent years – has made it unaffordable for some patients who are now forced to take drastic steps, such as rationing their medication, in order to survive.DeGette, who has long been a leading advocate for Americans with diabetes, serves not only as chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, but also as co-chair of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus.In her role as co-chair of the Diabetes Caucus, DeGette launched a bipartisan inquiry into the rising cost of insulin last year to determine what Congress could do to make it more affordable for consumers.That inquiry led DeGette to release a bipartisan report in November that contained several policy recommendations for Congress to focus on in trying to combat the rising price of the drug – including, increasing competition among drug manufacturers, creating a standardized system for consumers to appeal an insurer's decision to deny coverage, and allowing consumers to pay the same price that wholesalers and pharmacies pay for certain drugs.Earlier this year, just weeks after taking over as the new chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel, DeGette sent letters to the heads of Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi – the three top manufactures of insulin in the U.S. – asking them to explain the rapidly increasing cost of insulin and why they are not providing a more affordable treatment to patients in need.DeGette plans to use the responses she received from those three drug makers as the foundation for the upcoming hearings.Next Tuesday's hearing, which will begin at 10:30 a.m. EST, will take place in room 2322 of the Rayburn House Office Building. A full list of the witnesses who will be testifying at the hearing will be released later this week. While a date for the second hearing has not yet been confirmed, it will be in April.Copies of the letters DeGette sent to the three manufacturers of insulin are available here.A copy of the bipartisan report DeGette released in Nov. 2018 is available here.",https://t.co/mA2bPeLHHL,others
Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-1 treatment stabilizes the microvascular cytoskeleton under ischemic conditions.,"Our previous studies showed that Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-1 reduced blood brain barrier permeability and decreased infarct volume caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in middle aged female rats. Similarly, cultures of primary brain microvessel endothelial cells from middle-aged female rats and exposed to stroke-like conditions (oxygen glucose deprivation; OGD) confirmed that IGF-1 reduced dye transfer across this cell monolayer. Surprisingly, IGF-1 did not attenuate endothelial cell death caused by OGD. To reconcile these findings, the present study tested the hypothesis that, at the earliest phase of ischemia, IGF-1 promotes barrier function by increasing anchorage and stabilizing cell geometry of surviving endothelial cells. Cultures of human brain microvessel endothelial cells were subject to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence of IGF-1, IGF-1 + JB-1 (IGFR inhibitor) or vehicle. OGD disrupted the cell monolayer and reduced cell-cell interactions, which was preserved in IGF-1-treated cultures and reversed by concurrent treatment with JB-1. IGF-1-mediated preservation of the endothelial monolayer was reversed with LY294002 treatment, but not by Rapamycin, indicating that IGF-1 s actions on cell-cell contacts are likely mediated via the PI3K pathway. In vivo, microvessel morphology was evaluated in middle-aged female rats that were subjected to ischemia by MCAo, and treated ICV with IGFI, IGF-1 + JB-1, or artificial CSF (aCSF; vehicle) after reperfusion. Compared to vehicle controls, IGF-1 treated animals displayed larger microvessel diameters in the peri-infarct area and increased staining density for vinculin, an anchorage protein. Both these measures were reversed by concurrent IGF-1 + JB-1 treatment. Moreover these effects were restricted to 24 h after ischemia-reperfusion and no treatment effects were seen at 5d post stroke. Collectively, these data suggest that in the earliest hours during ischemia, IGF-1 promotes receptor-mediated anchorage of endothelial cells, and its actions may be accurately characterized as vasculoprotective.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Insulin Pump Shown Difficult for Many Users,"MiniMed 670G system (Medtronic Inc.)25 Mar. 2019. An assessment of a closed-loop insulin pump system shows a sizeable proportion of first-time users stopped using its automated feature because of problems in making it work. A team from Boston Children's Hospital reported their findings yesterday at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in New Orleans.Researchers led by endocrinologist Gregory Goodwin, also a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, sought real-world evidence on the practical utility of the Medtronic MiniMed 670G, a closed-loop hybrid insulin pump system, sometimes called an artificial pancreas. The Food and Drug Administration in September 2016 cleared the MiniMed 670G for marketing to people age 14 and up — later extended to children as young as 7 — with type 1 diabetes, an inherited autoimmune disorder where the body does not produce insulin, and is diagnosed primarily in children or young adults. About 1.25 million people in the U.S. have type 1 diabetes, about 5 percent of people with diabetes of any kind.The MiniMed 670G is called an artificial pancreas because it can monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin flow with little or no intervention by the wearer. However, people wearing the device still may need to manually increase an insulin dose to account for carbohydrate increases at meal times, and periodically calibrate the sensor. The system monitors glucose levels with the sensor attached to the body, and pumps insulin through an infusion patch and catheter, while an algorithm controls the device, keeping glucose levels in personalized target range.Despite being hailed as a ""groundbreaking"" and ""life-changing"" development, anecdotal evidence persists about the MiniMed 670G's difficulty to use, particularly in auto-mode where the system automatically adjusts insulin flow to correspond to the wearer's glucose levels. Goodwin and colleagues reviewed the experiences of 83 children and young adults, age 6 to 25 — most were teenagers — who tried the MiniMed 670G for the first time, in May to September 2018. All of the participants in the study previously used insulin pumps or were familiar with continuous glucose monitoring, and were trained by company representatives in the system's use.The team reports nearly 1 in 5 participants, 16 individuals or 19 percent, stopped using the MiniMed 670G in auto-mode during this time. The main reasons for discontinuing auto-mode features were technical difficulties with the sensor or keeping the device in auto-mode, with the system forcing exits on occasion. Other reasons cited were calibration requirements, problems with sensor durability or adhesion, and skin irritation. The remaining 67 participants or 81 percent continued to use auto-mode, although the percent of time with this feature ranged from 10 to 90 percent.The researchers followed-up with 58 of the 67 auto-mode users and found they benefited from the MiniMed 670G. Blood glucose levels from the participants' hemoglobin a1c data showed an average decrease of 0.27 percent after 97 days, compared to readings taken in the 6 months before starting on the system, a difference large enough for statistical reliability.""Patients can reap the full benefits of the system in auto-mode,"" says Goodwin in an Endocrine Society statement. ""But this technology is demanding and requires a technically sophisticated patient or parent to use it.""More from Science &amp; Enterprise:* * *Please share Science &amp; Enterprise ...",https://t.co/PJBaNprHPR,others
Insulin crisis: Skyrocketing prices sending patients to Canada,"The American Diabetes Association says the average price of insulin tripled between 2002 and 2013. That's sending many Americans to Canada, where they pay up to 10 times less per vial. The FDA allows it if it's for personal use and a three-month supply or less. The rising prices are also causing diabetics in this country to skip doses or ration their insulin, which can mean serious complications or death. Adam Kozie is an insulin-dependent diabetic. His cost of a vial of insulin shot up from $40 to $135, even though he has insurance. ""I was exasperated, paying so much for my drugs. I need this to keep myself alive,"" Kozie said. Kozie's doctor, Irl Hirsch, professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told him he could drive to Canada, save money and get more than the one-month supply. ""That's a huge benefit to being able to buy in Canada without a prescription, is that I have a fridge full of insulin right now. If something goes wrong, I have a huge supply of the thing that I need to stay alive,"" Kozie said. A diabetic himself, Hirsch has studied insulin prices for decades. He said Humalog went from $24 a vial when it came out in 1996 to $300 full retail now. People can get Humalog in Canada for $32 Canadian. ""That means they're making money on that $30 vial of insulin, which in the U.S. at retail cost is 10 times that price,"" Hirsch said. ""It just infuriates me to no end that this drug that we've had for almost 100 years is inaccessible for so many people."" He said the difference is Canada regulates drug costs, the U.S. does not. ""We are now hearing of not just hospitalizations for people who have rationed or run out of their insulin, but now, this year, we are hearing of deaths,"" Hirsch said. He said he'll keep fighting until insulin is accessible and affordable, and he hopes change is coming. Several insulin makers are named in a class action lawsuit for alleged price fixing. The companies themselves are launching programs to make insulin more affordable, especially for the 3.2 million uninsured Americans. Patients do have another option now in the U.S.: they can buy less expensive human or synthetic insulin for as little as $25 at Walmart. But it's an older insulin and may act differently.

MIT Invents Smart Pill That Injects Insulin Into Your Stomach,"Goodbye InjectionsHundreds of millions of people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Their bodies either can't produce or process insulin properly — so they have to regularly inject themselves with shots of freeze-dried insulin.But researchers at MIT may have found a futuristic solution: a high-tech smart pill called SOMA — yes, we get the Aldous Huxley reference, but it also stands for ""self-orienting millimeter-scale applicator"" — that releases periodic doses of insulin into your stomach with an integrated needle.""We are really hopeful that this new type of capsule could someday help diabetic patients and perhaps anyone who requires therapies that can now only be given by injection or infusion,"" said Robert Langer, an MIT professor and senior author of the study, in a statement.VIDEOTortoise InspirationThe curvature of the pill's shell ensures it always stays upright. And that's important: the pill needs to keep contact with the stomach lining. The shape itself is based on the leopard tortoise, which has the ability to self-right from any orientation.The pill contains exactly the same kind of freeze-dried insulin as found in today's insulin injection kits, but compressed. It takes roughly an hour for the insulin to be fully released. The pill will then make its way safely through the digestive tract.The researchers have already successfully shown the pill's ability to release insulin in animal trials using pigs.Diabetics RejoiceThe pill could have groundbreaking implications for diabetics everywhere.""We are not talking about incremental improvements in insulin absorption, which is what most researchers in the field have done so far,"" Maria José Alonso, a professor of biopharmaceutics and pharmaceutical technology at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain told MIT News.

Inulin Boosts Insulin Sensitivity in Overweight Adults,"Supplements that raised colonic levels of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate improved insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic overweight people, reported British researchers.As shown in their small randomized crossover trial, published online in Gut, boosting the SCFA propionate had distinct positive effects on the gut microbiota, plasma metabolome, and systemic inflammatory responses.""Strategies that promote colonic propionate production may represent a more targeted route to improve glucose homeostasis in individual patients, depending on the underlying mechanisms contributing to the metabolic disorder,"" wrote Edward S. Chambers, PhD, of Imperial College London, and colleagues.With the increasing global obesity burden, manipulating gut microbiota-generated SCFAs to protect against energy-dense diets offers a potential avenue for regulating metabolic health and cardiovascular disease risk. Improved whole-body insulin sensitivity after increased dietary fiber intake has been linked to increased colonic production of the three major SCFAs -- acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are end products of dietary fiber fermentation by the gut bacteria.""Research has shown that SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota can improve insulin sensitivity,"" Chambers told MedPage Today. ""The present work demonstrates that raising the production of one of these SCFAs, propionate, has a distinct impact on the physiological processes that contribute to metabolic health.""In previous research, long-term colonic propionate delivery reduced levels of non-esterified fatty acid, a recognized contributor to β-cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance.The next step, Chambers said, is to determine whether the other major SCFAs, acetate and butyrate, provoke this selective metabolic response. ""In the future, this could help with the design of treatments that promote a specific SCFA profile in the gut to target the mechanisms that are contributing to a patient's metabolic disorder,"" he said.Study DetailsThe randomized double-bind trial recruited 12 healthy but overweight volunteers with a mean age of 60 (range of 49-65) and a mean body-mass index of 29.8 (range of 26.2-37.0). Of these, nine were female and 11 were white. All were randomly assigned to receive 20 g daily for 42 days of the following supplements in crossover fashion:Inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to selectively deliver propionate to the colonInulin, a high-fermentability fiber controlCellulose, a low-fermentability fiber controlMetabolic responses, inflammatory markers, and gut bacterial composition were analyzed at the end of each 42-day supplementation period, and there was a washout period of at least 28 days between different supplementations.Both IPE and inulin supplementation similarly improved indices of insulin resistance compared with cellulose supplementation, although the authors had originally hypothesized that IPE would be superior to inulin in promoting glucose homeostasis, they noted. As measured by glucose homeostatic model assessment, the mean (± standard error of the mean) values were as follows:1.17±0.15 for inulin vs 1.59±0.17 for cellulose (P=0.009)1.23±0.17 for IPE vs 1.59±0.17 for cellulose (P=0.001)No difference between IPE and inulin (P=0.272)According to the Matsuda Insulin Sensitivity Index, the mean values were:4.0±0.7 for inulin vs 3.2±0.5 for cellulose (P=0.014)4.0±0.6 for IPE vs 3.2±0.6 for cellulose (P=0.002)In addition, IPE supplementation decreased proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-8 levels compared with cellulose, while inulin had no impact on systemic inflammatory markers. In vitro, peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy humans secrete were found to lessen IL-8 in media containing sodium propionate compared with both sodium acetate and sodium chloride.The researchers said that interestingly, despite the positive effects on metabolic markers, both IPE and inulin supplementation decreased the diversity of bacterial species compared with cellulose: ""This outcome appears counterintuitive given the commonly accepted association in humans between a lower gut bacterial diversity and poor health."" the authors wrote.Fasting insulin level following each supplementation period was associated with different plasma metabolome profiles. A positive association between plasma N-acetyl glycoproteins and fasting insulin was observed after cellulose supplementation but not after inulin or IPE supplementation. These glycoproteins have previously been linked to increased insulin resistance.Two amino acids were associated with fasting insulin levels only after inulin supplementation: tyrosine (positively) and glycine (negatively). Higher tyrosine is associated with increased insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes risk, while glycine correlates to reduced risk of these, Chambers and co-authors explained. ""Our data therefore indicate that the observed improvement in insulin sensitivity following inulin supplementation was related to a favourable modulation of amino acid metabolism.""As for the impact on fecal bacterial populations, compared with cellulose, inulin produced changes both at the class level, increasing Actinobacteria, to which health-promoting Bifidobacterium belongs, while decreasing pathogen-associated Clostridia, and at the order level, decreasing Clostridiales. Small differences between IPE and cellulose emerged at the species level, the researchers reported.They said the findings suggest that manipulating the colonic fermentation profile of a dietary fiber in favor of propionate promotes selective effects on mechanisms, contributing to metabolic dysregulation. ""It would be of interest to establish the individual effects of delivering acetate and butyrate to the colon as, in the future, this would support the development of fermentable carbohydrate that delivers a specific SCFA profile to improve metabolic health and glucose homeostasis,"" the team wrote.""This small study does not demonstrate a mechanism of action, but it's a step in the right direction,"" Thomas Schmidt, PhD, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, told MedPage Today.""It's consistent with other studies showing that if you provide fuel for the gut microbiome, it often has a beneficial effect,"" added Schmidt, who was not involved with the current research.Although the authors did not address study limitations, the small study sample and its focus only on the SCFA propionate were obvious constraints.MedPage Today previously reported on research by the Imperial College group showing that IPE was associated with less weight gain than dietary inulin.The research was supported by the U.K. Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Facility at Imperial College Healthcare, the National Health Services HS Trust, the U.K. Medical Research Council, the National Institutes of Health Research, and the Imperial Biomedical Research Centre Funding Scheme.Chambers reported having no conflicts related to the research; two coauthors reported applying for a patent on compounds related to appetite control and insulin sensitivity.Schmidt reported no conflicts of interest 1969-12-31T19:00:00-0500 last updated 04.14.2019",https://t.co/kBxvsa6uU4,others
News Bureau | ILLINOIS,"CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — Scientists at the University of Illinois have developed new hybrids of purple corn containing different combinations of phytochemicals that may fight obesity, inflammation and diabetes, a new study in mice indicates.The pericarp of purple corn kernels is loaded with healthy anthocyanins and could provide manufacturers with a natural form of pigments for foods and beverages.Photo by L. Brian StaufferDeleteEdit embedded media in the Files Tab and re-insert as needed.The pericarp – or outer layer – of purple and other brightly colored corn kernels also may provide an alternative source of colorants for food products, giving corn producers another value-added product from their crop, said the U. of I. team led by food science professor Elvira Gonzalez de Mejia and crop sciences professor John Juvik. They published their findings recently in the journal Food Chemistry.From a strain of maize called Apache Red, Juvik's team bred 20 genetic varieties of purple corn, each with a unique combination of anthocyanins, the nutritious, natural pigments that give the pericarp its vibrant color.Widely found in plant tissues, phenolic compounds tend to be aromatic and contribute to the color, flavor and acidity of fruits. Anthocyanins are one class of phenols, and studies have associated the consumption of anthocyanin-rich foods with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.Using pressurized water, postdoctoral researcher and study co-author Diego Luna-Vital extracted the anthocyanins from the pericarp of the corn kernels, creating anthocyanin-rich water extracts that were then freeze-dried. While analyses of the extracts showed that the pericarp is an abundant source of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, the concentration varied significantly among the varieties.To examine the impact of anthocyanins on obesity-induced inflammation, then-graduate student and first author of the study Qiaozhi Zhang combined fat cells – called adipocytes – from mice with large immune cells called macrophages.The mouse cell models in the study simulated those of obese people with high concentrations of lipids and inflammation in their cells, or healthy individuals who regularly eat plants containing phenolic compounds, de Mejia said. ""So these are very real models that can be translated into in vivo studies with humans or animals.""""We evaluated some very specific biomarkers already known to be related to inflammation and adipogenesis, which is the conversion of pre-adipocytes to mature adipocytes that accumulate fat,"" Luna-Vital said.They observed that the phenolic compounds in the extracts altered the cells' development, reducing the adipocytes' fat content from 8%-56%, depending on the differing phenols used.To study the compounds' impact on insulin resistance, the metabolic dysfunction associated with diabetes, the scientists used a cell-signaling protein to induce insulin resistance in the mouse fat cells, then treated the cells with the anthocyanin compounds and monitored their glucose uptake.A key marker of insulin resistance decreased by 29%-64%, they found, and the cells' glucose uptake decreased by 30%-139%, depending on the chemical composition of the anthocyanins used.""We observed very important changes in molecules that reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in the insulin-resistant adipocytes,"" Luna-Vital said. ""We also found important changes in pro-inflammatory molecules in the immune cells.""The findings suggested that different levels and chemical compositions of these phenolic compounds might prevent obesity or improve the insulin profile of people who are obese, Luna-Vital said.The smaller phenols such as quercetin, luteolin and rutin – which are present in many plant foods – played key roles in reducing some of the obesity, inflammation and some markers of Type 2 diabetes, de Mejia said. ""While others, such as vanillic and protocatechuic acid, decreased the potential conversion of pre-adipocytes to adipocytes.""She cautioned, though, that ""it's very important to note that it's not just one or two compounds, but the combinations of phenolics"" working together that were responsible for the beneficial effects.Graduate student and study co-author Laura Chatham currently is performing genomic selection to identify the DNA markers associated with the most promising health effects in order to breed corn hybrids with those properties, Juvik said.In addition to its health-promoting properties, the pericarp of red, purple and other brightly hued corn could serve as natural pigments for the food industry, satisfying strong consumer demand for alternatives to synthetic dyes, Juvik said. ""We calculated that all of the red dye No. 40 – one of the major dyes used in the U.S. – could be replaced with the pigment derived from about 600,000 acres of corn,"" Juvik said. ""And we could produce the anthocyanin-rich pericarp in sufficient quantities for manufacturers to add it to beverages or special products with pharmaceutical properties.""Another advantage to dried corn is that it's shelf-stable, providing an economical substitute for the perishable fruits and vegetables that manufacturers also currently use to color many foods and beverages, he said.""The advantage to using water to extract the anthocyanins from the pericarp is that it's the most simple, straightforward and inexpensive way for industry to remove these compounds, compared with other extraction protocols that are complicated and more expensive,"" Juvik said.Water extraction is also a ""green"" process, compliant with environmental and food and drug regulations, said de Mejia, also the director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences.U. of I. agricultural and biological engineering professors Vijay Singh and Deepak Kumar, and undergraduate student Subhiksha Chandrasekaran co-wrote the study, along with Tianyi Tao of Zhejiang University, China.The research was supported by a U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture grant.",https://t.co/eYO1XkmfZR,others
"Insulin Units and Conversion Factors: A Story of Truth, Boots, and Faster Half-Truths","AbstractConventional insulin concentration units (IU/mL or just U/mL) are bioefficacy based, whereas the Système International (SI) units (pmol/L) are mass based. In converting between these two different approaches, there are at least 2 well-accepted conversion factors, where there should be only 1. The correct value is not the most-used or well-accepted using online calculators, some journal styles, laboratory reports, and published articles. In short, an incorrect insulin conversion factor is widely used which underreports insulin concentrations by ~15%, with potentially significant research and clinical implications. This short commentary describes the history of insulin IU definitions and conversion factors, and highlights the widespread nature of conversion factor misuse, to provoke deeper interest and thought regarding numbers we so often use without thinking.1.Volund, A.

Fluoxetine Reaction? - www.the-investigating-mum.co.uk,"• My daughter was seen by CAMHS team psychologist for social anxiety, generalized depression and trichotillomania.• She was seen by a CAMHS team psychologist from 23rd October 2017 to 14th August 2018.• She was seen by a different CAMHS team psychologist from 14th August 2018 – 24th January 2019. Discharged as anxiety and depression now mild/moderate and self manageable rather than moderate/severe and chronic and unmanageable.•My daughter was seen by Psychiatrist at CAMHS from 19th Dec 2017 – ongoing with next appointment end of May 2019 to review hospital investigations.Fluoxetine started at 10mg on 17th Dec 2017Fluoxetine increased to 20mg on 2nd Jan 2018 (Trichotilomania started April 2018)Fluoxetine increased to 30mg on 19th June 2018Fluoxetine increased to 40 mg on 3rd July 2018 (Fatigue, pain, illness symptoms noticable by 7th Sep 2018)Fluoxetine ceased at my request on 19th Dec 2018(I felt the Fluoxetine may have been responsible for low range cortisol and all of her symptoms)I was assured by doctors, psychiatrists and pharmasists that Fluoxetine would be out of her system in 12 days. What they failed to mention or maybe didnt even know themselves is Fluoxetine is a fat soluble drug meaning every single cell of the body from brain tissue to organ tissue to gland tissue to muscle tissue has absorbed this medication and it could take as long as 12 months to metabolse and excrete it.No return of anxiety or depression since stopping the Fluoxetine.A dramatic decrease in trichotillomania episodes. Could all the symptoms be from Fluoxetine medication? At the beginning of November I had asked GP for a repeat prescription for the 40mg Fluoxetine as CAMHS had stopped doing repeat prescriptons. The GP questioned the high dose considering her age. He asked me to check with psychiatrist at CAMHS..6th November 2018 - met with psychiatrist who assured me the 40mg was fine and my daughter's anxiety symptoms were managed well by it. He re-prescribed the 40mg.7th December 2018 - I found a research paper about Fluoxetine lowering cortisol levels in rats. I realized not a single doctor that we had seen had considered that her symptoms were a reaction, side effect to the Fluoxetine. No one had even mentioned that Fluoxetine can lower cortisol, it is not on the list of known side affects.Fluoxetine Side EffectsFluoxetine and Cortisol in Rats 'Conclusion: By affecting the activity of different levels of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal hormones axis, fluoxetin decreases the level of cortisol hormones.'There are also studies that show antidepressants can lower ACTH production, causing a lower cortisol production.ACTH and Cortisol with Fluoxetine'The subgroup with baseline hypercortisolemia [mean cortisol &gt;276 nmol/l (10 microg/dl), n=18] demonstrated a reduction in both cortisol and ACTH following treatment'I was now worried that every time I have allowed her to have this medication she has been reacting and in essence being poisoned by the medication. I knew that she would not be safe to just stop the medication because of withdraw, but continuing to give it to her scared me- it was the weekend I had no one to ask. I was beside myself with worry and fear and upset. On the morning of Saturday 8th December I spoke to both a GP and a pharmacist from CCG via NHS111 both agreed I could drop her to 20mg for the weekend then try and speak with psychiatrist on Monday morning The pharmacist said the half shelf like is 3-4 days so we should not expect to see massive changes for up to 12 days if the medication is causing the side affects after the 12th day there would be significant improvements. She was also worried about withdraw symptoms because of the length of time she has been on the medication. She said from about 5 days in there could be signs she is struggling with the halved dose being 2 extreme.10th December 2018 - I spoke with the psychiatrist who suggested stopping the Fluoxetine immediately for possible adverse physical health symptoms. I discussed at length my concern re my own research and the pharmacists warning on Saturday about suddenly stopping the medication. He said he would think on it and speak to the trust pharmacist and call me back n Wednesday 12th December.There is LOTS of research and evidence online about how Fluoxetine affects cortisol. Most people don't have their cortisol regularily checked- in factmy daughter wouldn't have unless I had requested it, no medical person thought to test it.Fluoxetine alters cortisol levels'Plasma cortisol and fluoxetine levels were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods with applying Shimadzu chromatograph with UV detection. Plasma cortisol and fluoxetine levels were measured at time zero (before therapy) and after 6h, 24h, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of fluoxetine administration in patients with major depression qualified for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The study included 21 patients (14 women, 7 men; mean age 29-75 years) and 24 healthy comparison subjects. The patients had a mean score on the 21-item HDRS. As the effect of fluoxetine administration the decrease of the level of cortisol was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (the reduction of points in HDRS scale in at least 50%)' About Fluoxetine (My daughter was on 40mg from June 2018)NHS info on Fluoxetine The usual dose of fluoxetine is 20mg a day in adults. However, you may be started at a lower dose which is gradually increased to a maximum dose of 60mg a day. Some people might need to take a lower dose of fluoxetine, or to take it less often. This includes people with liver problems, and elderly people. The usual dose of fluoxetine in children is 10mg a day but this may be increased to 20mg a day. An overdose can lead to potentially serious symptoms such as: vomiting shaking feeling sleepy agitation heart problems lung problems seizures However, taking fluoxetine for more than a year has been linked to a small increased risk of getting diabetes. But you will be regularly checked for this. (my daughter has never been offered any sort of screening for being on Fluoxetine for so long)If you stop taking fluoxetine suddenly you may get unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. These include: dizziness feeling sick numbness or tingling in the hands or feet trouble sleeping feeling agitated or anxious headaches shakingRisks from withdraw Coming off Fluoxetine You should always talk to your GP, prescriber or pharmacist if you are thinking of stopping your antidepressants. A dose of antidepressants should be slowly reduced: over 1 to 2 weeks if treatment has lasted less than 8 weeks over 6 to 8 weeks if treatment has lasted 6 to 8 months This is because although antidepressants are not classed as addictive medicines, they can cause serious withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly. These symptoms may be entirely new or similar to some of the original symptoms of the illness.",https://t.co/rM75KfOZ4W,others
Sleep Easy - Royal Brompton Hospital,"Getting the right treatment for sleep disorders is vital for patient welfareObstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is one of the most common respiratory disorders. And due to our ageing population and high levels of obesity, it's prevalence is increasing. But OSA often goes undiagnosed in the general population, and vital questions remain about who should be treated and when.What is sleep apnoea?Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea have recurrent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. These repeated interruptions in breathing result in intermittent oxygen desaturation and fragment, poor quality sleep.Obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, heart failure, stroke, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance, depression, a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of road traffic accidents.It is also linked to the impairment of multiple aspects of cognition, and has been implicated in the early onset of cognitive decline by as much as a decade. Research suggests that OSA should also be recognised as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.The mechanism of cognitive impairment is thought to include neuro-inflammation, oxidative stress, and increased sympathetic activity.""The primary treatment for OSA is continuous positive airways pressure, which provides a pneumatic splint to the upper airway.""How is OSA diagnosed?Typical symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea include daytime sleepiness or fatigue, snoring and witnessed apnoeas at night, and nocturia. The diagnosis is confirmed with a respiratory sleep study, which may be performed in hospital or in a patient's home.What is the treatment for OSA?The primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea is continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), which provides a pneumatic splint to the upper airway, preventing collapse and consequent intermittent hypoxia. Randomised controlled trials have shown that treatment of sleep apnoea with CPAP therapy can improve blood pressure which control in patients with systemic hypertension with the greatest benefits seen in patients with more severe sleep apnoea and in those patient with resistant hypertension.Treating sleep apnoea with CPAP therapy has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes and appears to improve neurocognitive architecture and function.Weight loss significantly improves the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea, in obese patients. In patients with mild OSA and/or without marked obesity, or those with a recessed jaw, oral appliances (mandibular advancement devices) may be effective. In some patients with positional OSA, using a wedge to prevent supine positioning may be recommended.Who should be referred for treatment?Dr Alanna Hare recommends individuals experiencing daytime sleepiness should be screened for obstructive sleep apnoea.There is no definitive guidance on who to treat with CPAP and when. CPAP therapy is recommended in patients with moderate or severe OSA. The role of CPAP in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnoea is less clear.At Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield Hospitals Specialist Care, we have a highly experienced team that has been diagnosing and treating adult patients with sleep disorders for more than 20 years. Our service for sleep-related problems is one of the largest in Europe. We have an international reputation for our work with patients experiencing sleep disorders.Using the latest equipment, we can monitor progress remotely using advanced telemonitoring systems and CPAP titration devices to identify and resolve problems quickly, improve compliance and ensure optimum control of sleep apnoea.How is OSA different to insomnia?Insomnia is defined as daytime impairment or distress due to difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or non-restorative sleep, even though the sufferer has had adequate opportunity to sleep. It affects around one in three people in the UK, particularly women and older people. To classify as insomnia, incidents must occur at least three times per week for at least one month.Insufficient sleep has widespread impacts on physical health and mental wellbeing.Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is the recommended first line of treatment for insomnia lasting more than one month. CBTi incorporates behavioural management, including stimulus control therapy and sleep restriction, as well as cognitive strategies that aim to address the individual's thoughts and beliefs about sleep. It also uses relaxation techniques, sometimes including mindfulness therapy, to address the hyperarousal that commonly contributes to insomnia.Research suggests that CBTi is effective in reducing sleep onset latency (time taken to fall asleep), wake after sleep onset (time spent awake at night), sleep efficiency, and sleep quality, and that these effects endure over time.How can we help?At Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield Hospitals Specialist Care, our sleep services include:consultations and treatment for private patientshome sleep studies and home set-up on CPAP therapyaccess to latest CPAP devices and masksdedicated Centre for Sleep, for more detailed inpatient sleep studiesrespiratory sleep studies and full polysomnographycognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, with personalised sleep programmeshighly experienced support teamlatest telemonitoring equipment to improve treatment compliance and enable the rapid resolution of problems, without needing to attend clinic in person.Dr Alanna HareConsultant physician in sleep and respiratory medicine",https://t.co/sqtAwcbZBd,others
Prices of select insulin shoots up to 20% in one yr,"Chennai: Fluctuating US Dollar has pushed prices of insulin pens, cartridges and basal insulin by up to 20% over the last few months, thereby pushing up medical bills of diabetics in India. Diabetologists say, nearly a third of of their insulin dependent patients are now paying more for their daily medication. Data sourced from the online medical store, Netmeds, show that cost of basal insulin — the type of insulin that regulates glucose levels between meals preventing low sugar, and premixed varieties that come in pens and cartridges have gone up anywhere between 3.5% to 20.9% between January and December 2018. For instance, the cost of insulin pens sold by pharma giant Eli Lilli and Company has gone up by Rs 134 in December 2018 from Rs 640 in January. This is a 20.9% increase in a year, while Basalog One 100IU Pen Injection from Biocon went up by Rs 79 or nearly 10% higher increase to the current price of Rs 823.1. The cost of basal insulin by Sanofi went up by Rs 277 to Rs 2,983 in 2018 per vial.Companies said the fluctuation in US Dollar prices over the last few months has pushed up costs and hence a price increase. ""For the products made in India, prices have been stable. Some products, like pens, cartridges and basal insulin are imported. Cost for most such products has gone up. Commonly used insulin that can be drawn into syringes from vials haven't gone up,"" said pharma analyst R Srinivasan. However strict vigilance by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, has helped maintain pointless price rise, he added. The International Diabetes Federation data shows that the prevalence of diabetes among people between 20 – 79 years of age in India is 72.9 million. In Chennai more than a fifth of its population are diabetics.Although less than a quarter of the patients across the country take insulin, at least 30% of those are prescribed basal insulin. Nearly a third of diabetics in India are prescribed basal insulin. ""These insulins are given to patients when there is a need. We also see if they can afford them,"" said award winning senior diabetologist Dr V Mohan. The cost of managing diabetes is mostly out of pocket as most health insurers don't pay for outpatient therapy and drugs. The average monthly expense for a diabetic comes to be anywhere between Rs 3,000 to Rs 8,000 per month. In case of hospitalisation, it can cost anywhere between Rs 40,000 to Rs 1.5lakh for medical management including intensive care. For instance, 46-year-old chartered accountant Srinivasan R was advised a switch over — from human insulin on vials to basal insulin two years ago, after he complained about palpitation and dizziness at work. ""Tests show that my sugar levels were dropping down to dangerously low levels at certain times when the insulin is at its peak. My sugar levels were also fluctuating through the day The basal insulin acts uniformly through day and I found the change comfortable,"" he said. But Srinivasan, who was paying around was paying around Rs 2,700 for this insulin till mid-2018, has to pay at least Rs 2,980 now. ""This would mean at least Rs 5,000 more for me every year. Medical insurance doesn't fund it,"" he said.",https://t.co/JCtiIF6D9K,others
Insulin Resistance Diet - To Age Or Not To Age - Documentary By Leslie Kenton,"To Age Or Not To Age - Documentary By Leslie Kenton from Leslie Kenton's Cura Romana. Like this? Watch the latest episode of Leslie Kenton's Cura Romana on Blip! http://blip.tv/leslie-kentons-cura-ro... As an awareness of the Syndrome X phenomenon of insulin resistance spread, researchers and clinicians have begun to understand that many of us who are not diabetic still experience insulin resistance. Responsible scientists began to ask questions about what causes it. The discoveries they are now making are nothing short of revolutionary. They not only offer us the power to slow the rate at which our bodies age. They are experimenting with protocols that can, potentially reverse negative conditions from hypertension, insulin resistance to cholesterol imbalances and depression, simply by changing the way you eat and live. This experience is one I became fascinated with when, several years ago, I made a television documentary in the Southern Hemisphere called To Age or Not To Age. It asked the question, ?Can we slow aging by making simple nutritional changes?? We also wanted to know ?Might it also be possible to reverse age-related degeneration that has already occurred?? And, finally, ?Can these things be verified in medically measurable ways?? We decided to carry out what is known as a base-line study to find out. We sent all participants to have the standard test of medical parameters checked before the project began?from fasting insulin and blood sugar levels through cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure. These were carried out at a hospital which also had an excellent physiology laboratory, where exercise physiologists were able to establish each participant?s VO2Max, body fat percentage and lean body mass to fat ratio. To my surprise, every participant?including a 50 year old top athlete?showed abnormalities associated with Syndrome X. We then introduced our group to an Insulin Balance way of eating, which I devised. The experiment lasted only 5 weeks. Then we sent all our participants back to the hospital to have their parameters checked again. The results were mind-blowing. We had no idea that, after only 5 weeks of dietary changes, every abnormal medical parameter had normalized, except for cholesterol measurements in one woman, which took another few weeks to normalize. For me personally, the experiment confirmed yet again that the human body has a phenomenal capacity to heal itself, when given the opportunity to experience transformation at the deepest levels. This is a truth which, for the past four years, I have applied to helping to transform the lives of men and women all over the world, whom I have been mentoring on Cura Romana. The results continue to delight me.See all episodes of Leslie Kenton's Cura Romana http://blip.tv/leslie-kentons-cura-ro...Visit Leslie Kenton's Cura Romana's series page http://blip.tv/leslie-kentons-cura-ro...",https://t.co/Bn9MlQRsMH,others
Scientist story: Towards a cure,"Over the course of more than two decades, Jacob Sten Petersen has researched multiple chronic diseases, contributing to the approval of five licensed medicines in the process. But it was the unmet need of people living with type 1 diabetes, the less common form of the disease, that most struck a chord with the biochemist and Doctor of Medical Sciences who today oversees Novo Nordisk's stem cell research and development efforts.""The simple fact that people living with type 1 diabetes can never take a break from their disease has always particularly motivated me,"" explains Jacob. ""That's not to say that it is easy to live with other chronic diseases, but for these people, and particularly for children, their dependence on insulin therapy and the constant management of the disease is a significant burden that I've always been passionate about reducing.""Little did Jacob know it, but fate would see him personally experience the burden that had for so long been his primary source of motivation. In 2016, more than 20 years after he began researching a cure for type 1 diabetes, his three-year-old daughter Vita was diagnosed with the disease.""Vita's symptoms approached so quietly and unexpectedly that despite my medical training and line of work, it didn't initially occur to me that she could have diabetes,"" recalls Jacob. ""But the moment I first tested her blood glucose will stay with me forever. I knew there and then that Vita's life had in an instant become significantly more challenging. It was truly life changing."" Even for Jacob, a leading researcher, published author and frequent contributor to the world's leading diabetes conferences, the learning curve that accompanied the diagnosis of a child with type 1 diabetes was steep.""I felt that I knew a great deal about life with diabetes,"" explains Jacob. ""But in reality, I didn't truly understand what it is like to live with a chronic disease until Vita was diagnosed. We were faced with 100 decisions a day to help manage her blood glucose and to ensure her wellbeing. It really was an eye-opener for me.""Vita's diagnosis carried a heavy toll for Jacob and his family as they came to terms with it emotionally and recalibrated their daily lives to accommodate the management of her disease. But as the dust settled and the family adjusted to their new reality, Jacob's outlook evolved from one of sadness to one of positivity.""I came to realise that helping Vita to live with diabetes was a daily learning experience that was teaching me about the real needs of people living with the disease,"" reflects Jacob. ""My work had always been important, but it took on a whole new meaning. Vita's diagnosis put things in perspective and I became thankful for my skills and the fact that when I go to work, I'm able to strive towards a better future for my daughter and for people just like her.""The future that Jacob has in mind includes a cure for type 1 diabetes – something that he and his colleagues have been pursuing using stem cell therapy since 1998. Two decades of research and a partnership with Cornell University have led the team to a stage where they have demonstrated 'proof of concept'– curing diabetic rodents using encapsulated insulin-producing stem cells.""I am delighted that our efforts are finally beginning to bear fruit,"" says Jacob. ""There is still much work to be done, but we hope that we will be able to initiate the first clinical trial in humans within a few years.""As with the development of any novel treatment, pitfalls line the path to success and there are no guarantees of a positive outcome. But Jacob is hopeful and is able to begin to imagine a life for Vita in which she is free from the daily management of her diabetes.""Vita is six years old today,"" he says. ""If we can deliver on our research within 15 years, she could be cured of type 1 diabetes by the time she is 20. On a personal level, I could not be more motivated in the pursuit of our goal.""",https://t.co/u6nrWPInyq,others

Meal Times Have a Big Influence on the Body Clock,"It seems that while what we eat is very important to our health, when we have our meals has an impact on our bodies as well. Researchers have learned more about how the timing of food intake influences our body's internal clock or circadian rhythm. The findings, which have been reported in Cell show that insulin is a critical signal that can match meal times to the circadian rhythm. This work may help those that disrupt the body clock (such as by traveling or working nights) to relieve the negative health effects caused by such disruptions. The short video below outlines the work.""We already know that modern society poses many challenges to our health and wellbeing - things that are viewed as commonplace, such as shift-work, sleep deprivation, and jet lag, disrupt our body clock. It is now becoming clear that circadian disruption is increasing the incidence and severity of many diseases, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes,"" noted Dr. David Bechtold, a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester.The cells in our bodies can respond to the 24-hour cycle that helps govern aspects of our physiology; the circadian rhythm helps control hormone levels, sleep and wakefulness, and other parts of our daily life. Cues from the environment, like daylight and mealtimes, help set the rhythm. Synchronizing our body's clock to the environmental cycle is important to health. Disruptions to the rhythm are harmful to health, and eating at weird times is thought to be one major disruptor. As such, researchers want to learn more about how our body clocks sense and respond to the timing of meals. In this work, scientists from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge and the University of Manchester found that a molecule that controls the level of glucose in the blood, insulin, is a vital signal, communicating meal times to the circadian clocks of the body. The researchers used cell culture and a mouse model to show that after eating, as the body releases insulin, cells adjust their circadian rhythms. They do so through a protein that works as part of the body clock, called PERIOD.""At the heart of these cellular clocks is a complex set of molecules whose interaction provides precise 24-hour timing. What we have shown here is that the insulin, released when we eat, can act as a timing signal to cells throughout our body,"" explained the leader of the Cambridge team Dr. John O'Neill, of the MRC LMB. If mice were exposed to insulin at odd times, such as when they would otherwise be sleeping, it altered their circadian rhythm.""Our data suggests that eating at the wrong times could have a major impact on our circadian rhythms. There is still work to do here, but paying particular attention to meal timing and light exposure is likely the best way to mitigate the adverse effects of shift-work. Even for those who work more traditional hours, being careful about when we eat is an important way to help maintain healthy body clocks, especially as we age,"" explained lead author Dr. Priya Crosby, a researcher at the MRC LMB.Sources: AAAS/Eurekalert! via MRC, Cell",https://t.co/EEKpMKVkRT,others
Does Walmart Sell Insulin for $25 a Vial Without a Prescription?,"In early February 2019, amid continued public outcry over the soaring cost of life-saving pharmaceuticals, readers shared a screen-captured image on social media of a local news station's reporting on the story of a woman who said she bought inexpensive insulin without a prescription at Walmart:Readers asked us whether this was true. It is true, although you should note Walmart sells human insulin, an older version of the glucose-moderating hormone, whereas most insulin-dependent diabetics are currently prescribed insulin analogs that have evolved to help prevent dangerous swings in blood-glucose levels.The screenshot above was taken from a 4 February 2019 news broadcast from Dallas–Fort Worth television station KDFW:We confirmed with Walmart that the retail chain does indeed sell human insulin without a prescription (except in Indiana). That product is Novo Nordisk-manufactured Novolin, which Walmart has branded as ReliOn and sells for $24.88 per vial. Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis confirmed to us that the company has ""maintained, through negotiation, the same retail to patients since 2011."" To say that the insulin is sold ""over-the-counter"" isn't quite accurate, however, as customers must ask a pharmacist for it.Although this revelation might be important, life-saving information for diabetics, an important caveat is that human insulin behaves differently than the newer analog insulin currently retailing for more than $300 a vial.Dr. Todd Hobbs, chief medical officer for Novo Nordisk, wrote that the different types of insulin have the same effect of lowering blood-glucose levels, but, ""Training is required whenever someone is prescribed insulin, whether that be human insulin or the newer analog insulin products. Differences in the timing of all types of insulin must be considered for patients to effectively use them … The difference in the types of insulin is related to how slowly or rapidly they are absorbed once injected. Scientific advances over the years have made improvements on the speed and length of time this absorption occurs.""Diabetes Forecast, a health-oriented magazine associated with the American Diabetics Association, explained the history of the two types of insulin and the difference in health benefits this way:In the 1970s, researchers discovered how to program bacteria in the lab to manufacture human insulin, and in 1982, regular human insulin became the first ""recombinant DNA"" drug product. ""It's a very pure, clean product, and it's exactly what we as humans make,"" [Virginia Commonwealth University School of Pharmacy associate professor and a spokesman for the American Association of Diabetes Educators Evan] Sisson says. Human insulin is now available as short-acting ""regular"" (or ""R"") insulin, which is used at mealtimes, and intermediate-acting NPH (or ""N"") insulin, which is used as a basal insulin …While the development of human insulin was a major advancement, it wasn't perfect. Regular insulin didn't hit the bloodstream quick enough to cover the rapid absorption of carbohydrates after meals, and it stuck around too long after meals, causing hypoglycemia [low blood glucose, which can lead to unconsciousness and death if untreated]. In 1996, Eli Lilly introduced the first rapid-acting insulin analog to the market: insulin lispro (Humalog). Insulin aspart (Novo Nordisk's Novolog) and insulin glulisine (Sanofi's Apidra) quickly followed. With rapid-acting insulin analogs, onset occurs 10 to 20 minutes after injection, instead of the 30 to 60 minutes it takes for regular human insulin to take effect. This allows people to inject their insulin right before a meal, rather than having to dose 30 minutes or more before eating …Deliver a dose of NPH [human] insulin, and it'll reach its peak about six to eight hours later. This means your insulin may peak while you're sleeping, posing a serious danger if you don't wake up to treat. Long-acting analogs, on the other hand, don't peak, resulting in more-stable blood glucose levels and fewer unexpected highs or lows. In fact, one study showed that long-acting analog insulin glargine reduced overnight bouts of hypoglycemia by up to 48 percent compared with NPH. In another study, detemir reduced nighttime hypoglycemia by 34 percent. This is especially beneficial for people with type 1, who need to be much more precise about matching insulin dosages with their insulin needs to avoid nighttime lows, says Sisson.Note, there are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetics' bodies cannot manufacture insulin, the hormone responsible for glucose absorption. Type 2 diabetics' bodies, on the other hand, become resistant to insulin. In most cases, Type 1 diabetes starts in childhood, whereas Type 2 is sometimes referred to as ""adult-onset"" diabetes.Writing for Insulin Nation, Nicki Nichols explained why the older form of human insulin is difficult to control in children:When my child was first diagnosed, she was on NPH. It was incredibly difficult to limit a growing child's diet to such a strict schedule. Here's what it looked like:8 a.m.- 45-carb meal10:30 a.m. – 15-carb snack12 p.m. – 45-carb meal2 p.m. – 15-carb snack5 p.m. – 45-carb meal7:30 p.m. – 15-20 carb snack before bed to keep blood sugar up overnight.I cannot tell you how many times my child refused to eat the 45 carbs in her dinner. There is something wrong when you are fussing at your 5-year-old to stop eating her green beans and to eat her bread, or mashed potatoes, or pasta.The screen shot from the KDFW report no doubt went viral as a result of an ongoing controversy over the cost of analog insulin, which as of 7 February 2019 soared to a retail price of more than $300 per vial. Americans have been awash in medical horror stories such the death of Jesse Lutgen, a 32-year-old Type 1 diabetic who lost his job at a distribution center in Dubuque, Iowa, and with it, his health insurance. He was found dead in his home in February 2018, having run out of insulin. His last vials of the medication were given to him by a friend.",https://t.co/wAerH5IN1S,others
A book about type 1 diabetes (Learning to Live with Diabetes for Children): Yerachmiel B Altman: 9781799081395: Amazon.com: Books,"As an adult endocrinologist, and a person living with type 1 diabetes I have the unique opportunity to learn what people living with type 1 diabetes need to succeed. They need an empathetic ear,patience, knowledge, and the ability to see the lighter side of things. This book is one of the first I've seen to address all of these essential factors and more for a particularly vulnerable group of people with T1D, children. The book takes us through whimsical tale of a summer at a very special camp where children with T1D can go to not feel alone.Thankfully these camps do exist and are a boon to those able to attend. Yerachmiel Altman brings attention to these camps and normalizes in a fun,exciting way the experience to hopefully encourage children with T1D and their parents to think about these wonderful camps as an option. The rhymes in the book are playful but educational and more meaningful in the lessons conveyed than most textbooks. I encourage parents of children with T1D to read the book with their children so everyone can learn together. One of the most important things the book does is lets these children know they are not alone, and I think everyone with type 1 diabetes could use that message. Jason Sloane MD, Endocrinologist Type 1 diabetic 33 years This book describes Type 1 Diabetes Camp in an exciting and fun way. It explains common activities, describes the joy of meeting other children with Type 1 Diabetes, and provides a story that is easy for the reader to understand. I've had Type 1 diabetes for 13 years and attended a summer camp as a child, I loved it so much, I now work there asa medical staff member. I think this book will benefit any child who is planning to attend a camp for the first time. Highly recommended! Hannah Hamlin,4th-year medical student This book was really neat to read because it is just like the real thing. Camp is my favorite time of the year and I am so lucky that I can go back every year.Reading this book, ""I Can Go To Summer Camp"" by Yerachmiel Altman, has made me even more excited for diabetes camp this year. My favorite part of camp is the Dutch Auction like they play in the book, I know that this and other games they play in this book are just as fun as what we do at Camp Kno Koma Ben Gilmore age 12 Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 13 months""I Can Go To Summer Camp"" is another amazing book by Yerachmiel Altman. I've had Diabetes for 44 years and learned so much at Camp Kno Koma in WV. These campsare so important to children with diabetes. Being around other kids who are""just like me"" gives them a sense of being normal. At the same time it's an important learning experience. For kids who may be afraid to be away from home, this book can help get rid of the fears they have. I can't wait to add this book to my collection by Mr Altman. They go with me to camp where I now volunteer. The kids love them! These books are a must have for every parent with a diabetic child. Cheirie Hardy; Surviving &amp; living withdiabetes for 44 years and counting!There are many great tips in this bookportrayed across and easy for kids of all ages to understand. An example ofthis is to test regularly, take supply and have fun, it shows how fun beingindependent is. The group of kids share their differences,such as using pumps, injections, blood sugar meters and cgms. Each one similar,inspirational to see and learn about. This book encourages this. This book allows and makes kids aware rulesneed to be followed like everyone else, diabetic or not, bed time rules stillapply. This book portrays that you can eatwhatever you wish and have good results if calculations are done correctly.This book shows many ways to be aware ofyourself and when unwell the rules of the diabetic may be different. This book reflects of different activitiesand how different sports may impact blood glucose levels. It's widening theunderstanding and importance of regular testing no matter what you are doing. It shows responsibly is exciting! It gives a sense of hope that diabetes canbe controlled, not matter on what plans you have. It makes me feel lotsof gratitude, that I'm thankful that my condition (with some work) can beperfect. Amber Macleod, Camper as a child, Type 1diabetic 7 years",https://t.co/pDTdaEjI6e,others
Organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos intake promotes obesity and insulin resistance through impacting gut and gut microbiota,"Increasing evidence has shown that the use of global pesticides has increased the risk of developing obesity and T2D [34, 35]; however, the mechanisms are not well understood, and to the best of our knowledge, no report has focused on the mechanisms underlying the effects of pesticides on the gut microbiota and obesity. Gut microbiota, which consists of a large number of bacteria (10-fold more than the total number of human cells), shapes many important physiological and metabolic processes in the body [36, 37]. The gut microbiota in the human body is not simply a parasite, but rather engages in a symbiotic relationship. In addition to absorbing nutrients in food residues in the host gut, intestinal bacteria can provide bioactive substances and has important effects on the host in various pathophysiological aspects including immunity, body condition, and body weight [38, 39]. Therefore, pesticide-induced obesity may occur through its effects on the gut microbiota [40]. Here, we report for the first time that the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos may increase LPS levels in the body by enhancing intestinal permeability to induce chronic inflammation, and ultimately leading to IR and obesity. And the chlorpyrifos-altered microbiota could affect the occurrence of obesity and impaired glucose homeostasis.It has been well documented that both genetic and dietary factors have significant impacts on obesity. To comprehensively study the effects of chlorpyrifos on individuals with different genetic background and dietary habits, two dietary patterns (high fat and normal fat) and two strains of mice (C57Bl/6 and CD-1 (ICR)) were chosen to determine the pathogenesis and consequences of chlorpyrifos-induced obesity. The results showed that a HFD had significant effects on body composition and IR in both C57Bl/6 and CD-1 (ICR) mice, which are consistent with previous studies [7]. Chlorpyrifos had significant effects on body weight and percent of body weight change in mice fed a NFD, but not in those fed a HFD, suggesting that the influence of chlorpyrifos on body weight is related to dietary habits. The results from measuring absolute epididymal weight and epididymal fat pad content of whole body weight (%) indicated that chlorpyrifos significantly increased them in the body, which were not related to dietary patterns or genetic background. Together, these data suggest that chlorpyrifos-induced weight gain was largely attributed to the increased fat weight. Because visceral fat is closely related to the complications of obesity, these results indicate that the harmful effects of chlorpyrifos may extend beyond weight gain. We found that chlorpyrifos treatment resulted in significant weight gain and obesity status in both C57Bl/6 and CD-1 (ICR) NFD-fed mice; however, in HFD-fed mice, although chlorpyrifos did not significantly affect weight gain relative to their control group, their fat mass was increased and the obesity-related symptoms worsened. This notion was supported by the results of the insulin sensitivity tests. Chlorpyrifos induced an increase in IR in NFD-fed mice, as well as in HFD-fed mice, even though weight gain was not significantly affected by chlorpyrifos. Insulin is a key hormone in the body that is responsible for regulating the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. IR causes reduced sensitivity to insulin action in the cells of fat, liver, and skeletal muscle so that normal levels of insulin fail to efficiently reduce blood glucose, leading to hyperglycemia. IR is believed to be a major factor in the pathogenic mechanism of metabolic syndrome and T2D development. While the generation of IR is still not completely understood, factors such as genetic background, diet, and low-grade inflammation are known to be involved. In this study, genetic background and diet were the control variables; therefore, chlorpyrifos-induced IR is more likely to be mediated by the low-grade inflammation pathway.LPS is an integral component of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, and chronic exposure to low-dose LPS can induce low-grade inflammation [41, 42]. A HFD could increase intestinal permeability and LPS, thereby leading to low-grade chronic systemic inflammation [13, 28]. In this study, HFD groups were found to have higher intestinal permeability, LPS concentration, and inflammation markers than NFD groups. A previous study using in vitro model based on an enterocyte cell line showed that chlorpyrifos can interfere with tight junctions, altering the barrier integrity and increasing intestinal permeability [26]. Based on these results, we speculate that chlorpyrifos impairs the integrity of intestinal cells to result in intestinal inflammation, which allows increased LPS entry into the body culminating in endotoxemia. This speculation was supported by the results that chlorpyrifos could reduce the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins in the ileum and colon, and further supported by the results in intestinal permeability and LPS assays. Next, the activity of MPO and the fecal lipocaline-2 level was determined, and the results showed that chlorpyrifos treatment caused higher MPO activity and fecal lipocaline-2 level in NFD-fed mice. Both MPO activity and fecal lipocaline-2 level were important indicators of gut inflammation. In addition, the results of inflammatory mediator expression (TNF-α, PAI-1, IL-1 β, and MCP-1) in the ileum and colon further confirmed that chlorpyrifos treatment could lead to gut inflammation in NFD mice. Previous studies have shown that gut inflammation is often associated with systemic low-grade inflammation [43]. The expression of LPS receptor TLR-4 and related inflammatory mediators in the liver and fat tissues and plasma proinflammatory cytokines concentrations were further determined and found that these mediators could be increased by chlorpyrifos treatment. In previous studies in human and animals, IR individuals are often found to have low-grade inflammation and increased levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, PAI-1, IL-1 β, and MCP-1 [44–46]. These inflammatory mediators can interfere with the insulin signaling pathway to cause IR. Together with our results, it can be suggested that chlorpyrifos may increase the entry of LPS into the body by promoting intestinal permeability to induce low-grade inflammation eventually leading to IR and obesity.Previous studies have shown that dietary pattern could significantly impact the gut microbiota composition [47]. In this study, HFD decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Firmicutes, which are typical HFD-induced change in gut microbiota and related to obesity [29, 48]. On the other hand, exogenous compounds that affect gut microbiota composition and alter composition can directly impact the host metabolism [10, 32, 49]. Thus, in this study, the effects of chlorpyrifos on the gut microbiota were investigated, and the results showed that the gut microbiota in mice fed HFD was not significantly affected by chlorpyrifos treatment. A possible explanation is that the gut microbiota can be affected by HFD dominantly [48, 50], compared with which the impact of chlorpyrifos was limited. Thus, it is conceivable to have observed that gut microbiota was not significantly altered by chlorpyrifos in HFD-fed mice. Many previous studies showed similar results that xenobiotics-altered microbiota could impact host's condition [10, 32, 51]. By comparing changes in the microbiota of NFD-fed C57Bl/6 and CD-1 (ICR) mice, the core microflora that could be affected by chlorpyrifos treatment were identified, and according to previous studies, this changed microbiota composition might be the reason for the results of microbiota transplantation. The core affected microflora including increased Proteobacteria phyla and decreased Bacteroidetes phyla. Of particular note, increased LPS-bearing Proteobacteria and decreased Bacteroidetes phyla are reportedly associated with obesity [52, 53]. In addition, in the analysis of individual bacteria species, we found 31 OTUs that were affected by chlorpyrifos.To investigate the effects of chlorpyrifos-altered microbiota, half of the mice in NCPF group were treated with antibiotics after 8-week chlorpyrifos treatment. The results showed that chlorpyrifos-led obesity and IR were completely restored by antibiotic treatment for 4 weeks, suggesting that gut bacteria were involved in chlorpyrifos-induced obesity and IR. In addition, the results of microbiota transplantation experiment using NCPF and NFD groups' microbiota showed that chlorpyrifos-altered microbiota could also induce obesity and IR, especially in NFD-fed C57Bl/6 mice. The above results suggested that chlorpyrifos-altered microbiota should be one of the reasons for the increased percent of fat weight and impaired insulin sensitivity in mice. Thus, chlorpyrifos not only has direct effects on the body, but also negatively impacts glucose homeostasis and obesity by altering gut microbiota composition.",https://t.co/yhiaEK9uot,others
Emergency Help Needed,"Emergency Help Needed $495 of $3,500 goal Raised by 7 people in 1 month This is a very shameful thing right now, but we need serious help with our bills.The funds to help us pay off and catch up all the bills have been taken from us.Our gas is: $391.57Our electricity is: $1310.13Our rent is: $645.40Our trash is: $150.00New water heater is: $700.00 (est.)Total $3179.10We had the ability to get everything caught up, we filed taxes and we're about to get just over $12,000 back. Then the state of Minnesota decided to decline my step daughter's health insurance, and backdated going all the way back to August 2018 which left us on the hook for well over the $12,000, of which they already took from us.Because the insurance was rejected, the state of Minnesota paid some of the bills that were owed and we have to pay the state back. That's how they Justified having the ability to take all our refund back and we cannot file an appeal to get that money.We still do not have hot water, so we can't even bathe!The only reasons we have gotten as far behind as we had has been because we never got fully caught up on our bills. And the money we did have had been spent on food and clothes for the kids. Scott County has treated us extremely unfairly. Now, We finally had the opportunity to get ahead and it was robbed from us.This is why serious help is needed. I have another GoFundMe account, but that is for my medical expenses, and all that money goes directly into an HSA (Health Savings Account) that I cannot touch until it is being used to pay for my medical expenses.I will post copies of the bills as I'm able to download them all. + Read More",https://t.co/hDAoTxegO4,others

Insulin allergy can be successfully managed by a systematic approach,"This study was conducted retrospectively and included data from the Allergy Centre database, ACbase, on patients seen at the Odense Research Center for Anaphylaxis (ORCA), Allergy Centre at Odense University Hospital from 2003 through March 2017 with suspicion of insulin allergy. Since 2010 the Allergy Centre in Odense has been the only place in Denmark to evaluate patients suspected of insulin allergy in collaboration with the Department of Endocrinology, Odense University Hospital.The examination comprised a comprehensive medical history (type of diabetes, duration and severity of symptoms, prior treatment etc.), measurement of specific IgE against human, bovine, and porcine insulin and—where appropriate—also ICT with different insulins.Specific IgE measurement (ImmunoCAP) against human, bovine and porcine insulin was performed by Thermo Fisher, Uppsala Sweden. Values above 0.35 kIU/L were considered positive.Intracutaneous tests were performed by injecting 20–50 µL of the different insulins in the concentration 5 IE/mL, and reactions were considered positive if the wheal size diameter was 3 mm larger than the initial bleb. ICTs were read after 20 min, according to guidelines from the European Network on Drug Allergy (ENDA) [13]. As controls, skin prick tests were performed with histamine 10 mg/mL (ALK-Abello, Denmark) as the positive control and isotonic NaCl as the negative control.The insulins available for the test varied over time, and some of the first patients seen (n = 3) were only tested with a selection of the available insulin types, based on the clinician's judgment. The majority, however, were tested with the full panel of insulins, which included rapid acting human insulin (Humulin Regular®, Insuman Rapid®, Actrapid®), rapid acting analogue insulin lispro (Humalog®), and insulin aspart (NovoRapid®), and intermediate acting isophane human insulin (Humulin NPH®, Insulatard®, both containing protamine), and long acting analogue insulin: Insulin glargine (Lantus®), and insulin detemir (Levemir®). Most recently, the following additions have been made to the panel: Toujeo®, Abasaglar® (both insulin glargine), Tresiba (insulin deglucec), NovoMix® (insulin aspart with added protamine), and Apidra® (insulin glulisine).SPT with insulin was initially a part of the examination but was abandoned due to the poor sensitivity and specificity of the test. Basophil histamine release (HR test) was performed in a few patients but not systematically. Consequently, the results of SPT and HR test are omitted.The patients—or in the case of children, their parents—gave informed consent to store their data in the ACbase. All data for this study were collected after approval from the Danish Data Protection Agency (17/11270).",https://t.co/3d8HIhOZn8,others
Blame-game weary House panel vows action on insulin prices,"Lawmakers told the three drugmakers that sell insulin in the U.S. and the middlemen companies that negotiate what insurers pay for those medicines that if they did not find a way to lower prices, Capitol Hill would do it for them. Executives from the insulin companies, Eli Lilly and Co., Novo Nordisk A/S and Sanofi, and the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s OptumRx and Cigna Corp.'s Express Scripts, all agreed the U.S. drug pricing system was broken. But members of the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee made it clear they were tired of hearing that excuse and wanted real solutions to soaring insulin prices, which have left some patients having to ration their medicine, often resulting in their illness worsening, with some even dying. ""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., told the drugmakers and PBM middlemen. The hearing was the second time this month the subcommittee had discussed the high costs of insulin. It had convened an earlier session on the matter on April 2, where the lawmakers heard from a panel of diabetes experts, advocates and patients. ""We have the names of people who have died because they couldn't get their insulin,"" Schakowsky said at the April 10 hearing. The Illinois lawmaker warned the companies they were ""in trouble"" and members of Congress — on both sides of the aisle — were committed to taking action. The House and the Senate both have ongoing bipartisan investigations into insulin prices and both chambers have convened hearings on the matter. The Senate Finance Committee had met just a day earlier to examine the overall problem of high U.S. drug prices, where the senators grilled executives from CVS, Cigna and OptumRx and two other PBMs. The Finance Committee had convened a hearing in February with executives from seven drug companies, though Sanofi was the only insulin maker to appear before that panel. 'Your days are numbered' The April 10 House hearing was the first time lawmakers had summoned insulin makers and PBMs to testify jointly on Capitol Hill. ""If you think you can just out talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" Schakowsky said. Hours before the hearing, Sanofi revealed it planned to offer its insulin products for $99 per month for up to 10 boxes, though not including its combination medicine. Weeks earlier, Lilly also said it would offer a generic version of its Humalog insulin at half the price the brand is listed. Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., however, rebuked the companies, noting those efforts had come after years of public outcry and only shortly before the drugmakers were to appear before Congress. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, suggested that if drugmakers and PBMs could not soon bring prices down significantly, the government should take over the situation and set the prices of prescription medicines. He noted that throughout the hearing, the biopharmaceutical companies had pointed the finger at the PBMs and the middlemen pointed right back at the drugmakers — going in circles blaming one another, much the same way the battle over prices has continued outside the walls of Congress. ""You keep saying the system, the system, the system doesn't work. Why doesn't this competitive market-based system work anymore? What has happened?"" Pallone asked. He pressed drugmakers on why they were blaming PBMs when the manufacturers in fact set and control the list prices of their medicines and have the power to bring them down. The drug companies, however, insisted that their list prices are driven by the rebates and discounts demanded by the PBMS, which determine placement on formularies — insurance companies' lists of covered medicines. Another Democrat, Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland, said that while the U.S. drug pricing system may have needed an intermediary in the beginning, ""now things have gotten out of control."" He suggested PBMs should be converted to a system like utilities or nonprofits, with the government having some control in their activities. Change is not optional Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., the only licensed pharmacist in Congress, said he remembered the days when he could order drugs for his community pharmacy directly from biopharmaceutical companies, without having to go through the middlemen. ""I have seen patients at the counter having to make a decision between buying medicine and between buying groceries,"" Carter said. ""I was the boots on the ground there and that's why I'm so passionate about it."" Carter said drugmakers and PBMs have accomplished something lawmakers have been unable to do his entire time in Congress: create bipartisanship. ""This is going to end,"" he said. ""I've seen what you've done."" Oversight Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said Congress was committed to taking action to change the ""smoke and mirror system"" of the way drugmakers and PBMs do business together, particularly with insulin prices. She said the subcommittee would work on solutions in a bipartisan manner with input from the companies and then bring the drugmakers and the PBMs back in July or September to talk about any progress they have made on fixing the situation. ""This is not optional and this is going to happen,"" DeGette vowed.",https://t.co/xSWgvhOXxY,others

It is about the time that you are not eating.31:24 Insulin inhibits lipolysis, stopping you from burning fat. 32:24 On a 7 day water only fast, your insulin falls and you switch from burning food to burning fat. 33:13 During fasting, as your insulin falls, you get a counter-regulatory hormone surge, increasing adrenaline, noradrenaline, growth hormone and cortisol. 33:53 There is a period of gluconeogenesis at around 24 hours into fasting. You will burn protein, not muscle. 35:40 If the old protein is never broken down, you cannot build new protein. 37:26 You get much better retention of lean mass with an intermittent fasting strategy over cutting calories. 38:24 Biggest Loser style diets sink metabolic rates. 42:15 Women can fast. Ghrelin is the hunger hormone. Women have higher ghrelin spikes.43:01 If you don't eat over 24 hours ghrelin spikes 3 times, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, then drops. Hunger does not continue to increase. 45:04 Cravings disappear with fasting and keto.49:38 You can eat high carb foods and keep low insulin. 51:09 Sugar is more fattening than other carbohydrates. 53:51 Natural foods have natural satiety mechanisms.01:08:31 Type 2 diabetes is misunderstood by doctors. 01:10:08 Blood glucose is a symptom of type 2 diabetes. We treat the symptom, not the disease. 01:12:15 Type 2 diabetes is reversible, except for the very late stage. 01:16:42 The longer you've been overweight the more it effects weight loss. 01:18:08 There are conflicts of interest in medicine.

A crusader for medical ethics, Godlee is known for blasting governments for being lax, taking on global pharma giants such as Roche and GlaxoSmithKline for reportedly hiding trial data, speaking fearlessly against corruption in science, and championing the cause of patient-centric healthcare. In India to attend the BMJ South Asia Awards 2016, Godlee talks to Economic Times on a wide range of issues, from air pollution to corruption in medicine and the work that the BMJ does in the country. Edited excerpts: How does it feel to breathe the most polluted air in India? (Laughs) I love this country. It's a wonderful place and am coming back here after two years. The air now looks a lot better from what I read and saw a few days back. To look at the positive side of things, air pollution is back on the agenda of the people. You have to make the public aware and the governments accountable for moving us away from burning fossil fuel. Your recent report reveals that most of the people with diabetes in India are largely dependent on foreign-made insulin, which is expensive… There are certain things which are not going right. To put patients on insulin is a big push by industry and the doctors who in turn are influenced by the industry. Rather than tackling the lifestyle issues, going straight to insulin is not the right option. That is a big worry because insulin is not without its harm and is expensive in India. I think it's a medical scam, an industry scam. Patients think that this is the best drug for them, and they need to pay for it or else they would die, and a very big group of people are vulnerable to it. I think we need to speak out against the pressure to put people on insulin. With diabetes becoming such an epidemic in India, we need to look at the root causes and put money there rather than putting people on insulin. Is there a parallel in terms of rising caesarean births in India rather than normal delivery? Caesarean births are a problem globally, and not just in India. It's more convenient for the doctor, who also gets paid more, and people are encouraged to think it's safer. In some cases, it may be true but not in all cases. It's not a riskfree procedure: anaesthetics, surgery, medical cost, long time of recovery and even more difficulty in having subsequent babies. It's a global issue. What's your take on corruption in medicine? Again, it is a global phenomenon, not just confined to India. There's corruption in medicine globally. But if you have a system where doctors are paid more to do more, then you are going to end up with a system which seems to reward that kind of behaviour. If so, then it's going to get much more likely that doctors would tend to push more for surgery, for investigations… kickbacks encourage more such behaviour. And, on the positive side, there are doctors in India who have started speaking against this. Consumer activism too is missing in India… That may be the case. Consumer activism is a huge potential benefit if we can harness it in a big way. We need to educate people that more is not better, more medicine can be worse. They need to ask questions, take second opinion, ask about the benefits of treatment. The same thing can be done regarding air pollution. Awareness has to be created. Hard questions need to be asked. There needs to be a cultural shift where doctors and patients are much like partners. You first came to India in the early 1990s. In terms of the medical ecosystem, what has changed in India since then? The biggest change is exceptional tertiary care, which even puts the rest of the world to shame. Many countries in the world would be surprised to see the kind of expertise that doctors have here. The second big change is highvolume, high-quality medical care, which is again startling. And what has failed to change? Lack of quality primary care is the biggest concern. With money and energy spent in tertiary medical care, it requires strong political intervention to create infrastructure for primary healthcare. You need to give incentives to young doctors and nurses to work in the primary healthcare system. The pressure that doctors work under has also not changed. Any other medical trend that you have noticed in India? The breakdown of the doctor-patient relationship is disturbing. There have been reports where doctors have been abused and assaulted. It is happening in China as well. There's an unrealistic expectation from medicines and doctors. But there are other issues as well. We are overpromising in terms of offering treatment. Then there are issues about patients taking loans to meet medical expenses. There have been reports of people selling assets and getting bankrupt. These are awful decisions that people have to make. Can drug price control make healthcare more affordable? The government in India has been doing something to bring price control in drug treatment. That's the issue right across the world where drugs are hugely overpriced. Drug companies, for their part, say that they have to recover research and development costs. Since the markup is huge, we need to incentivise drug companies to behave in a different way. The problem of drug pricing is more apparent in India because people are paying themselves.",https://t.co/KzKP8znjvK,others

The C1 microorganism, which enables the development and large-scale manufacture of low-cost proteins, has the potential to be further developed into a safe and efficient expression system that may help speed up the development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. Dyadic is using the C1 technology and other technologies to conduct research, development and commercial activities for the development and manufacturing of human and animal vaccines (such as virus like particles (VLPs) and antigens), monoclonal antibodies, Fab antibody fragments, Fc-Fusion proteins, biosimilars and/or biobetters, and other therapeutic proteins. Dyadic pursues research and development collaborations, licensing arrangements and other commercial opportunities with its partners and collaborators to leverage the value and benefits of these technologies for their potential use in the development and manufacture of human and animal biopharmaceuticals. In particular, as the aging population grows in developed and undeveloped countries, Dyadic believes the C1 technology may help bring biologic drugs to market faster, in greater volumes, at lower cost, and with new properties to drug developers and manufacturers and, hopefully, improve access and cost to patients and the healthcare system, but most importantly save lives.Please visit Dyadic's website at http://www.dyadic.com for additional information, including details regarding Dyadic's plans for its biopharmaceutical business.Dyadic trades on the OTCQX tier of the OTC marketplace.

Insurance Company Caps Insulin Copays at $25,"In case you missed the recent headlines: One of the largest insurance companies in the country has made a move to cap copays for insulin at $25 for a month's supply, attempting to broaden access to this life-sustaining medication that's become the poster child for outrageously high drug pricing in America.Share on PinterestAnnounced on April 2, the combined company of Cigna and Express Scripts -- which finalized a $67 billion merger at the end of 2018 -- plans to offer its members in participating plans a Patient Assurance Program that will cap out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, copays, co-insurance) for insulin at $25/month max. The new program will be finalized by year's end for Express Scripts members, and the start of 2020 for Cigna members.This comes at a time of increasing pressure over skyrocketing insulin prices in America, with multiple Congressional hearings underway -- including one today before the Senate Finance Committee with insurers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), and one tomorrow (4/10/19) involving the big three insulin makers being called to testify in front of a House panel. The current Insulin Pricing Crisis is a system-wide issue that has bubbled to the top of public consciousness, and is thankfully now being heatedly discussed at both the federal and state levels. While Cigna and Express Scripts' new $25 copay program is ""only a band-aid"" for certain people who have particular insurance plans that opt in, it is being called ""a step in the right direction"" by vocal advocates who recognize that it will help many people couldn't otherwise afford the insulin they need to survive.We reached out to Cigna/Express Scripts to answer the many questions that come to mind for PWDs (people with diabetes) like us: First off, how many PWDs actually stand to benefit from this?More than 700,000 people enrolled in commercially insured plans across Cigna and Express Scripts had filed a claim for insulin in 2018. So that is the potential population for this program, Cigna says. Many news stories report that the average Cigna/ES member is only paying $41 a month for insulin prior to this program, which is already fairly affordable...?The devil's in the details, of course. Cigna states that for the average Cigna/Express Scripts member, the price of a 30-day supply of insulin is only $41.50, while for those on High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) it's $81/month, and up to $100/month for those on HDHPs in which insulin is not on the preventative drug list where deductibles don't apply.Those amounts may not sound exorbitant, but what they don't take into account is that early in the year, prior to meeting an annual deductible or coinsurance requirement, many people are exposed to high costs and thus unaffordable insulin. So while a copay may hit just $41.50/month at some point late in the year, the truth is that for many months before that happens, the cost is hundreds of dollars higher. So yes, Cigna has some feel-good numbers to share, but they are a bit misleading and don't reflect reality.Cigna says this new Patient Assurance Program will amount to members' annual costs dropping from $1,000 to $250 -- which is meaningful however you slice it. Wait, members will only have to pay $25 -- and not meet their deductible first?Yes, that's correct. For those higher deductible plans, this moves insulin to a ""preventative drug"" category in which the deductible wouldn't apply. Instead, the low copay is available immediately. What insulins are being offered through this program?All three big insulin manufacturers -- Lilly, Novo and Sanofi -- are participating, according to Cigna/ES. We're told they plan to include both short-acting and basal insulins, but a full product list isn't yet available. We were immediately concerned about ""preferred brand"" status that could lead to another ""formulary war"" where drug makers jockey to get better access and lower copays ahead of their competitors, but Cigna insists the program will not have an impact on formulary status. How much insulin do members get for that $25 copay?The cost is $25 for a month's worth of each patient's individual prescription of insulin, whatever amount that may be and whether it's in vials or pen cartridges. Share on Pinterest But what if my Cigna insurance plan requires me to get 90 days of insulin rather than a single month's worth?You will still benefit, Cigna says. The copay for a 90-day supply, whether via mail delivery or retail, will be $75. When does this program begin and end?The powers-that-be tell us they expect it will launch for Express Scripts members before the end of this year, and for Cigna members beginning in 2020. This is not a pilot or trial program, and there's no end-date attached at this time. Why not just lower list prices for all insulins offered through Cigna?That's a separate issue, we're told (and given the convoluted nature of drug pricing including industry rebates and kickbacks, we're not surprised). So how is this being paid for?We wondered whether Cigna Corp. was absorbing the overhead costs. As it turns out, the participating drug makers (Lilly, Novo and Sanofi) are all providing an additional discount applied at the point of sale to push the copay down to $25. Sadly, this doesn't eliminate the issue of established rebates in broader insulin pricing, we're told. How do I know if my employer has signed up to participate in this?""We are not able to just automatically apply it to our clients,"" a Cigna spokeswoman said. ""They have to agree to participate because it's their benefit. We are going to encourage all clients to implement this as a program, and feel confident most will be eager to implement it."" There is no charge to participate, and Cigna assures us that ""most plans"" will not see any additional cost to get the co-payment down to $25 for the patient. Employers interested in participating can learn more about during open enrollment periods (annual insurance discussions when plan designs are evaluated), and are welcome to contact Cigna/ES to find out more. What about Medicare and Medicaid? And those without insurance, or who aren't covered by Cigna plans?To clarify: Sorry Folks, this will not apply to those on federal plans. It's a program specifically offered by Cigna and Express Scripts for their members. Will other insurance companies follow suit?We certainly hope so. When asked for a comment on that, a Cigna spokesperson provided this statement: ""Our job is to provide better care, more choice, and greater affordability. Our Patient Assurance Program offers all three. For customers and members who rely on insulin, Cigna and Express Scripts have found a way to deliver greater affordability and peace of mind to these patients, and we are confident that our new program will remove cost as a barrier for people in participating plans who need insulin. We're also glad the manufacturers are able to work with us to make it happen."" Why is this happening now?Good question. We wondered if it was a direct result of the new federal Health and Human Services (HHS) proposal to eliminate drug rebates... but Cigna says they have been working on this concept ""for a while"" and were finally able to make it materialize following the Cigna/ES merger finalization in December 2018. We still think it's pretty coincidental (and likely planned) that this move comes just as insurers and PBMs are being summoned before Congressional panels over drug and insulin pricing. Right. Isn't this just another PR move to take the heat off payors and other decision-makers on drug pricing?Some may roll their eyes, saying it's only a PR move -- but while there may be truth to that, it still helps.Just like the recently announced half-price Insulin Lispro from Eli Lilly, this is nowhere near a final solution to America's Insulin Pricing Crisis, of course. No one claims it is. But just like with that offer, if one more family can afford the insulin they desperately need, then it's a win for our Diabetes Community.The advocacy doesn't stop here, of course. We continue to cheer on the many insulin pricing advocacy initiatives and efforts to call manufacturers and PBM middle-men to task. Here's to slowly but surely moving the needle on insulin access (no pun intended).",https://t.co/1dqvvMlCmR,others
Blockading Venezuela: The Linchpin of the US Strategy of Aggression,"Revealing examples are emerging of the cumulative impact that US sanctions against Venezuela are having on the Venezuelan people in the field of health, one of the key priorities of the Bolivarian revolution.In July 2017, the US bank Citibank refused to handle Venezuela's payment for the import of 300,000 insulin doses to meet the needs of 450,000 registered patients.Three months later, the US blockade prevented Venezuela from depositing funds with the UBS Swiss bank, delaying a purchase of vaccines for months and disrupting the country's vaccination schedules.In November 2017, transnational pharmaceutical companies Baster, Abbot and Pfizer refused to issue export certificates for cancer drugs, making it impossible for Venezuela to buy them.And in 2018, a $9 million payment through an international account for dialysis supplies for treating 15,000 patients, free of charge, was similarly blocked under threat of US sanctions.These illustrative examples and similar ones about the blocking of food imports put the lie to the US claim that it is concerned about the well-being of the Venezuelan people.It is clear that the US sanctions — illegal under international law — are part of an overall strategy to bring about what the US calls ""regime change.""Its aim is to undermine and topple the elected government of President Nicolas Maduro and secure control of Venezuela's vast oil reserves and other natural resources and wealth.In so doing it would reassert its domination over the region against the challenges to its control posed by an independent sovereign Venezuelan state committed to social justice and regional unity.US sanctions date from April 2016 following president Barack Obama's executive order a month earlier, permitting them on the bizarre grounds that Venezuela is a ""rare and extraordinary threat to US national security and foreign policy.""But in effect this move simply made overt what was previously an undisclosed strategy of ""regime change"" through destabilising Venezuela, dating back to the early years of Hugo Chavez's presidency.This had led George W Bush's administration to support the failed coup d'etat against Chavez in 2002 and the right-wing management lockout in the oil industry which caused billions of dollars of lost revenue and a catastrophic impact on the government's social projects.Declassified US government documents and WikiLeaks material have shown that the US subsequently used covert financial, political, media and diplomatic activities in pursuit of its goal.But with the repeated failure of US-financed efforts by Venezuela's right-wing opposition to overthrow the government, the US seems to have decided to take a much more central role in the strategy of ""regime change."" As part of this shift, the US has increased the use of unilateral illegal sanctions against Venezuela.Following President Donald Trump's renewal of the 2015 executive order declaring Venezuela a threat to US national security, further rounds of sanctions have been imposed against Venezuela in February 2017, May 2017, July 2017, August 2017, November 2017 and March 2018.The most recent sanctions were imposed the day after Venezuelans voted Maduro in for a second term in the May 20 election as what can only be seen as punishment for doing so.The effect of sanctions is far-reaching.They interfere with international trade, blocking access to medicines as the earlier cited examples show, but also food and other essential goods. They block financial transactions, both payments and remittances, freeze Venezuela's financial assets held externally and delay buying and selling operations, not only of the Venezuelan government and companies but also foreign business partners.Sanctions now form a key part of what is a strategic plan by the US to ruin the Venezuelan economy, pushing the population towards mass migration or internal civil conflict and thus creating the conditions for a so-called ""humanitarian intervention.""This strategy clearly replicates draws on both the longstanding US blockade of Cuba and its destabilising of Allende's Chile in the 1970s.Not only has the Trump administration levied four rounds of sanctions against Venezuela less than half way through its term but, in August 2017, Trump stated he would not ""rule out the military option"" against the country.Neighbouring Colombia's recent decision to join Nato also increases US military reach and capabilities, prompting the Venezuelan government to call it ""a serious threat to regional peace and stability.""The US has also been ramping up pressure on Venezuela by internationalising its campaign of aggression. A major effort to persuade other countries, by one means or another, to join in has led Canada, the EU, Panama and even Switzerland to apply sanctions.US courting of the so-called Lima Group of right-wing Latin American governments has further sought to isolate Venezuela diplomatically in the region.In these circumstances, the response must be to internationalise the support for the elected government of Venezuela and defend its right to sovereignty. Solidarity is needed more than ever.You can sign a petition against Trump's sanctions on Venezuela at vsc.eaction.org.uk/petition/notrumpsanctions.The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Venezuelanalysis editorial staff.",https://t.co/JLEBLVcmU9,others

A high-monounsaturated-fat/low-carbohydrate diet improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients,"A high-monounsaturated-fat/low-carbohydrate diet improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patientsA high-monounsaturated-fat/low-carbohydrate diet improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patientsParillo, M.; Rivellese, A.A.; Ciardullo, A.V.; Capaldo, B.; Giacco, A.; Genovese, S.; Riccardi, G.Metabolism Clinical &amp; Experimental 41(12): 1373-13781992It is commonly believed that high-carbohydrate (CHO) diets improve peripheral insulin sensitivity; however, this concept is based on anecdotal evidence. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients treated with insulin, a high-monounsaturated-fat (MUFA) diet is more effective than a high-complex-CHO diet in reducing blood glucose levels. The aim of our study was to compare the effect of a high-MUFA diet and a high-CHO diet on peripheral insulin sensitivity and metabolic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Ten non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients aged 52 +- 8 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 26.7 +- 3.5 kg/m-2 who were being treated with diet alone (n = 5) or with diet plus glibenclamide (n = 5) were randomly assigned to a 15-day period of either a high-MUFA/low-CHO diet (CHO, 40%; fat, 40%; protein, 20%; fiber, 24g) or a low-MUFA/high-CHO diet (CHO, 60%; fat, 20%; protein, 20%; fiber, 24g) and were then crossed-over to the other diet. Diets were similar in their content of monosaccharides, disaccharides, and saturated fats, and were administered to the patients in a metabolic ward. The dosage of hypoglycemic drugs was maintained at a constant level throughout the study. With the high-MUFA/low-CHO diet, a decrease in both postprandial glucose (8.76 +- 2.12 v 10.08 +- 2.76 mmol/L; P lt .05) and plasma insulin (195.0 +- 86.4 v 224.4 +- 75.6 pmol/L; P lt .02) levels was observed. Furthermore, fasting plasma triglyceride levels were reduced after the high-MUFA fat/low-CHO diet (1.16 +- 0.59 v 1.37 +- 0.59 mmol/L; P lt .01). Insulin-mediated glucose disposal, evaluated with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (470 pmol/L) clamp, was significantly higher with the high-MUFA/low-CHO diet (5.8 +- 2.1 v 4.6 +- 1.8 mg/kg/min; P = .02). This study demonstrates that a high-MUFA/low-CHO diet has clinical and metabolic benefits in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients.(PDF emailed within 0-6 h: $19.90)Accession: 002284030Download citation: RIS BibTeX TextPMID: 1461145DOI: 10.1016/0026-0495(92)90111-mCarbohydrate and lipid metabolism in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet vs a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids.

"Visiting Mexico, asking strangers: Diabetics scramble for costly insulin","Mike Lawson will never forget how he ended up in the hospital 12 years ago when he had to decide between making a $300 car payment or buying insulin. ""I made a stupid choice,"" said Lawson, an Oakland resident who has Type 1 diabetes. ""That month I chose to pay for my car payment and to ration insulin."" These days, the price of insulin skyrocketing, and he is stockpiling the drug. Through Twitter, Lawson recently connected with a stranger who said she had four leftover bottles after switching brands. The two exchanged messages and met near her San Francisco office. Letting insulin go to waste ""is almost like tossing gold,"" Lawson said. The price of three commonly used insulin products has increased substantially in recent years. From 2013 to 2019, the cost of NovoLog nearly doubled, going from $289 to $540 per carton, according to according to letters sent in February to drug manufacturers by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating insulin prices. Another common drug, Lantus, rose in price from $244 to $431, the committee said. (The drug's maker, Sanofi, says the numbers rose from $228 to $425 over that time period, but the amount paid to the company actually fell 25% after Sanofi paid rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.) A vial of Humalog, a third popular insulin drug, cost $35 in 2001 and by 2015 had risen to $234, according to the Senate committee. And so, worried about cost, diabetics such as Lawson are increasingly seeking new ways to get, give away or exchange insulin cheaply or for free. Some are using unofficial channels on the internet. Others are traveling to Mexico, where pharmacies sell some popular types of insulin for a fraction of their cost in the United States. Lawson, who now is able to get insulin for a moderate price through insurance even though he still seeks out extra, has also given away some of his insulin to local strangers in need, who find him through Twitter by searching hashtags like #T1D (Type 1 diabetes) and #insulin4all. For the roughly 1.5 million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, the amount of money patients spent on insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $240 to $475 a month, according to a January report from the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care data. And spending in 2017 continued to rise, experts said. ""The risk isn't only that people are being trapped in debt,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, tweeted last weekend. ""Americans have actually died from diabetic ketoacidosis because they had to ration or skip their doses. We need to rein in Big Pharma greed to save lives."" Many stories have emerged nationwide about people who, like Lawson, rationed or delayed buying insulin because they could not afford it, often leading to deadly and dangerous results. About 1 in 4 diabetes patients uses less insulin than prescribed because of costs, according to a 2018 Yale University study. ""It's not just anecdotal, this is relatively widespread,"" said the study co-author Dr. Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. ""There are lots of patients having difficulty affording their insulin."" But why is insulin, which is naturally produced by the pancreas and first discovered for medical use nearly a century ago, so expensive? The scientists who invented it in 1923 sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto for the purpose of making it accessible. But the way the drug is produced and delivered to the body has changed significantly since then. Insulin was initially isolated from animal pancreases, but today it is made by inserting the human insulin gene into bacteria, producing the insulin protein, and then purifying it. Insulin is derived from live organisms and put through a complex process to become a medicine — so it's hard for a competing drug company to make a generic version of it. A handful of drug manufacturers have essentially patented the processes for creating modern-day insulin products just enough to keep exclusive patents under their name, experts said. Only three drug companies sell insulin in the United States: Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk. ""Some of the insulins have dozens of patents on them even though the active ingredient patent has expired,"" said Jeannie Biniek, a health economist who co-wrote the Health Care Cost Institute report. ""There's a question of whether these additional patents are providing a justified return on the investment or, if at some point, they are just providing the company the opportunity to maintain a monopoly on the market."" And, as is the case with many prescription drugs, it's not clear how the ""list price"" of insulin — what a patient would have to pay out of pocket for it, if they do not have insurance — is determined because negotiations between drug companies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers about who pays what are considered proprietary. Drug companies say lowering the list price wouldn't necessarily lead to lower costs for consumers because part of the list price gets paid to pharmacy benefit managers. In recent weeks, amid growing pressure from Congress, the drug companies and some insurers have announced plans to make insulin more affordable. But they fall short of many consumers' expectations. Eli Lilly, which makes Humalog, announced in March it will offer a half-price version of the popular fast-acting insulin for $137 per vial, but has not said when it will be available. A Lilly spokesman said the company also offers a free hotline that consumers can call for information about out-of-pocket reductions at the pharmacy and clinics where donated insulin is available. In April, hours before Sanofi executives were set to testify before a congressional committee on rising insulin prices, the company announced it will sell its insulin products for a fixed price of $99 a month, for up to 10 vials or boxes of insulin pens, to patients paying with cash. Patients who have commercial health insurance are eligible for co-pay cards that may lower their out-of-pocket expenses, a Sanofi spokesman said. Last year, 246,000 people used the co-pay cards and paid nothing or $10 a month for their Sanofi insulin, he said. Sanofi also provides free insulin for low-income uninsured patients who make about $30,000 a year or less. Novo Nordisk has provided free insulin to tens of thousands of uninsured people with diabetes since 2003 and spends $200 million each year on co-pay assistance to patients with commercial health plans. ""We know how challenging it is for a growing number of Americans with diabetes to afford their medicines, including the ones we make,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesman said. ""As a company focused on improving the lives of people with diabetes, this is not acceptable."" Cigna and Express Scripts, which recently merged, announced that they would cap out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $25 a month for patients whose pharmacy plans are managed by Express Scripts. Up to 700,000 people who are on employer-sponsored plans are eligible to receive this benefit if their employer decides to opt in. ""I'm glad to see the mounting pressure and public outcry are having an impact in Lilly releasing this generic and Cigna capping spending, but that's not enough,"" said Lipska, of Yale. ""Those are Band-Aid solutions that don't resolve the underlying issue of very high prices for these insulins."" Indeed, the discount and savings programs aren't reaching everyone. Sabella Larkin of San Diego said she has had to buy insulin in Mexico three times — once in Tijuana and twice in Rosarito. The first time was several years ago, when she was a college student in Texas, while working full time at a tanning salon and struggling to pay her bills. Her insurance at the time wouldn't cover an insulin refill until a certain date, and she couldn't wait. One of her customers at the salon lent her $200 to buy an insulin pen. ""Two weeks later when I got paid, I tried to reimburse her and she said no,"" said Larkin, 28. ""Being in that situation, that's when I went to Mexico and happened to see the insulin I take. It was only $20. I literally cried."" Larkin said she has purchased both NovoLog and Lantus in Mexico for $20 to $25, for the same amount of insulin that would have cost her hundreds of dollars at U.S. pharmacies. ""It was life changing,"" she said. ""It was this added security across the border."" Catherine Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

PCOS and insulin resistance,"What is the connection between PCOS and insulin resistance? What are the three criteria for PCOS, and why do some women develop too much testosterone? And why do patients put on a low-carb diet for other reasons than infertility, have a higher pregnancy rate?In this presentation from the Low Carb Denver 2019 conference, Drs. Nadia Pateguana and Jason Fung talks about PCOS and insulin resistance.This is our #10 published presentation from the Low Carb Denver conference. We've previously posted the presentations by Gary Taubes, Dr. Andreas Eenfeldt, Dr. Sarah Hallberg, Dr. David Ludwig, Dr. Ben Bikman, Dr. Paul Mason, Dr. Priyanka Wali, Dr. Caryn Zinn and Dr. Eric Westman.Transcript of the preview aboveDr. Jason Fung: Everything here is really a disease of too much insulin. And this is the part that sort of logic just breaks down. Because in medical school you learn about all this stuff and it's like okay well if too much insulin causes everything that you see in PCOS, then what's the treatment? How about Clomid? Is like… Did you not pay attention here? Too much insulin was the problem. Why are you giving Clomid which stimulates the ovary to ovulate? It's like… how about an ovarian wedge resection? It's like… What? What are you talking about? So ovarian wedge resection was this sort of old-time treatment for PCOS where they'd actually slice a little wedge, you know, like a little piece of watermelon out of your ovary and that was the treatment for PCOS. And why did it work? Because if you slice a little wedge of your ovary, your ovary cannot produce as much of the testosterone. So a lot of the symptoms would get better but, again, you're not making the actual disease better. Because you never actually treated the hyperinsulinemia. Or you can go to other treatments like… Metformin sort of makes little sense… But how about birth control pills? Is like, is that going to reduce your insulin? If it doesn't, then what are you doing for this disease?Like you got to go back to the root cause of the disease and fix it if you want to fix this disease. And the disease is so common and causes so much heart ache that– We treat it in this crazy manner when we already know what the root cause of this disease is. It's like it's too much insulin, so let's produce insulin.TranscriptWatch a part of our presentation above.

Dose-Dependent Modulatory Effects of Insulin on Glucose-Induced Endothelial Senescence In Vitro and In Vivo: A Relationship between Telomeres and Nitric Oxide | Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,"AbstractThe elderly are prone to postprandial hyperglycemia that increases their cardiovascular risk. Although insulin therapy is necessary to treat diabetes, high plasma concentrations of insulin may cause the development of atherosclerosis and accelerate endothelial senescence. We assumed that high glucose causes stress-induced premature senescence and replicative senescence and examined the regulatory role of insulin in endothelial senescence and functions under different glucose conditions. Exposure of human endothelial cells to high glucose (22 mM) for 3 days increased senescence-associated-β-galactosidase activity, a senescence marker, and decreased telomerase activity, a replicative senescence marker. Physiological concentrations of insulin preserved telomere length and delayed endothelial senescence under high-glucose conditions. The effect of insulin under high-glucose conditions was associated with reduced reactive oxygen species and increased nitric oxide (NO). Small interfering RNA targeting endothelial NO synthase reduced the antisenescence effects of insulin. Physiological concentrations of insulin also reversed high glucose-induced increases in p53 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and decreases in senescence marker protein-30. On the other hand, when insulin was given at any concentrations under normal glucose or at high concentrations under high glucose, its ability to promote cellular senescence was unrelated to endothelial NO. Finally, streptozotocin-induced diabetes showed more senescent cells in the aortic endothelium of aged rats compared with age-matched control and insulin-treated animals. Conclusively, the regulatory effects of insulin on endothelial senescence were modulated by the glucose environment. These data may help explain insulin's complicated roles in atherosclerosis in the elderly.FootnotesThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [Grant 195910403].Article, publication date, and citation information can be found at http://jpet.aspetjournals.org.doi:10.1124/jpet.110.177584.ABBREVIATIONS:ROSreactive oxygen speciesNOnitric oxideNOSNO synthaseeNOSendothelial NOSIGFinsulin-like growth factorPI3-Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasel-Argl-argininel-NAMENG-nitro-l-arginine methyl esterAICAR5′-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleosideLY2940022-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-oneHUVEChuman umbilical venous endothelial cellHAEChuman aortic endothelial cellSA-β-galsenescence-associated-β-galactosidaseNOxnitrite and nitratesiRNAsmall interfering RNAVCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1STZstreptozotocinSMP30senescence marker protein-30CM-H2DCFDA5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl esterVEvascular endothelialNGnormal glucoseHGhigh glucoseEHGextremely high glucose.Received November 24, 2010.Accepted February 23, 2011.Copyright © 2011 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics",https://t.co/bkUA7u2cl7,others
Drugmakers stockpile insulin as specter of no-deal Brexit drives up costs,"The U.K.'s largest drugmakers, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and AstraZeneca PLC are leading the industry's preparations for a so-called ""no deal"" Brexit — an increasingly likely outcome whereby the U.K. exits the EU without a withdrawal deal in place — by stockpiling medicines and spending a minimum of £120 million to secure supplies. Brentford, England-based GSK said it has set aside £70 million to implement changes required for Brexit and has increased inventory in the U.K. and in Europe, without disclosing specific levels in a move mirrored by other large suppliers of medicines in Britain including Novo Nordisk A/S and Sanofi. Denmark's Novo Nordisk, the biggest supplier of insulin for type 1 diabetes in the U.K., said it is now stocking 16 weeks of insulin, a medicine which helps to control blood sugar levels and has to be taken daily by people with the condition. Sanofi, France's biggest pharmaceutical company, has expanded its inventory of drugs to 14 weeks of ready supply versus 10 weeks prior to Brexit. With 45 million packs of medicines moving from the U.K. to the EU every month and 37 million packs entering Britain from Europe, the U.K. BioIndustry Association said Brexit poses significant risks to all involved in the life sciences sector. ""A 'no deal' Brexit would mean the biggest disintegration of the complex regulated medicines market across Europe in terms of regulation, cross-border movement of goods, comparative pricing and intellectual property,"" said Steve Bates, CEO of the BioIndustry Association. ""The life sciences sector knows that it is patients who are at the end of their supply chains,"" Bates said, adding that the industry has been preparing for Brexit for two years. Cambridge, England-based AstraZeneca said it has spent between £40 million and £50 million on increasing stock as well as coordinating changes to licenses and to thousands of packaging materials. The Anglo-Swedish drugs group also said it has duplicated batch testing release, which is the process of confirming every batch of medicine has the correct composition through laboratory tests, in Sweden. The company has also taken steps to safeguard against short-term border friction. Patient safety in focus ""Our focus is on safeguarding access and supply of medicines to patients,"" CFO Marc Dunoyer told reporters at the group's annual results press conference. ""The U.K. government has confirmed it will accept EU tested medicines in the event of a no-deal."" In a letter to pharmaceutical companies on Dec. 7, 2018, U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock reminded the pharmaceutical industry that an additional six weeks of medical supplies should be allowed for on top of existing stocks. He said that the government was working to ensure that there is sufficient roll-on, roll-off freight capacity to enable medicines to continue to move freely into the U.K. ""The government has also agreed that medicines and medical products will be prioritized on these alternative routes to ensure that the flow of all these products will continue unimpeded after 29 March 2019,"" Hancock wrote. In its annual report, GSK made an additional cost proviso of £50 million a year due to Brexit, citing subsequent customs duties and duplicate testing of its products. The company cautioned that this estimate could rise or fall depending on the emergence of further details of how businesses will need to change. ""Obviously right now is a period that's pretty difficult and rather uncertain, and we would all like to get to certainty as soon as possible,"" CEO Emma Walmsley said on a conference call with reporters Dec. 19, 2018. ""For GSK, what we are focused on in terms of Brexit, whatever the scenario may be, is securing the supply of the vaccines and medicines and consumer products that people need."" ""We have been working on that for some time with the government and we are very confident we can be ready in all scenarios for that,"" she said.",https://t.co/XjTIDHB0FT,others

Added sugars drive coronary heart disease via insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia: a new paradigm,"'I know of no single acceptable study that shows a high intake of sugar in a population that is almost entirely free from heart disease.'1—John YudkinCoronary heart disease (CHD) is responsible for one in every six deaths in the USA,2 and it eventually manifests as an acute myocardial infarction (MI). In the USA, almost 1 million acute MIs occur each year2 with approximately 15% of patients dying as a result of their acute event.2 If one manages to survive an acute MI, depending on the age of onset, the average survival time ranges anywhere from just 3.2 years to up to 17 years.2 Thus, CHD and acute MI are leading causes of early mortality in the USA.2Asymptomatic hyperglycaemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CHD, as well as death from CHD.3 Hyperglycaemia can develop during an acute MI, even in patients without diabetes,3 which may be caused by an increase in catecholamines, a reduction in the release of insulin, development of insulin resistance and increases in cortisol and growth hormone.3–5 However, many patients with MI already have diabetes and simply have yet to be diagnosed (ie, latent diabetes), where the acute stress worsens their diabetic state leading to hyperglycaemia.3 Indeed, one study showed that 73% of patients presenting with an acute MI have abnormal glucose tolerance, with 50% having diabetes.6 After 6 months, 43% still had abnormal glucose tolerance, which is approximately threefold higher than that found in matched controls (15%), the difference between the two being significant.6 Thus, hyperglycaemia does not seem to be an acute or temporary finding in patients who have experienced an MI, with many of these patients having continued abnormal glucose tolerance even when followed for several years after their event.The Whitehall study, a prospective cohort study encompassing 18 403 patients, showed that blood glucose after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was related to the age-adjusted CHD mortality after 7.5 years.7 In non-diabetics, a 2-hour blood glucose at 96 mg/dL or higher was associated with a twofold increased risk of CHD mortality.7 An elevated insulin response to an oral glucose load has been found in patients with atherosclerosis of the peripheral, cerebral and coronary arteries.8 9 In the Busselton, Australia study, insulin levels 1 hour after ingesting a 50 g oral glucose load were significantly related to the 6-year CVD incidence and 12-year CVD mortality in men aged 60 and older.10 In both the Helsinki policeman study11 and the Paris civil servant study,12 insulin levels taken in the fasting state after an oral glucose load (75 or 90 g) were associated with the occurrence of MI and CHD death 5 years later in men aged 30–59. However, the insulin:glucose ratio had the closest association with CVD. In all three studies, the relationship of insulin with CVD was independent of other covariates, including lipids, blood pressure and blood sugar.13 Considering that refined sugar, even when compared with starch, has been found to raise serum insulin levels,14 15 this provides compelling evidence that overconsuming added sugars (sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup) may lead to an increased risk of CHD through raised insulin levels.The evidence incriminating insulin and carbohydrate in atherogenesis is strong, and that this scheme would link atherosclerosis with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipaemia, lack of physical exercise, and, possibly, hypertension.16 (Stout and Vallance-Owen)It has been known for over 50 years that people with hypercholesterolaemia and hyperlipaemia generally have abnormal carbohydrate metabolism, with an elevated insulin level often driving their hyperlipidaemia.17 Indeed, insulin has been found to increase lipogenesis18 and stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation.19–21 Hyperinsulinaemia is also an independent risk factor for CHD,10 11 and insulin resistance predicts future cardiovascular risk.22 23 Increased levels of insulin are found in multiple disease states, including obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and those with hypertriglyceridaemia.24 Thus, any dietary factor that worsens glucose tolerance or promotes insulin resistance will also likely increase the risk of acute MI, CHD and CHD mortality. Considering that a diet high in added sugars (particularly the fructose component) leads to insulin resistance,25–28 the overconsumption of added sugars is undoubtedly a contributing factor to CHD and CVD mortality. Indeed, compared with a diet that contains less than 10% of calories from added sugars, a diet containing 25% or more calories from added sugars nearly triples the risk for CVD mortality.29Data from animal and human studies have noted that the isocaloric replacement of starch, glucose or a combination of both, with sucrose or fructose, increases fasting insulin levels,14 15 reduces insulin sensitivity,25–27 increases fasting glucose concentrations,30 increases glucose and insulin responses to a sucrose load14 15 and reduces cellular insulin binding.25 In other words, calorie for calorie, consuming added sugars is more harmful than starch or glucose regarding worsening of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Additionally, feeding rats sucrose leads to impaired glucose tolerance31 and adipose tissue that is less sensitive to the effects of insulin.32 33 Thus, data from animals and humans indicate that overconsuming added sugars drives insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia.During an acute MI, the heart switches from primarily using fatty acids as energy to using glucose. As insulin facilitates glucose uptake into cells, patients with insulin resistance during an acute MI will have a worse prognosis. Indeed, the degree of insulin resistance is related to the severity of an MI,34 and after an MI diabetics are more likely to die compared with non-diabetics.35 A diet high in added sugars promotes insulin resistance and diabetes,14 15 28 36 37 and thus may lead to larger MIs and increase the risk of CHD mortality.It is well known that those with diabetes have a higher risk of mortality and MI versus those without diabetes,38 which is independent of smoking status, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and body fat distribution. Additionally, patients diagnosed as being newly diabetic also have an increased risk of MI. Diabetics also have more coronary atherosclerosis than non-diabetics,39 40 particularly a higher frequency of severe narrowing of the left main coronary artery and healed transmural ventricular scars.41 The Framingham study showed that those with diabetes have an approximate threefold increased risk of dying from CVD versus the general population as well as an increased risk of stroke, CHD and peripheral arterial disease.42 Higher blood pressure or higher lipoproteins did not account entirely for the increased incidence of CHD among diabetics.13A diet high in added sugars has been shown to increase the prevalence of diabetes, whereas a lower intake has the opposite effect.43–46 Thus, added sugars promote an increased risk of CHD by increasing the risk of diabetes, which has been shown in both ecological analyses as well as clinical trial data. Considering that added sugars also promote insulin resistance, and those who experience an acute MI are more likely to be insulin resistant, the overconsumption of added sugars drives CHD.25 27A raised cholesterol level is not the only risk factor in those with CHD. Indeed, many other abnormalities commonly occur such as elevated glucose, insulin, triglycerides, uric acid and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.47 Additionally, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and altered platelet function are commonly found in patients with CHD or those with risk factors for CHD.48–51 All of these CHD abnormalities are induced or worsened in humans and animals when given a diet high in sugar,52–55 which can be reversed when reverting back to a diet low in sugar.14 55 This provides compelling evidence that the overconsumption of added sugars is a principal driver of CHD.Administration of a diet high in sugar for just a few weeks leads to approximately one-third of men experiencing numerous changes seen in CHD and peripheral vascular disease.53 54 These suggest that the overconsumption of sugar and the subsequent insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinaemia drive CHD as well as other diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and gout.56 57 Interestingly, smoking, which is a risk factor for heart disease, has been found to induce hyperinsulinism,58 suggesting that both the overconsumption of added sugars and smoking predispose to heart disease in a similar manner (via hyperinsulinaemia; although both also induce inflammation, oxidative stress and increased platelet adhesiveness).59–61Over the past 200 years, the average intake of added sugars has increased from 4 to 120 lb/year.62 Sugar is even more rewarding than cocaine in animal studies, and in humans added sugar is arguably the most widely consumed addictive substance around the world.63 The fact that diabetics have an increased risk of occlusive arterial disease,24 and that non-diabetic patients with vascular disease have raised insulin levels,24 suggests that insulin resistance is at the centre of heart disease. Considering a diet high in added sugars can induce insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia in humans, and a reduction in added sugars can improve these metabolic derangements, there is compelling evidence that the overconsumption of added sugars (high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose) is a principal driver of CHD. Indeed, refined sugar, as compared with fat, starch, glucose, or a combination of starch and glucose, promotes greater detriments on glucose and insulin levels in humans.14 15 28 36 37Currently, the main dietary culprit thought to lead to CHD is saturated fat. However, the overconsumption of added sugars (sucrose or table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) has also been associated with an increased risk of CVD and mortality from cardiovascular causes. A diet high in added sugars for just a few weeks has been found to produce numerous abnormalities found in patients with CHD including elevated insulin levels and insulin resistance. More importantly, a diet low in added sugars and refined carbohydrates has been found to reverse all of these metabolic defects. The evidence indicates that added sugars are a likely dietary culprit leading to CHD.",https://t.co/ctwgx3AFxP,others
Flora and pharma: A better landscape on prescription drug costs begins to bloom,"See more of the story The insulin I require to stay alive — or at least to keep my limbs attached, my kidneys pumping and my eyesight intact — last year cost more than $30,000. To quote our self-pitying president, ""Poor me."" Why should you care? Because a more apt sentiment would be, ""Poor you."" As a Medicare patient, I paid about 11 percent of that cost out of pocket. The drug companies that make the two insulins I inject (a tip of the hat to our dear friends at Eli Lilly and Sanofi) graciously absorbed about 11 percent of the sticker price. That leaves you, the hapless souls still paying Medicare taxes every week, picking up the majority of the tab: more than $25,000. I feel sick about it. You should, too. But this isn't a story about Medicare, insurance for the old and disabled, or Medicaid, a plan for the poor, though both programs threaten to buckle in the face of rising costs. The relentless rise of drug prices affects everyone, including workers covered by employer-sponsored health plans. For the sick and uninsured, meanwhile, drug prices often prove calamitous. Tales of Americans skipping doses of prescription drugs in the face of unaffordable prices have become commonplace, especially among the uninsured. Pharmaceutical ""coupons"" to reduce the financial pain — and public pressure to curb prices — look like Band-Aids on war wounds. The list prices for some drugs go as high as $800,000 a year. Costs of tens of thousands a year are far from exceptional. Even the deepest of discounts don't stop the bleeding. In their defense, drugmakers contend that bringing a new drug to market costs an average of $2.6 billion — money that must be recouped in the price. Yet the federal government contributes plenty to drugmaker research and development: about $100 billion from 2010 to 2016, according to the Center for Integration of Science and Industry Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs — spending more than $1,000 a year, per capita, compared with $686 in Germany, $669 in Canada, $497 in Great Britain, $401 in Norway and $351 in Sweden. The Commonwealth Fund, the health care research think tank that gathered those numbers, suggested the discrepancies are worse than they sound. ""Americans are more likely than their counterparts to bear this financial burden out-of-pocket — both because the U.S. is the only country among those studied with a large uninsured population, and because even Americans with insurance tend to have less protective benefits than people in other countries,"" the Commonwealth Fund said in a 2017 study. ""… it is not like Americans are overly reliant on prescriptions drugs as compared to their European counterparts,"" said a report by ""The Conversation,"" a health care newsletter. ""Americans use fewer prescription drugs and when they use them, they are more likely to use cheaper generic versions. Instead the discrepancy can be traced back to the issue plaguing the entirety of the U.S. health care system: prices."" Not coincidentally, Big Pharma has emerged as one of the biggest contributors to congressional campaigns — spending tens of millions of dollars to keep politicians in line. Lobbyists counted drug companies among their top clients, with nearly $28 million spent by the Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Manufacturers of America alone last year. Pfizer and Amgen each spent more than $11 million, according to the Open Secrets Center for Responsive politics. During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump called for Medicare to use its buying power on behalf of 60 million seniors to negotiate prices with drug companies. Consumer advocates have long championed the idea, noting that the governments of other industrialized powers follow a similar strategy — to great result. When Medicare ""Part D"" introduced drug coverage during the presidency of George W. Bush, drug lobbyists successfully barred plan directors from negotiating pharmaceutical prices. But Trump would be different, he vowed. Not for long. After meeting with Big Pharma executives shortly after he took office, Trump surrendered. He wouldn't push for Medicare drug price negotiations, after all. Instead, Trump recently proposed imposing ""transparency"" on drugmakers, forcing them to include prices in their TV commercials. The idea, which drug lobbyists are fighting, would apply only to a relative handful of drugs promoted on broadcasts and probably would do little to inflame patients who expect their insurance to cover most of the bills. In the meantime, as if to show his heart was in the wrong place, Trump named Alex M. Azar II as secretary of Health and Human Services. During his tenure as a top executive at Lilly, the company nearly tripled the price of insulin. Azar lately has portrayed the president — and himself — as backers of lower drug prices. He cites, among other things, the Food and Drug Administration approving more low-cost generic alternatives to prescription drugs. ""… the definition of success for Americans and for President Trump will be lower list prices — not flat net prices or smaller and fewer list price increases,"" he wrote in a recent commentary. Of course, if Big Pharma execs make another field trip to the White House, that promise may be medicine they don't have to swallow. Like the first flowers of spring, hopeful signs have started to pop up on the local and national landscapes. The first hearing of the new Democratic majority in the U.S. House focused on drug prices. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, running for president, sponsored a bipartisan bill to bar makers of name-brand drugs from making payoffs to rivals to discourage them from offering cheaper generic alternatives, a practice called ""pay-to-delay."" Klobuchar also would allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada. In the past, such measures have been blocked by political friends of Big Pharma, claiming no one will know if the imports are safe. As if Canadians are dropping in the streets from tainted elixirs. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another presidential hopeful, has proposed allowing the government to make generic alternatives when the industry fails to step forward. Minnesota has sued insulin makers, accusing them of deceptive practices in drug pricing. The action alleges that pharmaceutical benefits managers — the middlemen who decide what drugs employer insurance plans cover — profit from their choices. The drug companies, the suit says, raise their prices artificially high, then offer ""rebates"" pocketed by the middlemen. In effect, kickbacks that aren't shared with employers or patients. Sensing trouble, Lilly in March announced the rollout of a half-price generic alternative to its name-brand short-term insulin, Humalog. ""We don't want anyone to ration or skip doses of insulin due to affordability. And no one should pay the full Humalog retail price,"" Lilly chairman and CEO Dave Ricks said. The generic insulin will be priced at $137.35 per vial or $265.20 for a pack of five injection pens. Meanwhile, Lilly will continue to make Humalog and sell the name-brand drug to Medicare and private health insurers. If truly competitive generic insulin became available, we'd really have something to celebrate, according to a recent study in BMJ Global Health, a peer-reviewed medical journal. A 2018 study concluded that "" … robust competition in the human insulin and insulin analogue market would lead to sizable savings in most countries and that current manufacturers could set significantly lower prices while still making a profit."" The authors estimate insulin could be priced at $72 to $133. Not per month. Per year. That thought must make brand-name drugmakers frantic with anxiety. To which I say, ""Take a pill.""

Leave Dairy for the Cows,"If you chance to drive down some rural road you may see cows roaming and grazing. It looks quite pastoral and serene and you start to feel calm and then you see a calf or two, how sweet, the calf is drinking some milk. The calves don't need to graze on the tough grasses; they have the perfect food available.If milk is perfect for a calf, or a kid if one is inclined to drinking goats' milk, what makes us think that milk is a perfect food for us? For the most part, we turn to dairy in the hope that it will protect our bones and our strength. Milk and other dairy foods are sources of calcium and protein as well as the nutrients magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamins A, B12, D, and riboflavin. Cultured dairy products, yogurt and kefir for example, contain probiotics that can enhance the good bacteria in the digestive systems which kills Candida yeast and promotes digestion. Dairy Is Not as Protective As We ThinkMilk consumption has never been shown to reduce the occurrence of bone fractures. The Nurse's Health Study showed that dairy intake could increase the risk of fractures by 50 percent! As well, it appears to be vitamin D, and not calcium, supplementation that is more important in preventing bone fractures.Dairy plays a negative role in cancer development. Consumption of dairy products increases the levels of cancer promoter insulin-like growth factor-1 in the body. Dairy products and calcium supplementation may increase the risk of prostate cancer by up to 50 percent. On the other hand, calcium supplements, but not dairy products, may reduce the risk of colon cancer.The Nurse's Health Study determined that up to 75 percent of the world's population could be lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance is the inability to properly digest milk and dairy products; as we grow into late childhood and then adulthood we lose our ability to metabolize lactose, the sugar in milk. Some people have a severe intolerance and feel intense gastrointestinal distress while most may feel bloating, headaches, weight gain, and general malaise – symptoms easy to attribute to other causes. It is interesting to note that countries with low dairy and calcium consumption, such as those in Africa and Asia, also have low incidence of osteoporosis. Dairy is high in saturated fat and increases prevalence of heart disease and aggravates irritable bowel syndrome. Where Else Can We Get Calcium and Other Nutrients?Dark, leafy green vegetables should be called 'power houses'. They contain lots of calcium as other nutrients including folate, iron, and vitamins A, C, and K. Other good sources of calcium are tahini, sardines, and bone-in salmon.Strong bones require regular weight-bearing exercise that applies stress to your bones. What is the best thing you can do for your bones? Slip on your shoes and go for a brisk walk! If you prefer a gym environment try pilates, resistance weight-training, and yoga. Other ideas include dancing, hiking, golfing, jogging, tai-chi, and tennis.As stated earlier, current research suggests that vitamin D is more crucial to building strong bones than is calcium. If you don't live in a sunny clime, talk to your doctor about supplementing with 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily. Daily Scenarios Where Dairy Intake Can Be Reduced– Like a little coffee with your milk? Take your coffee black instead of your usual caffè latte or whipped concoction and start savouring the taste. Or, if you're not a coffee lover and drink it purely for the jolt, try it with unsweetened almond or rice milk instead. – Unsweetened almond or rice milk can also be used on your morning cereal in place of milk or yoghurt. Or, toss your cereal with berries or other fruit and start a new breakfast trend. If you have already begun to cut out processed foods and want to stop eating cereal for breakfast, try beans on toast for a filling breakfast, or steel-cut oats cooked in unsweetened almond, rice milk, or water with cinnamon. – As a cheese lover, I struggle to find a good alternative! There are plenty of non-dairy cheeses on the market; give them a try, and you may find one that suits your taste – however, please check the ingredient list as they can be full of preservatives and processed ingredients that do you no favours. If you are feeling brave, you can try making your own non-dairy cheese. Start 'Googling', find a recipe you like, and let me know about it! Milk and dairy foods are not formulated for adult consumption. Start reducing your intake today and feel the benefits! Work toward eliminating it completely. Your heart will thank you.

Can You Recognize Insulin Resistance in Children?,"The International Pediatric Association biennial meeting has long focused on the terrifying list of threats to child health: poverty, malnutrition, vaccine-preventable disease, toxic stress. But this year's meeting, held in Panama City, Panama, March 17-21, added a new agenda item: the paradoxical twin burden of undernutrition and obesity. A range of experts described the rising incidence of obesity, particularly as more countries have turned away, for myriad reasons, from locally sourced traditional foods to mass-produced, cheap, nutritionally poor yet calorically dense foods to feed their populations. This rise in overweight and obesity is underpinning a rise in insulin resistance. While historically a problem that does not manifest until adulthood, insulin resistance—and the resultant cascade effects of hyperglycemia, prediabetes, and, if unchecked, diabetes—heralds a lifetime of health risks for the affected child. Diva De León-Crutchlow, MD Diva De León-Crutchlow, MD, chief of the division of endocrinology and diabetes, and director of the Congenital Hyperinsulinism Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, presented the latest research on this topic at the conference and joined Medscape after her talk to summarize key messages. What is the incidence of insulin resistance in both the United States and internationally? While obesity is well recognized as a risk factor, what other factors increase risk? Can you ""tell by looking"" which children may have insulin resistance? We don't have a specific test to measure insulin resistance, so it's difficult to pin down hard-and-fast incidence numbers. But the studies that have followed obese or overweight children longitudinally indicate that a large percentage of those children will develop insulin resistance, particularly those with unfavorable fat distribution. The reality is that if you start with fat distribution in subcutaneous tissue, it is going to move to other tissues that impact insulin sensitivity, such as the liver. Normally this is a problem that occurs in adults, but increasingly it also occurs in children, and that is very highly associated with obesity. A rise in obesity is accompanied by a parallel rise in insulin resistance. One study[1] that followed healthy 6-year-olds found a prevalence in insulin resistance of over 25% in the children who were overweight or obese. However, I'm hesitant to cite some of those studies because there is not agreement on which measures should be used to assess insulin resistance in children. There are several specific risk factors that clinicians may not recognize. Infants born small for gestational age, especially those who then gain weight very rapidly early in childhood, are at particular risk, even if they are not obese during adolescence and later. Another group at risk are girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome and menstrual irregularities. The general practitioner, while addressing the menstrual irregularity, may not put that into the context of the whole metabolic profile. These girls often have insulin resistance and are at risk for type 2 diabetes. There is a genetic component that increases insulin resistance independent of weight. I don't think we completely understand what these genetic predispositions are, but it is important to ask about the frequency of type 2 diabetes in the child's family. The child of a mother with gestational diabetes is at higher risk for obesity and insulin resistance. You mentioned that there is not agreement on measures to assess insulin resistance. How can clinicians best identify these children? Rapid weight gain during the first year of life has been shown to be particularly important in predicting later adiposity, which correlates with insulin resistance. We're all so frustrated with the difficulty in successfully addressing overweight and obesity—particularly for children living in poverty, with more limited food options and environments that may not support vigorous outdoor play. Your practice is in an urban environment. Could you talk about some practical strategies that you have used? We tell parents to provide a high-fiber, low-sugar diet, but many people really don't know what that means. So in our one-to-one or group educational sessions, which are conducted by a nutritionist, we explain the different food groups and how to implement them in the diet. We teach people how to cook foods that are healthy and edible, too. Not all clinicians may have the ability to refer their kids to these kinds of educational interventions. In terms of physical activity, you're absolutely right that there are so many factors that are outside the control of the families and the medical community that affect a child's opportunity for physical activity. Schools are key. There are a lot of things that can be done inside the school that can be impactful, from the foods served to the opportunity to play. I frequently ask children if they like to dance. Most people like to dance, and that may be a perfect way of exercising inside the house or school, as well as doing it with friends. Are diet and exercise enough? Should pharmacotherapy be part of the strategy? If so, for which kids? The reality is that even in adult populations, there's no good evidence that metformin is indicated just for insulin resistance. I think that the approach to pharmacotherapy may change in the future as we realize that the results of nonpharmacologic interventions are not enough. But right now, with the evidence we have, there is not, in my opinion, a role for using pharmacotherapy in a child who doesn't have some comorbidity. What about surgery? We've been resistant to thinking about surgical intervention for obesity. But that's changing. We are realizing that surgery for an adolescent that is done by a multidisciplinary team that addresses all of the potential consequences and helps that family to support the needed lifestyle changes is an effective intervention. We're going to need more data outside the context of a research environment before we recommend this intervention for younger children. But for adolescents, it's becoming more and more of an option. Can surgery get teens off the insulin resistance slope? Can a child return to normal insulin sensitivity? The studies that have been done demonstrate that one can. The question is sustainability of the interventions that support a child in staying off that ramp. If the initial interventions that support a healthy lifestyle are sustained, that can permanently get that child off the track to insulin resistance and diabetes. We know that type 2 diabetes is a more severe disease in a young person than in a 60-year-old. Do you think the message that type 2 diabetes is a life-threatening condition in kids is getting out there? I have to say, probably not. I don't think it is recognized that it is a severe disease. There is a whole risk profile that accompanies type 2 diabetes in kids, including a very high risk for cardiovascular disease and complications we're used to seeing in adults that are now seen even at presentation in children. That is out of proportion to adult presentation of type 2 diabetes. I don't know that we understand why that is. Is the lack of recognition that diabetes is present—the long delay until diagnosis—the reason there is so much comorbidity at presentation? Or is the comorbidity a result of the severity of the disease itself? I think it's probably a combination. It is a more severe disease, and not only because it affects individuals for a longer time when it starts early, but because the disease itself is different, even within the same family. The parent may have developed diabetes at age 40 or 50 years of age, but the child develops diabetes at a younger age. It is likely a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors that determines the severity of the condition in children and adolescents. And while we're all learning to screen children earlier, not all kids see a healthcare provider annually. The lack of access to medical care, especially for vulnerable populations, affects how early the condition is recognized in a child and therefore how early intervention is sought. If we're going to effectively prevent this disease cascade, we really have to be looking at the whole cluster of risk factors in the children we are seeing for well-child visits. Thinking about how the child and family are eating, the opportunities for play, the family genetics, are all necessary. Early recognition of this profile and early intervention before the child even becomes overweight and insulin resistant are critical. As of now, we're not doing enough.

Skeletal muscle Nur77 and NOR1 insulin responsiveness is blunted in obesity and type 2 diabetes but improved after exercise training.,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are characterized by a blunted metabolic response to insulin, and strongly manifests in skeletal muscle insulin resistance. The orphan nuclear receptors, Nur77 and NOR1, regulate insulin-stimulated nutrient metabolism where Nur77 and NOR1 gene expression is increased with acute aerobic exercise and acute insulin stimulation. Whether Nur77 or NOR1 are associated with the insulin-sensitizing effects of chronic aerobic exercise training has yet to be elucidated. Fourteen lean healthy controls (LHC), 12 obese (OB), and 10 T2DM individuals (T2DM) underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with skeletal muscle biopsies. Muscle was analyzed for Nur77 and NOR1 gene and protein expression at basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, a subcohort of 18 participants (OB, n = 12; T2DM, n = 6) underwent a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention (85% HRmax , 60 min/day, 5 days/week). In response to insulin infusion, LHC increased protein expression of Nur77 (8.7 ± 3.2-fold) and NOR1 (3.6 ± 1.1-fold), whereas OB and T2DM remained unaffected. Clamp-derived glucose disposal rates correlated with Nur77 (r2 = 0.14) and NOR1 (r2 = 0.12) protein expression responses to insulin, whereas age (Nur77: r2 = 0.22; NOR1: r2 = 0.25) and BMI (Nur77: r2 = 0.22; NOR1: r2 = 0.42) showed inverse correlations, corroborating preclinical data. In the intervention cohort, exercise improved Nur77 protein expression in response to insulin (PRE: -1.2 ± 0.3%, POST: 6.2 ± 1.5%). Also, insulin treatment of primary human skeletal muscle cells increased Nur77 and NOR1 protein. These findings highlight the multifactorial nature of insulin resistance in human obesity and T2DM. Understanding the regulation of Nur77 and NOR1 in skeletal muscle and other insulin-sensitive tissues will create opportunities to advance therapies for T2DM.© 2019 The Authors.

Bloodletting Ameliorates Insulin Sensitivity and Secretion in Parallel to Reducing Liver Iron in Carriers of HFE Gene Mutations,"AbstractOBJECTIVE—To clarify the pathogenesis of diabetes associated with mutations of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, 17 carriers, 9 normal glucose tolerant (NGT) and 8 diabetic, were evaluated in an interventional trial.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—At enrollment and after a 2-year bloodletting period, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), liver histology (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score [NAS]), and liver iron content (LIC) were assessed.RESULTS—NGT subjects had significantly higher baseline insulin sensitivity (P ≤ 0.001), secretion, and insulinogenic index (calculated from the OGTT) (P ≤ 0.0001 for both) and lower LIC (P = 0.004) and NAS (P = 0.02) than diabetic patients. Baseline LIC correlated negatively with insulin secretion (NGT r0 = −0.676, P ≤ 0.0001; diabetes r0 = −0.589, P = 0.02) and insulin sensitivity (M value) (NGT r0 = −0.597, P = 0.009; diabetes r0 = −0.535, P = 0.03) and positively with NAS (diabetes r0 = 0.649, P = 0.007) and triglycerides (NGT r0 = 0.563, P = 0.015). At month 24, circulating iron was reduced by 179 ± 26% in NGT and 284 ± 54% in diabetic subjects. Insulin secretion (NGT 20 ± 4%; diabetes 33 ± 7%) and insulin sensitivity (NGT 25 ± 5%; diabetes 18 ± 3%) increased. LIC decreased in both groups (NGT 126 ± 42%; diabetes 61 ± 13%), and NAS ameliorated (NGT 65.1 ± 6.5 vs. 38.1 ± 6.83; P ≤ 0.0001; diabetes 2.1 ± 10.7 vs. 69.9 ± 10; P ≤ 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS—Iron depletion ameliorates insulin secretion and sensitivity in NGT and diabetic carriers of HFE gene mutations. This amelioration occurs in parallel with decreased LIC and improved NAS. These results justify glucose tolerance testing and prophylactic iron depletion in asymptomatic carriers as well.ALT, alanine aminotransferaseAST, aspartate aminotransferaseFFM, free fat massHH, type 1 hereditary hemochromatosisIGI, insulinogenic indexLIC, liver iron contentNAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseNAS, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scoreNGT, normal glucose tolerantNMR, nuclear magnetic resonanceOGTT, oral glucose tolerance testThe most common iron overload disorder in the general population is type 1 hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). The disease occurs in ∼5 per 1,000 Caucasian people of northern European descent (1). It is an autosomal recessive disorder mostly due to a homozygous mutation within the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene on chromosome 6, the Cys282Tyr mutation, or, less frequently, the His63Asp mutation. The clinical significance of heterozygosis for these mutations is still controversial (1).HH is associated with an increased rate of diabetes. Iron exerts a toxic effect on β-cells, which causes cell apoptosis and death (2,3). Iron depletion ameliorates β-cell function in patients with (4,5) and without iron overload (6,7). In HH, iron depletion has also been associated with the amelioration of insulin sensitivity in patients who have not developed diabetes (8). In liver, iron depot contributes to impaired insulin metabolism by reducing the insulin-extracting capacity (9), leading to hepatic insulin resistance (10).Increased insulin resistance favors the progression from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis and further increasing both peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance in a vicious cycle (11). In muscle, iron interferes with glucose uptake (2). Bloodletting enhances insulin sensitivity in healthy donors (4) and patients with iron-induced insulin resistance (12–14). Nonhomozygous HFE gene mutations are generally associated with a mild variant of hemochromatosis. When the disease is clinically evident, it is probably due to the occurrence of conditions such as the metabolic syndrome (12).Therefore, the pathogenesis of diabetes in homozygous or heterozygous carriers of HFE gene mutations remains poorly understood, with both decreased insulin secretion and sensitivity being potential contributing factors. Thus, to add new insight into the pathogenesis of this topic, we studied prospectively the effects of bloodletting on insulin sensitivity and secretion, serum biochemical parameters, liver iron content (LIC), and histology in nine normal glucose tolerant (NGT) subjects and eight subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes with either HH or heterozygous HFE gene mutations before and after 2 years of bloodletting procedures.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—The study participants were recruited from all consecutive male newly diagnosed HFE homozygous or heterozygous mutation carrier referrals to the Hemochromatosis Unit at the SanFilippo Neri General Hospital from January 2003 to December 2006. Healthy male subjects (n = 10), enrolled in a contemporaneous study at Catholic University (15), and healthy blood donors (n = 23) at SanFilippo Neri General Hospital served as control subjects. They were not smokers; were matched for age, BMI, and body composition; did not have biochemical signs of iron overload (ferritin &lt;300 μg/l and transferrin saturation &lt;45%); and had no evidence of ultrasound liver brightness.Inclusion criteria were male sex, age 40–60 years, BMI ≤30 kg/m2, no serious associated illness (heart failure, cirrhosis, or panhypopituitarism), and no consumption of alcohol or use of medications. Only NGT and diabetic subjects were enrolled (16), whereas those with impaired glucose tolerance (three subjects) were excluded. All subjects received general nutritional counseling at baseline with prescription of a balanced diet regimen (carbohydrate 50–60%, fat 23–30%, and protein 15–20%) but no extra physical activity. A1C &gt;7.5% at baseline or during the follow-up was considered a reason for dropping out of the study.Diagnosis of HFE mutations (Cys282Tyr, His63Asp, and Ser65Cys) was genetically confirmed by real-time PCR. Non-HFE gene mutations (TFR2, c-HAMP, and HJV) were tested. Conversely, HFE and non-HFE gene mutations were ruled out in healthy subjects (17).Bloodletting was performed every 2 weeks by phlebotomy or erythrocytapheresis (Hemonetics MCS-plus Blood Cell Processor; Hemonetics, Braintree, MA), and blood volume was restored to normal by hemodilution using a normal saline solution. In phlebotomy, 450 ml of blood was removed for each procedure.Patients were admitted to the unit for clinical and iron balance evaluation every 2 weeks. In the beginning, treatment was done every 2 weeks to achieve the target value of ferritin ≤100 ng/ml and saturation ≤45% in patients with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) negative for iron depots in liver or ≤50 ng/ml and saturation ≤30% in patients with NMR positive for iron accumulation; thereafter, timing of procedures was based on the individual need to maintain these values. At baseline and at 24 months, body composition, insulin secretion and sensitivity, liver NMR and heart ultrasound results, liver histology, and iron content were evaluated.The study protocol conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and to the recommendations of the Ethics Committee at the SanFilippo Neri General Hospital. The nature and the purpose of the study were carefully explained before informed consent was requested from each patient.Insulin secretion was calculated as the corrected insulin response from 30-min insulin and glucose levels: {insulin 30/[glucose 30 × (glucose 30–3.9)}] (milli-International Units × millimoles squared) (18). The insulinogenic index (IGI) was calculated as (insulin 30 − insulin 0)/(glucose 30 − glucose 0) (19).Insulin sensitivity was estimated by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp as described previously (20). Whole-body glucose uptake (M value in micromoles per kilogram free fat mass [FFM] per minute) was determined during a primed constant infusion of insulin (at the rate of 6 pmol · min−1 · kg−1). It was normalized for kilograms of FFM.Body composition was estimated by the isotopic dilution method. FFM (in kilograms) was obtained by dividing total body water by 0.73 (21).Histological features of steatosis, inflammation (portal and lobular), hepatocyte ballooning, and fibrosis were scored by using the scoring system for NAFLD (22). Features of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning were combined in a score going from 0 to 8, named the NAFLD activity score (NAS). NAS ≥5 is diagnostic of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NAS ≤2 is diagnostic of simple steatosis, and values in between are considered indeterminate.Liver iron content (LIC) was measured in all subjects by means of atomic absorption spectroscopy according to the method of Barry and Sherlock (23). Liver tissue samples of at least 0.5 mg dry weight that had been frozen immediately at −20°C after collection were used.Serum was stored at −80°C for later assays. Plasma insulin and C-peptide were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay (MYRIA Technogenetics, Milan, Italy). A1C was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (L-9100; Hitachi, Rahway, NJ).StatisticsData are presented as means ± SEM. Before statistical analysis, normal distribution and homogeneity of the variances were tested. Parameters that did not fulfill tests were log transformed before analysis. To evaluate the effect of 24-month bloodletting on continuous variables, a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used. To compare the effect of bloodletting in NGT and diabetic subjects separately at baseline and at the end of the follow-up, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed. To compare HFE gene mutation carriers versus healthy subjects and to evaluate the effect of blood withdrawn throughout the follow-up, it was necessary to perform repeated ANOVA and post hoc analysis (Bonferroni post hoc test), whenever appropriate.Relationships between variables were determined by linear correlation analysis (Spearman's r), and regression analysis was performed by standard techniques. Levels of statistical significance were set at P &lt; 0.05. Data analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software (V12.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL).RESULTSComparison of carriers of HFE gene mutations versus control subjectsControl subjects were matched with both diabetic and NGT groups of HFE gene mutation carriers in age, BMI, and FFM. Fasting glucose and insulin did not differ. Control subjects had significantly lower total cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes, serum iron, and transferrin compared with NGT and diabetic patients at baseline and after 2 years (statistical significance shown in Table 1). Insulin secretion was significantly lower in diabetic subjects (P ≤ 0.05, both at baseline and after 2 years). Insulin sensitivity was greater in control subjects than in diabetic subjects before (P ≤ 0.0001) and after iron depletion (P ≤ 0.0001).Baseline values in groups of carriers of HFE gene mutationsAt baseline, NGT and diabetic subjects differed significantly in fasting glucose (P ≤ 0.0001), A1C (P ≤ 0.0001), triglycerides (P = 0.05), insulin sensitivity (P = 0.001) and secretion, and IGI (P ≤ 0.0001 for both) (Table 1). No significant differences were found in aminotransferases, whereas LIC (P = 0.004) and NAS (P = 0.02) were significantly higher in diabetic subjects (Table 2).Effect of the treatment in carriers of HFE gene mutationsNo subject with diabetes dropped out the study because of A1C &gt;7.5%, and no subjects discontinued the study. The goal values of ferritin and saturation were obtained in all subjects by month 5. To achieve these values, 8 ± 3 procedures in NGT vs. 9 ± 2 procedures in diabetic subjects were needed. Throughout the whole study, NGT subjects underwent a total of 21 ± 2 vs. 20 ± 1 procedures in diabetic subjects.A significant improvement in several metabolic parameters was seen as soon as the treatment was initiated. At month 4, ferritin (1,039.4 ± 129.8 vs. 264.1 ± 27.8 ng/ml; P ≤ 0.0001), iron (130.3 ± 8.9 vs. 67.5 ± 5.8 μg/dl; P ≤ 0.0001), and saturation (67 ± 3 vs. 42 ± 2%; P ≤ 0.001) significantly decreased. Cholesterol (243.9 ± 9.0 vs. 209.1 ± 7.5 mg/dl; P = 0.008), triglycerides (210.8 ± 10.2 vs. 168.35 ± 9.1 mg/dl; P = 0.005), fasting glycemia (115.1 ± 6.1 vs. 92.1 ± 4.6 mg/dl; P = 0.01), lactate dehydrogenase (329.8 ± 18.1 vs. 282.7 ± 11.5 IU/l; P = 0.05), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (43.1 ± 2.7 vs. 32.1 ± 2.3 IU/l; P = 0.01), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (67.1 ± 4.1 vs. 45.2 ± 2.4 IU/l; P = 0.001), and γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) (62.9 ± 4.3 vs. 39.8 ± 4.1 IU/l; P ≤ 0.0001) significantly ameliorated. Time courses of the most representative variables are depicted separately for NGT and diabetic subjects in Fig. 1.At the end of the study, bloodletting was associated with an improved metabolic pathway. Compared with baseline, ferritin decreased to 58.1 ± 4.2 ng/ml (P ≤ 0.0001) and serum iron to 41.0 ± 1.5 μg/dl (P ≤ 0.0001). Cholesterol (201.2 ± 4.3 mg/dl; P ≤ 0.0001), lactate dehydrogenase (295.8 ± 13.5 IU/l; P = 0.004), AST (30.8 ± 2.0 IU/l; P ≤ 0.0001), ALT (43.8 ± 3.2 IU/l; P ≤ 0.0001), γ-GT (41.6 ± 3.9 IU/l; P ≤ 0.0001), triglycerides (146.5 ± 8.3 mg/dl P ≤ 0.0001), and fasting glycemia (94.9 ± 4.6 mg/dl; P = 0.01) ameliorated in all subjects. Table 1 shows mean ± SEM values separately for NGT and diabetic subjects.For insulin metabolism (Table 1), after 2 years, insulin secretion increased by 20 ± 4% in NGT and 33 ± 7% in diabetic subjects (NS); IGI increased by 16 ± 5 and 47 ± 19%, respectively (NS); and glucose uptake increased by 25 ± 5 and 18 ± 3% (NS). Diabetic subjects had significantly lower insulin secretion, IGI, and insulin sensitivity than NGT subjects (P ≤ 0.0001 for all parameters before and after treatment). LIC decreased by 46 ± 2 in NGT and by 35 ± 2% in diabetic subjects. Figure 2 shows changes in insulin sensitivity, secretion, IGI, and LIC for each subject from both groups.Table 2 shows histological findings, LIC, and NAS in NGT and diabetic subjects at baseline and after 24 months. No subject had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. In diabetic subjects, liver steatosis (P = 0.02) and inflammation (P = 0.03) were significantly reduced with respect to baseline.Statistical correlationsLevels of circulating iron correlated significantly with ALT (r0 = 0.703; P ≤ 0.0001), AST (r0 = 0.765; P ≤ 0.0001), γ-GT (r0 = 0.771; P ≤ 0.0001), C-peptide (r0 = −0.361; P = 0.015), LIC (r0 = 0.484; P = 0.004), glucose uptake (r0 = −0.360; P = 0.004), NAS (r0 = 0.364; P = 0.03), cholesterol (r0 = 0.573; P ≤ 0.0001), triglycerides (r0 = 0.679; P ≤ 0.0001), IGI (r0 = 0.337; P = 0.002), and HbA2 (r0 = 0.301; P = 0.03). Significant correlations were found between ferritin and AST (r0 = 0.778; P ≤ 0.0001), ALT (r0 = 0.592; P ≤ 0.0001), γ-GT (r0 = 0.735; P ≤ 0.0001), C-peptide (r0 = −0.314; P = 0.04), LIC (r0 = 0.40; P = 0.02), NAS (r0 = 0.393; P = 0.02), cholesterol (r0 = 0.418; P ≤ 0.0001), triglycerides (r0 = 0.629; P ≤ 0.0001), IGI (r0 = 0.255; P = 0.02), and HbA2 (r0 = 0.289; P = 0.04).In NGT (y = −0.2376x + 50.286; R2 = 0.40, P ≤ 0.0001) and diabetic subjects (y = −0.2905x + 55.425; R2 = 0.41, P ≤ 0.0001), LIC correlated with glucose uptake. In NGT subjects, LIC correlated also with triglycerides (r0 = 0.563; P = 0.015) and negatively with insulin secretion (r0 = −0.676; P ≤ 0.0001).In diabetic subjects, LIC correlated with NAS (r0 = 0.649; P = 0.007). IGI (r0 = −0.589; P = 0.016) and triglycerides (r0 = 0.775; P ≤ 0.0001) were related to ALT levels.In a multistep linear regression analysis, the best predictors of whole-body glucose uptake in HFE gene mutation carriers (R2 = 0.55; P ≤ 0.0001) were LIC (β = −0.549; P ≤ 0.0001) and triglycerides (β = −0.307; P = 0.03). BMI, ferritin, iron, ALT, insulin secretion, IGI, and NAS were excluded variables.CONCLUSIONS—In patients with phenotypic appearance of HFE gene mutations, iron overload is associated with impaired insulin metabolism and features of metabolic syndrome. β-Cell function deteriorates to a larger extent than insulin sensitivity in the early development of diabetes related to the HFE gene mutations. Insulin resistance occurs when glucose tolerance is still preserved and becomes more severe later when glucose tolerance is impaired. Thus, both aspects contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of diabetes in these patients. Constant iron depletion ameliorates all biochemical and histological features associated with metabolic syndrome. β-Cell activity ameliorates as well as glucose uptake. Subjects with the latter keep showing lower levels of secretion and sensitivity compared with NGT patients even after achieving a normalization of iron balance.These findings confirm recent data from McClain's group (7,8), but they also add significant insights to our knowledge of the pathophysiology of diabetes associated with HFE gene mutations. In a small cohort of selected homozygous patients, McClain et al. found NGT subjects having normal insulin secretion and sensitivity, whereas subjects with impaired glucose tolerance compensated for diminished insulin secretion by increased insulin sensitivity. Subjects in whom this compensatory mechanism failed seemed to be those who developed overt diabetes, showing lower insulin secretion rates but normal glucose uptake (8).In the present cohort of homozygous and heterozygous subjects, we observed values of glucose uptake in NGT subjects overlapping with those of healthy volunteers, thus confirming a previous report in nondiabetic, noncirrhotic carriers of heterogeneous HFE gene mutations (24). In diabetic subjects both insulin sensitivity and secretion are significantly impaired. It is conceivable that the lower value of glucose uptake that we observed in our diabetic subjects might be due to the genetic heterogeneity of our cohort compared with that of Klein's series.Furthermore, values of glucose uptake, apparently within a normal range in NGT subjects, are further enhanced after iron depletion, as already described in healthy frequent blood donors (4), suggesting that high levels of circulating iron can reduce the potential insulin sensitivity of a subject. In healthy volunteers, 75% of glucose uptake occurs in muscle and the remaining 25% in liver. It has been hypothesized that these proportions may be modified in presence of iron overload (25). Accordingly, we found that the liver iron depot correlates with systemic glucose uptake and its reduction is associated with the amelioration of histological grading and NAS (Table 2). In this regard, NGT carriers of HFE gene mutations have a mean value of liver iron content that is below the threshold commonly considered as diagnostic for hemochromatosis, and this value is significantly reduced after treatment. In diabetic subjects, who have higher levels of LIC than NGT subjects, iron depletion is associated with the improvement of all parameters related to insulin metabolism, liver function, and histology. The decrease in liver iron content is associated with the significant amelioration of steatosis and inflammation, perhaps because iron is able to participate in the formation of powerful oxidant species (26). These differences in outcomes may be due to the multifactorial nature of the transition from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in carriers of HFE gene mutations. Overweight/obesity-related steatosis, high levels of triglycerides, or the presence of obesity-related morbidities may play a role as cofactors.In summary, we have demonstrated that the loss of insulin secretory capacity can be the primary event leading to HFE gene mutation–related diabetes, but the role for decreased insulin sensitivity cannot be disregarded, with liver acting as a primary site of insulin resistance and contributing to the ultimate expression of diabetes. Increased body fatness, environmental factors, and risk factors for metabolic syndrome can work together. Thus, obesity and related morbidities should be actively addressed in the management of carriers of HFE gene mutations. Especially important for the prevention of diabetes-related morbidities that can occur very early, this would justify glucose tolerance testing of carriers of HFE gene mutations as well as prophylactic iron depletion in unaffected individuals with diagnosed disease. The reversibility of iron-related abnormalities in insulin metabolism warrants further investigation.Figure 1— Time courses of plasma triglycerides (A) and glucose (B), serum ferritin (C), iron (D), and levels of ALT (E) in NGT (dotted line) and diabetic (solid line) subjects with HFE gene mutations.

Teaching Patients How to Use Inhaled Insulin,"Anne L. Peters, MD: Ever since I completed a research study using inhaled insulin, I found myself using it a lot more frequently. I realized that in doing this study, not only did I get used to it and how it worked in my patients, but I also developed a way to teach patients how to use it. I basically reduced the barriers to my using it, and now I use it often; therefore, I'm quite comfortable with it. I wanted to share that experience with you and also have you learn from Mark Harmel, my diabetes educator, who is so good at teaching patients how to use it that it works quite effectively. Inhaled insulin works as follows. You have a patient pick a dose; it comes in a cartridge of 4, 8, or 12 units. The patient takes the dose just before eating. The insulin works very fast and it also goes away pretty quickly. It helps the patient really catch that first postprandial rise. If the patient's glucose level is high after eating, they can take another puff to bring down that blood glucose level. It doesn't cause the stacking phenomenon that you get with injected insulin. When to Take It Inhaled insulin is really good at the start of a meal. It's also a great correction insulin. My patients will use it after a meal—1 to 2 hours later if they have high levels—or when they're running high. For example, if a patient is on a sensor and he sees that his levels have been high all afternoon, he can take a puff of the inhaled insulin and his glucose level will come back down without going too low. Inhaled insulin is an incredibly useful tool for my patients with diabetes. I use it in both type 1 individuals and people with type 2 diabetes who are on insulin. The way I start patients is by having them pick one meal—usually dinner. I'm not a big believer in having a patient switch entirely to a different way [of taking insulin]. Obviously, patients stay on their basal insulin and I usually have them get used to taking it before dinner. How Much to Take Many patients may be nervous at first and they often don't take enough. They say, ""Oh, I only need 4 units."" Well, that's not true in most cases; they'll need 8 or 12 units. I let them work up and then see the effects. It's easy for patients who are on a continuous glucose monitor to see the effect of the inhaled insulin and see if their blood sugar is subsequently high. Those who are self-monitoring blood glucose with finger sticks can test an hour or two after a meal to see if they need a correction. I'll start patients with taking it with one meal a day and then advance to more meals per day as they fit this into their routine. I see it as an exceedingly useful tool to add to what my patients already have for managing their diabetes. Some patients will use it often (for every meal), some patients use it for correction, and some patients use it for both. The key to getting a patient to use inhaled insulin comfortably is in the teaching. I'm going to have Mark give you a lesson on how to teach your patients the correct way to use inhaled insulin. Teaching Your Patients Mark Harmel, MPH: Thank you, Anne. When I get study participants or patients in the clinic, the first thing I do is a lung test. We have to check and see if their lungs are healthy enough to use inhaled insulin. We use this device that measures lung capacity to do the FEV1 test. There is a little cardboard tube that goes onto this device. The patient takes a deep breath and blows it out very quickly, and then we measure the reading on the front of the device. We put that into a CDC website calculator, and if their lung capacity is at 75% or more, they qualify to use inhaled insulin. Next, you have to teach the patient how to inhale. There is this inhaler that's about the size of a whistle. You pop it open, and there are individual cartridges that you insert into the inhaler. You can see that there's a little point on the tip of one of them, and the tub that holds the powdered insulin is at the bottom. The tub goes down, you fit the point on the cartridge to the point on the inside of the inhaler, and then you snap it closed. Once you close the inhaler, it's important to keep it level because the insulin will fall out if you tip it over. Take off the mouth guard, take a little sip of water, inhale smoothly and gently, hold it in your lungs for a few seconds, and then exhale. There's a video on the Afrezza website that worked wonders for some of my patients. We also have to teach patients how to take care of the insulin. Inside the package, there are two folded pieces of paper. One of them has the typical drug warnings that are in many of your medications. Another paper has some nice illustrated instructions. There is also the refrigeration page. Just like your liquid insulin, you have to keep it refrigerated. It could take a couple of days or a week before patients really get the hang of using inhaled insulin. Be conservative to start, and make sure that patients have their fast-acting glucose with them in case they use too much. They'll learn how to use it over time. Many people find that they really like inhaled insulin as an option. Some people shift to it completely for mealtime use and others only use it occasionally. Your patients will find what's right for them. Peters: Thank you very much for that, Mark. If you feel comfortable with this, take the time to teach your patients, and have them watch the appropriate videos. You can teach your patients to quickly become experts in using inhaled insulin. Hopefully, it can help improve their outcomes.",https://t.co/d4gGIGMIv8,others
Why The Insulin Rationing Trend Continues,"After collapsing at his job and spending a week in a hospital, Thomas Strathmann of Bozeman, Mont., left with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and two boxes of insulin. He was told they would last ""a few days,"" he remembers. The next box would cost between $500 and $600. He was 28 and uninsured. An emergency mental health clinician, Strathmann earned just enough to not qualify for Medicaid and says he couldn't afford a plan on the Healthcare Marketplace (""Obamacare""). He turned to the same local nonprofit health service to which he referred clients. The organization offers single-use insulin ""pens,"" charging on a sliding scale according to income. For the last three years, he's bought boxes that contain five pens each at $10 a box. The supply is supposed to last five days. He is unsure what he would do if the charity closed or he became ineligible for the program. ""I can't describe this situation where you are required to have something to live and can only have as much as it as you can get at any one time,"" Strathmann says. Out of concern that something will interrupt his supply, he has started skipping doses and stockpiling pens. Who's Rationing Insulin? One of four people with diabetes in America have rationed insulin, according to a Yale University study released in December. The cost of diabetes medicines has increased exponentially in the last 20 years, forcing patients to struggle with out-of-pocket expenses. One study, published in JAMA, showed that the price of insulin as charged at the pharmacy tripled from 2002 to 2013. It's continued to skyrocket since. A study from the Health Care Cost Institute, published last month, measured a spike from 2012 to 2016 in terms of how much is spent on Americans with type 1 diabetes (by insurance companies, governments, or patients as a total). It doubled from an average of $2,864 per patient in 2012 to $5,705 in 2016. To cover these costs, some diabetics are skimping on insulin. ""I hear about it once a week,"" says Kevin Codorniz, M.D., medical director of diabetes treatment at Loma Linda University Health in Southern California. ""Their share of cost is so high that it's prohibitive for them"" to take the amount prescribed. David Nathan, M.D., director of the Diabetes Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, says he's heard from patients struggling to afford $300 to $500 a month in out-of-pocket expenses. Some tell him they skip dosages. ""I assume [others] are embarrassed to tell me,"" Nathan says. It's the prideful or shy patients he worries most about.What Happens When You Skip Insulin DosesThe results of insulin rationing can be deadly. In February of 2017, Shane Patrick Boyle died of diabetic ketoacidosis in Arkansas, shortly after aging out of the Obamacare provision that allowed him to stay on a parent's insurance plan until age 26, and after failing to raise enough for a month's supply of insulin on GoFundMe. In another publicized case, Alec Smith, a Minnesota restaurant manager with type 1 diabetes, also departing his parents' insurance plan at 26, died while looking for affordable insurance options.Dr. Codorniz warns that under-utilizing insulin can cause a diabetic coma, and can have dire long-term effects, including kidney disease, infections and risk of stroke and amputations. ""Most people don't know,"" he says. ""They think they're too young [for rationing] to hurt them. It's ten years down the road when you these complications concern you."" Insulin has been used since the 1920s and has been produced in roughly the same way for decades — harvesting it from an animal pancreas or using recombinant DNA techniques to create and extract it from bacteria. There have been some new products for diabetes, such as insulin pumps and longer-lasting drugs, but most of these are for unique or severe cases or people with high-quality health coverage. Most patients use basic forms of insulin that have existed for decades, according to Dr. Codorniz, with pharmaceutical companies making tweaks to the medication or delivery process to maintain patents.AfricadventuresGetty ImagesWhat Drug Companies Are DoingSome patients have blamed drug manufacturers for inflating the prices. In 2017, people with diabetes filed a class action lawsuit against Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in a Massachusetts court, accusing the three companies of working in ""lock step"" to increase prices of their nearly identical products. In 2018, the attorney general of Minnesota filed suit against the same three companies, accusing them of raising insulin prices in cahoots.Eli Lilly has responded to the fury by manufacturing an ""authorized generic"" version of their insulin Humalog for $137, half the price of its usual cost and opening a ""solution center"" where patients can call to ask about lower-cost options.Dr. Codorniz warns it's ""a complicated matter; it's not just the drug companies being greedy."" He said many have offered low-income and underinsured patients rebate coupons, but these rebates often have the effect of driving up copays for consumers. The American Diabetes Association has spoken out against the rise in costs and made policy proposals, including streamlining the process to get Food and Drug Administration approval for generic versions of insulin medications, guaranteeing pricing transparency, and increasing access all around. The organization has also created a guidecontaining suggestions and resources for anyone struggling to afford insulin.Dr. Nathan says it's time for the government to implement cost controls. ""There are no adults in the room,"" he says. ""There is no one telling the pharmaceutical industry, 'You can't do what you want.'""For Thomas Strathmann, there is a stark before-and-after the day he collapsed due to diabetic ketoacidosis. He has transitioned to less stressful work, cashiering at a ski shop and doing landscaping. He says he's careful not to earn too much money. ""It's this Catch-22 where if you earn too much, you can't get insulin, but if you earn too little, you can't afford to eat.""He used to enjoy trail running and other mountain sports. Now he goes on an occasional mental health walk. The biggest change is a constant state of anxiety over his health. ""Experiencing this on a daily basis is crippling,"" he says. ""It's on your mind from when you get up to the time you get to sleep.""",https://t.co/A7X10LCpG5,others

"The Moose with the Pump: A book for children with type 1 diabetes (Learning to Live with Diabetes for Children): Mr Yerachmiel B Altman, Mr Moose With Pump, Mrs Sara Chana Altman: 9781540709981: Amazon.com: Books","Reviewed By Mamta Madhavan for Readers' Favorite The Moose with the Pump by Yerachmiel Altman is about David Jacob, the little blue moose who has type 1 diabetes. His parents tell him that he need not be scared as they will not let him down and, with the right information, he will be safe and sound. They tell him that they will help him to learn to keep his sugar good all day using shots, blood tests, pumps, and sensors. His big sister, Adina, also knows how to take care of him. Winter is coming and David wants to play in the snow and be safe at the same time. Will David be able to play in the snow? What happens when they meet The Moose with the Pump? Read the story to find out! The story is adorable and shows how children with type 1 diabetes can play safely in the snow. It is informative to many parents and it also guides children to take care of themselves by showing them how to use insulin pumps, glucose sensors, and other machines associated with diabetes care. The story is written in a poetic manner, making it lyrical and giving the story a good pace and movement. The illustrations are colorful and endearing and they bring the characters and scenes alive. It is a good bedtime storybook and also good for read aloud sessions in classrooms and school libraries as it gives information about how to take care when one has type 1 diabetes. Mike Hoskins for DiabetesMineWith the title ""The Moose with the Pump,"" this 26-pager is also written in poetic form to tell the story of a little (blue moose) boy with T1D who's at home on a snowy day with his sister, but can't go outdoors to play with friends because there's so much snow outside.That is, until a mysterious adult Moose With a Pump appears, sharing his story about living with T1D for many years using an insulin pump and CGM; he explains that it's OK to go outside and play as long as you're safe.Yerachmiel describes this book as ""Dr. Suess style,"" and through that format outlines many D-management issues from a child's POV - the cautions needed for hypoglycemia, having supplies handy in case of an emergency, making sure parents and friends are aware of what can happen, and of course the fun you can still have even with diabetes on board. Sprinkled throughout, you can find cartoon-style images of the Dexcom receiver, Tandem insulin pump and glucose meters. Seriously, the posed-toy photos and sing-songy poem style made me smile till my cheeks hurt... especially when the little boy and his sister are talking D-management with the visiting Moose, who even took the initiative to shovel and snow-blow the ""white stuff"" outdoors.In the end, thanks to the Moose's advice (Ask the Moose?), the siblings have their fears allayed and ask their mom if they can go outside to play; they even help the Moose clean up the sidewalks (Spoiler Alert: She says yes, because You CAN Do This!).What a fun read this one was, and we definitely recommend it for the diabetes bookshelf at home, in a doctor's office or in schools -- wherever D-kids can be found. healthline.com/diabetesmine/moose-and-giraffe-diabetes-books-giveaway#1",https://t.co/FHKW63OWG4,others
"On rising insulin prices, lawmaker tells pharma execs: 'Your days are numbered'","(CNN) -- Lawmakers tensed with frustration, some clenching their jaws, while grilling a panel of pharmacy and pharmaceutical company executives about the soaring cost of insulin during a congressional hearing on Wednesday. The tension could be felt as some executives fidgeted in their chairs while answering lawmakers' questions.The hearing, held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on Capitol Hill, was the second this month to examine how fast-rising insulin costs affect diabetes patients across the United States.The average price of insulin tripled over the course of a decade, from $4.34 per milliliter in 2002 to $12.92 per milliliter in 2013, according to a study published in the medical journal JAMA in 2016.Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky vehemently said during the hearing that prices of insulin are ""curiously close"" between manufacturers and ""way too high.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" she told the panel of executives.""We have the names of people who have died because they couldn't get their insulin,"" she said. ""This is a commitment on the part of the Congress to get drug prices -- particularly life-saving life necessities -- to get those prices under control. ... Your days are numbered.""In response, several executives -- including Doug Langa of Novo Nordisk and Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi -- pointed to how the health care system is ""broken,"" and they all agreed it was unacceptable that some patients are struggling to afford medications.As the hearing adjourned, lawmakers made clear that an investigation into the rising cost of insulin and what can be done about the issue will continue.Companies aim to lower costs; lawmakers argue it's not enoughPeople with diabetes are prescribed insulin because their bodies either do not produce it (as with Type 1 diabetes) or do not use it properly (as with Type 2 diabetes). There are more than 20 types of insulin sold in the United States, according to the American Diabetes Association.Ahead of Wednesday's hearing, pharmaceutical company Sanofi announced plans to reduce the price of insulin for qualifying patients to $99 a month for up to 10 boxes of pens or 10-milliliter vials.The new monthly price for qualifying patients will start in June, according to the company.""It is unacceptable to Sanofi that some people living with diabetes are struggling to pay for their insulin, so we have moved to act creatively and aggressively to help address affordability and access needs,"" Michelle Carnahan, head of North America Primary Care at Sanofi, said in the announcement.""By giving those who require both long-acting and/or mealtime insulins or use more than one box of pens or one vial per month access to their insulins for one flat price, we aim to help limit the burden on the individuals who have high out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter,"" she said.US Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who helped launch a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices in February, called the move ""a step in the right direction"" in a written statement Wednesday.""But like Cigna's announcement on insulin prices last week, this raises a lot of questions. Why was Sanofi charging so much more before this announcement? What took them so long to offer the price reduction?"" he added. ""It shouldn't take months of bad press, persistent public outcry and increasing congressional scrutiny to get a company to charge a fair price. That's not how a functioning marketplace works.""Health insurer Cigna said last week that it's launching a program that will cap out-of-pocket expenses at $25 for a 30-day supply of insulin. Last year, patients paid an average of $41.50 a month out of pocket, including deductibles, copays or coinsurance, for the lifesaving diabetes drug, according to the company.Its Patient Assurance Program will be available to members of participating nongovernment-funded pharmacy plans managed by Express Scripts, including Cigna and other plans. Cigna acquired Express Scripts, the largest US pharmacy benefit management company, in December.""In most cases, people who use insulin will see lower out-of-pocket costs without any increased cost to the plan,"" the company said.'A matter of life and death'Also last week, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that it intends to bring competition to the insulin market as a way to lower prices. Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the agency would change how insulin is regulated in order to enable products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, insulin to come to market.""Access to affordable insulin can be a matter of life and death for Americans with diabetes. Insulin is a critical hormone that regulates sugar metabolism,"" Gottlieb said in the announcement.""But access to this critical drug can be increasingly difficult for these Americans. Insulin list prices regularly increase by double digits annually,"" he said. ""Driving down drug prices requires a comprehensive approach. But one impactful route is through competition. This is particularly true following the introductions of generics, especially when there are three or more generic competitors -- which has been shown to bring down prices more sharply than with only one or two generic competitors.""In March, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a cheaper generic version of its rapid-acting insulin Humalog. At half the price of Humalog, the generic insulin lispro will carry a list price of $137.35 per vial, the company said, or $265.20 for a pack of five pens. Brand-name Humalog will remain on the market.Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette, chairwoman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, said at Wednesday's hearing that Humalog cost only $35 a vial in 2001 and that the price increased even though the drug formulary remained the same.""Let's not kid ourselves that the generic equivalent of this is really any cheaper,"" she said shortly before the hearing adjourned.The-CNN-Wire™ &amp; © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Selling a Lifetime of Insulin for $3,"As if balancing blood sugar levels was not hard enough, people affected by Type 1 also must balance their checkbooks as they try to afford life-sustaining insulin. That stress is aggravated when drug companies make it clear they view insulin as a cash cow, either by raising insulin prices much faster than the cost of production or by engaging in protracted legal battles to keep long-acting insulin formations from going generic.It didn't start that way. In fact, the first ""sale of insulin was for just $3 (Canadian), not for a vial, but the very intellectual property of the drug itself. Frederick Banting, Charles Best, and James Collip, the team that first discovered and refined insulin therapy, agreed to receive $1 each in exchange for giving their patent rights to the Board of Governors of the University of Toronto in 1923.This was a bold move, and not without controversy at the time, according to an article posted by the University of Toronto Centre for Innovation Law and Policy. At the turn of the 20th century, it was considered beneath scientists and universities to patent medical innovation at all. However, Banting and company believed that they needed to patent their formulation of insulin to stop pharmaceutical companies from rushing to patent an inferior, less potent form of the drug. The university immediately gave pharmaceutical companies the right to manufacture insulin, royalty-free, and to improve upon the formulation and patent any subsequent improvements.[adrotate banner=""58″]This may seem like a move that lets the genie out of the bottle, but it's important to put it into historical context. Mass producing insulin was an incredibly difficult process at the time, and fraught with peril. The original team had trouble recreating the process to make uniformly potent insulin, and at one point it was even feared that they had lost the ability to do the process at all. Meanwhile, they knew this drug was a matter of life and death for thousands of children who were otherwise dying from Type 1. In such circumstances, it seems to make sense that the best action would be to get the drug in the hands of those who could best manufacture the drug on a large scale.[adrotate banner=""61″]It worked, as within two years, Eli Lilly and Company was able to produce 60 million vials of insulin, according to Dr. Irl Hirsch, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine (as told to health blogger David Mendosa).It wasn't long before drug companies had figured out a way to turn a good profit on insulin, even by possibly illegal means. By 1941, Eli Lilly and Company and two other pharmaceutical companies were indicted for an alleged insulin price-fixing scheme at the time, according to a Chicago-Tribune article; it was a charge that Lilly would settle in a ""no contest agreement.The price of insulin began to climb sharply once drug companies devised how to make synthetic insulin in the late seventies, and there has been little relief since that time. It is now a billion-dollar industry. Unfortunately, as the legal battles over long-acting insulin formulations demonstrate, it will be difficult in the free market to bring insulin prices back in line with the first altruistic principles that Banting and company demonstrated when they sold their idea of insulin for a dollar apiece. One can only hope that those behind future diabetes breakthroughs take a similar open-source attitude to their discoveries as the creators of insulin therapy did*.*To read about a movement that seems to be following this open source ideology, go to http://insulinnation.com/devices/meters-and-cgms/diabetes-hacker/ or follow the CGM in the Cloud movement at https://www.facebook.com/groups/cgminthecloud/.Have Type 2 diabetes or know someone who does?

Human Insulin for Type 2 Diabetes,"Switching from expensive, newer-generation insulin analogs to older, lower-priced human insulin formulations may appeal to some patients with type 2 diabetes.But is it effective? Or safe?Two recent studies published in JAMA looked at human insulin and found essentially the same thing: overall, type 2 diabetes patients treated with human insulin formulations did not have worse outcomes than patients treated with new insulin analogs.""Our findings add to the growing body of literature suggesting that human insulin may be as safe and effective as newer, more expensive insulin analogs for many patients with type 2 diabetes,"" said Jing Luo, MD, MPH, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who led a cohort study of Medicare patients who switched from analogs to human insulin. ""These findings are especially meaningful for patients or payers who may be struggling with the increasing prices of insulin in the U.S.""Switching to Human InsulinIn a large retrospective cohort study of 14,635 Medicare beneficiaries, Luo and colleagues found a small initial increase in HbA1c when type 2 diabetes patients switched to human insulin and no difference in the rate of severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. But expenses fell considerably, and fewer patients reached the Medicare Part D coverage gap.The researchers evaluated differences in glycemic control and costs before, during, and after a 2015 intervention in which patients were encouraged to switch from analog to human insulin, either premixed human 70/30 or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. The start of the intervention was associated with a small (0.14%) but statistically significant increase in mean HbA1c levels (95% CI 0.05%-0.23%, P=0.003). Twelve months later, mean HbA1c levels stabilized and there were no significant changes among patients who made the switch (0.08%, 95% CI -0.01% to 0.17%).Moreover, total monthly insulin expenditures for these beneficiaries dropped by more than half, from approximately $3.4 million to $1.4 million. And the proportion of patients who reached the Medicare Part D coverage gap decreased from 20.6% to 11.1%.""Our findings suggest that a health plan intervention of switching older adults with type 2 diabetes from insulin analogs to human insulin formulations may be safe and clinically effective,"" Luo said. ""The mean HbA1c difference we found to be associated with the start of switch in the intervention -- a mean change +0.14% -- is likely not clinically significant.""But minor hypoglycemic episodes and nocturnal hypoglycemic events could not be measured in this study, Luo cautioned. And the intervention was conducted in an integrated health system that coordinated efforts between the health plan and clinicians to oversee insulin switching, which may have influenced results.Starting with Human InsulinIn an observational study of type 2 patients from 2006 to 2015, researchers found that people who started treatment with basal insulin analogs -- notably glargine (Lantus) or detemir (Levemir) -- did not have substantially better blood sugar control or lower hypoglycemia risk than patients who started with NPH insulin.""We compared the newer and older types of insulin in a large and diverse population of Kaiser Permanente type 2 diabetes patients who were newly prescribed insulin,"" said lead author Kasia Lipska, MD, MHS, of Yale School of Medicine, in a statement. ""The study was conducted under real-world conditions with uniquely detailed data about possible confounding factors and long-term outcomes.""""We found that for patients with type 2 diabetes in usual practice, the use of the more expensive insulin analogs did not appear to result in better safety -- at least as defined by hospital or emergency visits for hypoglycemia -- or better blood sugar control compared with NPH insulin,"" she noted. ""This suggests that many people with type 2 diabetes should consider starting with NPH insulin, instead of insulin analogs, especially if cost is an issue for them.""Counter to recent prescribing trends in the U.S., Kaiser Permanente of Northern California uses human insulin products preferentially. In this study comparing patients who initiated NPH insulin (n=23,561) with patients who initiated insulin analogs (n=1,928), Lipska and coauthors found that, over a mean follow-up of 1.7 years, hypoglycemia-related emergency department (ED) visits or hospital admissions were 8.8 events per 1,000 person-years in the NPH group and 11.9 events per 1,000 person-years in the analog group.Within 1 year of insulin initiation, HBA1c dropped from 9.4% to 7.9% in the NPH group and from 9.4% to 8.2% in the insulin analog group.But this analysis had limitations: it looked only at hypoglycemia that resulted in ED or hospital visits. Clinicians in the Kaiser Permanente system also had greater familiarity with NPH, which may have reduced the likelihood of hypoglycemia, noted Matthew Crowley, MD, MHS, and Matthew Maciejewski, PhD, both of the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center in North Carolina, in an accompanying editorial.In a recent report, the American Diabetes Association working group on insulin pricing suggested human insulin may be an appropriate alternative to more expensive analog insulins for some people with diabetes. ""What remains unknown is whether there is meaningful heterogeneity in how specific types of patients respond to basal insulin analogs and NPH insulin, and if such heterogeneity does exist, which factors moderate differences in patient responses,"" Crowley and Maciejewski pointed out.""For example, some patient subgroups may experience better clinical and economic outcomes with NPH insulin, some subgroups may have similar outcomes, and some subgroups may experience better clinical and economic outcomes with basal insulin analogs,"" they observed.""In this era of high costs of diabetes care, questions of value in insulin prescribing are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon,"" Crowley and Maciejewski added. ""Newer, even higher-priced basal insulin analogs are now being promoted despite their minor absolute benefits vs current widely used analog options, so questions about value will remain pressing into the foreseeable future.""Luo is a consultant to Alosa Health and Health Action International.Lipska reported no disclosures.Crowley and Maciejewski also reported no disclosures.",https://t.co/BBLAvdSUI7,others

Air travel with refrigerated insulin,"In a couple of weeks I'll be travelling by air on 2 separate airlines with insulin for my dog that must be kept refrigerated else it spoils, and I have no idea how to go about this. I'll probably be travelling with a handful of vials as he'll need a supply before I can get a new prescription for him from a local vet upon arrival.It's delivered to me using those freezer packs, but as they're a gel they won't get through security (I assume). I can't think of any other way to transport this on my person. Can anyone offer some guidance as to how I can keep it cold throughout my travels?I'll be travelling from Manchester Airport (MAN) with Thomas Cook Airlines, and from JFK with American Airlines, if it helps.UPDATE POST TRAVEL (8 April 2019)I chose to travel with ice packs. Travel happened on 4th and 5th April 2019, and involved clearing security at both Manchester airport in the UK, and JFK in the US. Both times I informed security that the bag I was carrying contained insulin that needed to be kept cold, and 2 ice/freezer packs. On both occasions they took the bag and scanned it separately, swabbed it for the various things they swab for, and cleared it with no further issues. Neither of them asked for documentation to prove it was required. I think it also helped that the box of cartridge refills was still sealed, but it also had the product details printed on it, along with a prescription label.At JFK the agent said that the ice packs should have been completely frozen, but due to various delays and the odd schedule we had, we were at the airport for around 6 hours before we were able to check the dogs in and clear security, so they weren't solid ice. That, and the freezer at our hotel didn't work very well, so one of them was barely frozen by the time it came to clearing security. He consulted with his supervisor who allowed him to clear it anyway after a swab.So in conclusion; YES - you can travel with ice packs. Make sure you tell the security agent it's medication that needs to be kept cold. They'll most likely just swab it and allow it to pass. They might say that the ice packs must be completely frozen, but they seem to have enough common sense to do due diligence on it and allow you to proceed.",https://t.co/SnOdWVAGH9,others
Insulin and the insulin receptor regulate gene expression,"Many aspects of the functions of insulin and the insulin receptor are poorly understood. Now, two papers shed new light on their roles in regulating gene expression. Credit: Jennie Vallis/Springer Nature LimitedIn the first study, it was demonstrated that the insulin receptor translocates from the cell surface to the nucleus, where it is associated with RNA polymerase II. Previous work had shown that cell surface receptors could translocate, leading John Flanagan and colleagues to broaden their analyses to include a range of receptors. ""We tested for receptor-associated proteins by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry and were surprised to find that the insulin receptor associated strongly with RNA polymerase II,"" explains Flanagan. ""Our subsequent experiments confirmed that the insulin receptor–RNA polymerase II complex forms on chromatin."" The formation of these complexes was increased when insulin levels were raised in mice, and was impaired in a model of insulin resistance.The researchers also used ChIP-seq to show that the insulin receptor binds to specific sites. ""More than 80% of insulin receptor binding sites were located in gene promoters, an extremely high enrichment considering that promoters are only about 1% of the genome,"" says Flanagan. Next, gene ontology analysis was used to determine that many of the genes with insulin receptor bound to the promoter had protein products known to be involved in the functions of insulin, such as lipid and protein metabolism and the pathophysiology of insulin-related diseases (for instance, diabetes mellitus and cancer).Further analysis of the DNA sequences suggested that the transcriptional co-regulator HCF1 might be involved in mediating the association between the insulin receptor and DNA. The researchers confirmed this association by gene knockdown of HCF1, which blocked the ability of insulin receptors to bind to promoters.""These results identify a novel pathway for insulin to regulate gene expression,"" concludes Flanagan. ""This opens the door to a new area of research into the mechanisms of insulin signalling."" The researchers hope that more work will now be done to investigate the role of this new mechanism in health and disease. ""Seeing how this new pathway can be harnessed for good is going to be exciting work that we and probably others will be thinking about,"" says Flanagan.In the second study, the investigators focused on the role of insulin in regulating transcription. Using a euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp in mice and RNA sequencing, C. Ron Kahn and colleagues found that insulin modulates the transcriptome, affecting up to 1,500 transcripts in skeletal muscle and liver. ""This includes previously studied pathways related to glucose and lipid metabolism, but also many others not previously linked to insulin action, such as mRNA splicing, chromatin remodelling and the regulation of over 150 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs),"" explains Kahn. ""From these insulin-regulated ncRNAs, we have identified the long ncRNA Gm15441 as an important regulator of fatty acid oxidation in liver, thus representing a novel layer of metabolic regulation with potential therapeutic applications.""Kahn and colleagues have begun to elucidate the application of their findings to diabetes mellitus. They compared their own data on the genes that were affected by insulin action with gene expression data sets from mice with either insulin resistance as a result of a high-fat diet or mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus. In muscle, 22 mRNAs were affected in both mouse models, which were involved in mitochondrial function, electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In the liver, the mRNAs affected by both states were involved in transcriptional regulation and transport of organic anions and cationic amino acids. Importantly, nearly 70% of the genes regulated by insulin (according to the clamp experiments) were unaffected in the mouse models, suggesting there are compensatory mechanisms to protect against the negative effects of losing insulin action.""the insulin receptor translocates from the cell surface to the nucleus, where it is associated with RNA polymerase II"" The investigators hope that these findings will provide a basis for future work investigating the effects of insulin on gene expression and the subsequent impact on metabolic control. ""Going forward, we are excited to explore the role of the newly identified ncRNAs and mRNA splicing pathways in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus,"" says Kahn.

Mobile-based insulin dose adjustment for type 2 diabetes in community and rural populations: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Insulin initiation and/or titration for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is often delayed as it is a resource-intensive process, often requiring frequent exchange of information between a patient and their diabetes healthcare professional, such as a credentialed diabetes educator (CDE) for insulin dose adjustment (IDA). Existing models of IDA are unlikely to meet the increasing service demand unless efficiencies are increased. Mobile health (mHealth), a subset of Ehealth, has been shown to improve glycaemic control through enhanced self-management and feedback leading to improved patient satisfaction and could simultaneously reduce costs. Considering the potential benefits of mHealth, we have developed an innovative mHealth-based care model to support patients and clinicians in diabetes specialist community outreach and telehealth clinics, that is, REthinking Model of Outpatient Diabetes care utilizing EheaLth - Insulin Dose Adjustment (REMODEL-IDA). This model primarily aims to improve the glycaemic management of patients with T2DM on insulin, with the secondary aims of improving healthcare service delivery efficiency and the patients' experience.METHODS/DESIGN: A two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted for 3 months with 44 participants, randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either the mHealth-based model of care (intervention) or routine care (control), in diabetes specialist community outreach and telehealth clinics. The intervention arm will exchange information related to blood glucose levels via the Mobile Diabetes Management System developed for outpatients with T2DM. They will receive advice on insulin titration from the CDE via the mobile-app and receive automated text-message prompts for better self-management based on their blood glucose levels and frequency of blood glucose testing. The routine care arm will be followed up via telephone calls by the CDE as per usual practice. The primary outcome is change in glycated haemoglobin, a marker of glycaemic management, at 3 months. Patient and healthcare provider satisfaction, and time required to perform IDA by healthcare providers in both arms will be collected. This pilot study will guide the conduct of a large-scale pragmatic RCT in regional Australia.",https://t.co/bhlAFFXUDh,others
Efficacy of ketogenic diet on body composition during resistance training in trained men: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Ketogenic diets (KD) have become a popular method of promoting weight loss. More recently, some have recommended that athletes adhere to ketogenic diets in order to optimize changes in body composition during training. This study evaluated the efficacy of an 8-week ketogenic diet (KD) during energy surplus and resistance training (RT) protocol on body composition in trained men.METHODS: Twenty-four healthy men (age 30 ± 4.7 years; weight 76.7 ± 8.2 kg; height 174.3 ± 19.7 cm) performed an 8-week RT program. Participants were randomly assigned to a KD group (n = 9), non-KD group (n = 10, NKD), and control group (n = 5, CG) in hyperenergetic condition. Body composition changes were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Compliance with the ketosis state was monitored by measuring urinary ketones weekly. Data were analyzed using a univariate, multivariate and repeated measures general linear model (GLM) statistics.RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in fat mass (mean change, 95% CI; p-value; Cohen's d effect size [ES]; - 0.8 [- 1.6, - 0.1] kg; p &lt; 0.05; ES = - 0.46) and visceral adipose tissue (- 96.5 [- 159.0, - 34.0] g; p &lt; 0.05; ES = - 0.84), while no significant changes were observed in the NKD and CG in fat mass (- 0,5 [- 1.2, 0.3] kg; p &gt; 0.05; ES = - 0.17 and - 0,5 [- 2.4, 1.3] kg; p &gt; 0.05; ES = - 0.12, respectively) or visceral adipose tissue (- 33.8 [- 90.4, 22.8]; p &gt; 0.5; ES = - 0.17 and 1.7 [- 133.3, 136.7]; p &gt; 0.05; ES = 0.01, respectively). No significant increases were observed in total body weight (- 0.9 [- 2.3, 0.6]; p &gt; 0.05; ES = [- 0.18]) and muscle mass (- 0.1 [- 1.1,1.0]; p &gt; 0,05; ES = - 0.04) in the KD group, but the NKD group showed increases in these parameters (0.9 [0.3, 1.5] kg; p &lt; 0.05; ES = 0.18 and (1.3[0.5, 2.2] kg; p &lt; 0,05; ES = 0.31, respectively). There were no changes neither in total body weight nor lean body mass (0.3 [- 1.2, 1.9]; p &gt; 0.05; ES = 0.05 and 0.8 [- 0.4, 2.1]; p &gt; 0.05; ES = 0.26, respectively) in the CG.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a KD might be an alternative dietary approach to decrease fat mass and visceral adipose tissue without decreasing lean body mass; however, it might not be useful to increase muscle mass during positive energy balance in men undergoing RT for 8 weeks.",https://t.co/jT8H5wP9Oc,others
"Visiting Mexico, asking strangers: Diabetics scramble for costly insulin","Mike Lawson will never forget how he ended up in the hospital 12 years ago when he had to decide between making a $300 car payment or buying insulin. ""I made a stupid choice,"" said Lawson, an Oakland resident who has Type 1 diabetes. ""That month I chose to pay for my car payment and to ration insulin."" These days, the price of insulin skyrocketing, and he is stockpiling the drug. Through Twitter, Lawson recently connected with a stranger who said she had four leftover bottles after switching brands. The two exchanged messages and met near her San Francisco office. Letting insulin go to waste ""is almost like tossing gold,"" Lawson said. The price of three commonly used insulin products has increased substantially in recent years. From 2013 to 2019, the cost of NovoLog nearly doubled, going from $289 to $540 per carton, according to according to letters sent in February to drug manufacturers by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating insulin prices. Another common drug, Lantus, rose in price from $244 to $431, the committee said. (The drug's maker, Sanofi, says the numbers rose from $228 to $425 over that time period, but the amount paid to the company actually fell 25% after Sanofi paid rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.) A vial of Humalog, a third popular insulin drug, cost $35 in 2001 and by 2015 had risen to $234, according to the Senate committee. And so, worried about cost, diabetics such as Lawson are increasingly seeking new ways to get, give away or exchange insulin cheaply or for free. Some are using unofficial channels on the internet. Others are traveling to Mexico, where pharmacies sell some popular types of insulin for a fraction of their cost in the United States. Lawson, who now is able to get insulin for a moderate price through insurance even though he still seeks out extra, has also given away some of his insulin to local strangers in need, who find him through Twitter by searching hashtags like #T1D (Type 1 diabetes) and #insulin4all. For the roughly 1.5 million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, the amount of money patients spent on insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $240 to $475 a month, according to a January report from the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care data. And spending in 2017 continued to rise, experts said. ""The risk isn't only that people are being trapped in debt,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, tweeted last weekend. ""Americans have actually died from diabetic ketoacidosis because they had to ration or skip their doses. We need to rein in Big Pharma greed to save lives."" Many stories have emerged nationwide about people who, like Lawson, rationed or delayed buying insulin because they could not afford it, often leading to deadly and dangerous results. About 1 in 4 diabetes patients uses less insulin than prescribed because of costs, according to a 2018 Yale University study. ""It's not just anecdotal, this is relatively widespread,"" said the study co-author Dr. Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. ""There are lots of patients having difficulty affording their insulin."" But why is insulin, which is naturally produced by the pancreas and first discovered for medical use nearly a century ago, so expensive? The scientists who invented it in 1923 sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto for the purpose of making it accessible. But the way the drug is produced and delivered to the body has changed significantly since then. Insulin was initially isolated from animal pancreases, but today it is made by inserting the human insulin gene into bacteria, producing the insulin protein, and then purifying it. Insulin is derived from live organisms and put through a complex process to become a medicine — so it's hard for a competing drug company to make a generic version of it. A handful of drug manufacturers have essentially patented the processes for creating modern-day insulin products just enough to keep exclusive patents under their name, experts said. Only three drug companies sell insulin in the United States: Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk. ""Some of the insulins have dozens of patents on them even though the active ingredient patent has expired,"" said Jeannie Biniek, a health economist who co-wrote the Health Care Cost Institute report. ""There's a question of whether these additional patents are providing a justified return on the investment or, if at some point, they are just providing the company the opportunity to maintain a monopoly on the market."" And, as is the case with many prescription drugs, it's not clear how the ""list price"" of insulin — what a patient would have to pay out of pocket for it, if they do not have insurance — is determined because negotiations between drug companies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers about who pays what are considered proprietary. Drug companies say lowering the list price wouldn't necessarily lead to lower costs for consumers because part of the list price gets paid to pharmacy benefit managers. In recent weeks, amid growing pressure from Congress, the drug companies and some insurers have announced plans to make insulin more affordable. But they fall short of many consumers' expectations. Eli Lilly, which makes Humalog, announced in March it will offer a half-price version of the popular fast-acting insulin for $137 per vial, but has not said when it will be available. A Lilly spokesman said the company also offers a free hotline that consumers can call for information about out-of-pocket reductions at the pharmacy and clinics where donated insulin is available. In April, hours before Sanofi executives were set to testify before a congressional committee on rising insulin prices, the company announced it will sell its insulin products for a fixed price of $99 a month, for up to 10 vials or boxes of insulin pens, to patients paying with cash. Patients who have commercial health insurance are eligible for co-pay cards that may lower their out-of-pocket expenses, a Sanofi spokesman said. Last year, 246,000 people used the co-pay cards and paid nothing or $10 a month for their Sanofi insulin, he said. Sanofi also provides free insulin for low-income uninsured patients who make about $30,000 a year or less. Novo Nordisk has provided free insulin to tens of thousands of uninsured people with diabetes since 2003 and spends $200 million each year on co-pay assistance to patients with commercial health plans. ""We know how challenging it is for a growing number of Americans with diabetes to afford their medicines, including the ones we make,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesman said. ""As a company focused on improving the lives of people with diabetes, this is not acceptable."" Cigna and Express Scripts, which recently merged, announced that they would cap out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $25 a month for patients whose pharmacy plans are managed by Express Scripts. Up to 700,000 people who are on employer-sponsored plans are eligible to receive this benefit if their employer decides to opt in. ""I'm glad to see the mounting pressure and public outcry are having an impact in Lilly releasing this generic and Cigna capping spending, but that's not enough,"" said Lipska, of Yale. ""Those are Band-Aid solutions that don't resolve the underlying issue of very high prices for these insulins."" Indeed, the discount and savings programs aren't reaching everyone. Sabella Larkin of San Diego said she has had to buy insulin in Mexico three times — once in Tijuana and twice in Rosarito. The first time was several years ago, when she was a college student in Texas, while working full time at a tanning salon and struggling to pay her bills. Her insurance at the time wouldn't cover an insulin refill until a certain date, and she couldn't wait. One of her customers at the salon lent her $200 to buy an insulin pen. ""Two weeks later when I got paid, I tried to reimburse her and she said no,"" said Larkin, 28. ""Being in that situation, that's when I went to Mexico and happened to see the insulin I take. It was only $20. I literally cried."" Larkin said she has purchased both NovoLog and Lantus in Mexico for $20 to $25, for the same amount of insulin that would have cost her hundreds of dollars at U.S. pharmacies. ""It was life changing,"" she said. ""It was this added security across the border."" Catherine Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Rhythmic Food Intake Drives Rhythmic Gene Expression More Potently than the Hepatic Circadian Clock in Mice,"Results and DiscussionTo characterize the contribution of RFI to circadian biology and rhythmic gene expression, we developed a feeding system that allows for the long-term manipulation of RFI in the mouse (Figure 1A). This system exposes each mouse to a new feeding compartment every 3 h. We fed mice under 3 feeding paradigms: 1/8th of the daily food intake every 3 h (arrhythmic [AR] feeding), only at night (i.e., night-restricted [NR] feeding), or ad libitum (LB) (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). As previously shown, mice fed LB in a 12:12 h light:dark (LD12:12) cycle exhibit robust rhythms of food intake and eat 75% of their daily food intake at night (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1B). Change to the NR or AR paradigms profoundly affects the daily profile of RFI. While all mice still eat the majority of their food at night, the amount of chow eaten during the light phase varied considerably from 48.9% in AR-fed mice to 0% in NR-fed mice (and 23.8% in LB-fed mice; Figures 1B and 1C). Because AR-fed mice displayed difficulties in adapting fully to the AR-feeding paradigm and ate less from Zeitgeber time (ZT)6 to ZT12, we doubled the number of mice and separated them after 5 weeks into an AR group (robust dampening of RFI) and dampened rhythm (DR) feeding group (less robust dampening of RFI) (Figures 1B and 1C).Figure 1Mice Fed AR Remain Behaviorally RhythmicShow full caption(A) Overview of the feeding system. An 8-compartment food dispenser is placed on a 24-h timer and capped by a lid such that only one compartment is accessible at a time.(B) Average food eaten from each of the eight compartments for 7 consecutive days in mice acclimated to their feeding paradigm for 4 weeks (mean ± SEM; n = 18 per paradigm).

The yellow bar indicates time of dispenser change-out at ZT8. Shading represents the SEM.To determine if RFI manipulation alters other physiological and behavioral rhythms, we implanted mice with telemeters and tracked the body temperature, physical activity, and number of water bottle licks (interpreted as drinking behavior) (Figures 1D–1F and S1C–S1E). Body temperature continued to exhibit normal daily oscillations in AR and LB mice and was significantly decreased by ∼1°C during the day in NR mice, potentially due to the lack of feeding during the rest phase, as shown in other studies (Damiola et al., 2000Damiola F. Le Minh N. Preitner N. Kornmann B. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Restricted feeding uncouples circadian oscillators in peripheral tissues from the central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus., Satoh et al., 2006Satoh Y. Kawai H. Kudo N. Kawashima Y. Mitsumoto A. Time-restricted feeding entrains daily rhythms of energy metabolism in mice.) (Figures 1D and S1C). Physical activity and drinking behavior were not affected by changes in RFI and continued to exhibit robust oscillations across the 24-h day (Figures 1E, 1F, S1D, and S1E). Thus, mice fed AR remain behaviorally rhythmic and still exhibit a rhythmic drive to feed when active at night, indicating that we uncoupled the rhythm of food intake from other rhythmic behaviors in AR-fed mice.RFI is a potent cue for synchronizing circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues (Damiola et al., 2000Damiola F. Le Minh N. Preitner N. Kornmann B. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Restricted feeding uncouples circadian oscillators in peripheral tissues from the central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus., Izumo et al., 2014Izumo M. Pejchal M. Schook A.C. Lange R.P.

Pulivarthy S.R. Le H.D. Panda S. Time of feeding and the intrinsic circadian clock drive rhythms in hepatic gene expression.). To determine if manipulation of RFI alters the rhythmic hepatic transcriptome, we collected the livers of mice fed for 5 weeks under the three different feeding paradigms in LD12:12 every 4 h for 24 h and sequenced 3′ mRNA (n = 3 per paradigm and time point). Genome-wide analysis of rhythmic gene expression, performed using four independent statistical programs (see STAR Methods for details), revealed that the number of rhythmically expressed genes under each feeding paradigm correlates with the amplitude of RFI (Figure 2A; Table S1). However, rhythmically expressed genes exhibit a relatively poor overlap between each feeding paradigm, with ∼1,600 and 500 genes found to be uniquely rhythmically expressed under NR and AR feeding, respectively (Figure 2B).Figure 2Manipulation of RFI Impairs Rhythmic Gene Expression in the Mouse LiverShow full caption(A) Number of rhythmically expressed genes in the liver of mice fed AR (red), LB (black), or only at night (NR; gray). See STAR Methods for details about the statistical analysis.(B) Overlap of rhythmically expressed genes among the three feeding paradigms.(C) Top: averaged food eaten profile. Shading represents the SEM. Bottom: heatmap of standardized expression for four categories: RRR (genes rhythmic in NR-, LB-, and AR-fed mice; 324 genes), RRA (genes rhythmic in NR- and LB-fed mice and arrhythmic in AR-fed mice; 555 genes), RAA (genes rhythmic in NR-fed mice only; 1,674 genes), and AAR (genes rhythmic in AR-fed mice only; 495 genes). Data for each column are grouped by time point (n = 3 per time point) and plotted from left to right by increasing time point starting at ZT2. Rows are sorted according to the peak phase in LB (RRR and RRA), NR (RAA), or AR (AAR). Expression and averaged feeding data for the DR mice (dampened-rhythm of food intake; orange) are shown for comparison but were not considered for analysis.To characterize the contribution of RFI to the regulation of rhythmic gene expression in the mouse liver, we focused our analysis on the three major feeding paradigms (NR, LB, and AR; see STAR Methods for details). Genes were categorized into several groups: genes rhythmic in all three feeding paradigms (named RRR for rhythmic in NR, LB, and AR), genes whose decreased rhythmicity in gene expression parallels the decreased amplitude in RFI (genes rhythmically expressed in NR and LB, but not in AR, as well as genes rhythmic in NR only, named respectively RRA and RAA), and genes that are rhythmic in AR-fed mice only (named AAR). Genes rhythmic under all three feeding paradigms (RRR genes) maintained a similar phase of expression and only exhibited a small decrease in amplitude, suggesting that RFI does not contribute much to their transcription (Figures 2C and S2A–S2C). In contrast, genes in the RRA and RAA categories, which represent a large fraction of the expressed mouse liver transcriptome (n = 2,229 genes), showed a significant dampening in gene expression with a robust decrease in amplitude that parallels the decrease in RFI oscillation (Figures 2C and S2C). Phase analysis revealed that rhythmically expressed RRR, RRA, and RAA genes maintained a well-correlated phase of expression across the 24-h day, yet most rhythmic genes were consistently phase-advanced by 1–2 h in NR- and AR-fed mice when compared to LB-fed mice (Figures S2A and S2B). Genes in the AAR category displayed an increased rhythmicity and amplitude in gene expression that is inversely correlated with the amplitude of RFI oscillation. Many of the AAR genes peak at a uniform phase at the end of the night and/or beginning of the day in AR-fed mice, potentially indicating activation by a single pathway and/or transcription factor (Figure S2D). Pathway enrichment analysis indicates that AAR genes are involved in xenobiotic metabolism, response to infection, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure S2E). While the mechanisms underlying their rhythmic expression are unclear, we suspect that most AAR genes exhibit a peak of expression at the end of the night and/or beginning of the day in AR-fed mice in response to insufficient food intake at night compared to the physiological drive to feed. Taken together, these data indicate that the amplitude of RFI significantly contributes to the genome-wide oscillation in gene expression and that more than 70% of the cycling hepatic transcriptome under LB feeding lose rhythmicity in mice fed AR.Rhythmic gene expression in the mouse liver is thought to be mostly driven by the hepatic circadian clock in a cell-autonomous manner (Kornmann et al., 2007Kornmann B. Schaad O. Bujard H. Takahashi J.S. Schibler U. System-driven and oscillator-dependent circadian transcription in mice with a conditionally active liver clock., Lamia et al., 2008Lamia K.A. Storch K.F. Weitz C.J. Physiological significance of a peripheral tissue circadian clock., Vollmers et al., 2009Vollmers C. Gill S. DiTacchio L. Pulivarthy S.R. Le H.D. Panda S. Time of feeding and the intrinsic circadian clock drive rhythms in hepatic gene expression.). To determine if the hepatic molecular clock is responsible for the RFI-dependent decrease in rhythmic gene expression, we examined the expression of core clock genes. We found that all core clock genes were in the RRR category (Figures 3A and S3A; Table S2), thus suggesting that the core molecular clock in the liver is not affected by RFI manipulation and that it does not significantly contribute to the RFI-mediated changes in RRA and RAA gene expression.Figure 3RFI Drives Most Hepatic Rhythmic Gene Expression Independently of the Hepatic ClockShow full caption(A) Expression of the core clock genes Bmal1, Clock, Cry1, and Per1 in the liver of mice fed AR (red), LB (black), and only at night (NR; gray) (mean ± SEM; n = 3 per time point).(B) Standardized mouse liver gene expression for wild-type and Bmal1−/− mice fed only at night, derived from a public dataset (Atger et al., 2015Atger F. Gobet C. Marquis J. Martin E. Wang J. Weger B. Lefebvre G. Descombes P. Naef F. Gachon F. Circadian and feeding rhythms differentially affect rhythmic mRNA transcription and translation in mouse liver.). The RRR, RRA, and RRA categories are represented as in Figure 2C with the same number and ordering of genes (n = 4 per time point for wild-type mice, n = 2 per time point for Bmal1−/− mice).(C) Quantification of the median standardized expression for the RRR, RRA, and RAA categories at each time point, binned by 4-h windows of phase and shown for the ZT20–ZT24 bin. Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval. A figure including bins covering the 24-h day is provided as Figure S3B.(D) Cumulative distributions of log-transformed p values for differential rhythmicity in gene expression between AR and NR feeding paradigms (left) and between WT and Bmal1−/− backgrounds. p values were obtained from the HANOVA (ANOVA applied on harmonic regression) metric of DODR analysis (). The category AAA (arrhythmic gene expression in NR-, LB-, and AR-fed mice) is shown as background. The percentage of differentially rhythmic genes is displayed for each category to the right. Groups with different letters are significantly different (p &lt; 0.05; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).(E and F) Gene expression (mean ± SEM; n = 3 per timepoint) of four Bmal1 target genes rhythmically expressed in LB conditions yet showing differences in rhythmic expression in response to both feeding and clock function (E) or changes in feeding only (F).Based on these results, we hypothesized that the rhythmic expression of RRA and RAA genes is mostly driven by RFI, and that the 324 RRR genes are the only genes predominantly regulated by the hepatic clock. To test this hypothesis, we determined if clock-deficient mice fed only at night could maintain the rhythmic expression of RRA and RAA genes, but not RRR genes. To this end, we analyzed a public mouse liver RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset in which wild-type and Bmal1−/− mice were fed only at night (Atger et al., 2015Atger F. Gobet C. Marquis J. Martin E. Wang J. Weger B. Lefebvre G. Descombes P. Naef F. Gachon F. Circadian and feeding rhythms differentially affect rhythmic mRNA transcription and translation in mouse liver.). Visualization of gene expression revealed that most RRR genes lose rhythmicity in Bmal1−/− mice, confirming that RRR genes rely on a functional clock for rhythmic expression (Figure 3B). Interestingly, RRR genes peaking at the end of the night and/or beginning of the day in wild-type mice become constitutively expressed at high levels in Bmal1−/− mice, whereas those peaking at the end of the day/beginning of the night become constitutively expressed at low levels (Figures 3B and S3B). These results are consistent with direct transcriptional control by CLOCK:BMAL1, which binds DNA more potently in the middle of the day and whose direct target genes exhibit a similar pattern of expression in Bmal1−/− mice (). On the other hand, visualization of RRA and RAA genes in the liver of Bmal1−/− mice fed only at night revealed that most of these genes are expressed rhythmically, indicating that their rhythmic expression is driven by RFI and not by the hepatic clock (Figures 3B and 3C). Quantification of standardized gene expression binned by phase confirmed these results; RRR genes exhibit strong effects in median gene expression in response to Bmal1 knockout, but not to changes in RFI amplitude, whereas, conversely, RAA genes (and to a lesser extent RRA genes) show little to no response in Bmal1−/− mice but exhibit strong effects under manipulation of RFI (Figures 3C and S3B).To further unveil the relative contribution of the hepatic clock versus RFI in initiating rhythmic gene expression in the mouse liver, we performed a statistical analysis of differential rhythmicity using the detection of differential rhythmicity (DODR) program (). Comparison of rhythmic expression between NR-fed and AR-fed mice revealed that most genes in the RRA and RAA categories are affected by RFI manipulation and that the RRR genes were less affected (Figure 3D). However, the effects of RFI on RRR genes were significantly higher than background (calculated using genes arrhythmically expressed in all three feeding paradigms [AAA]), indicating that rhythmic expression of clock-controlled genes is still partially affected by RFI. Analysis of differential rhythmicity between wild-type and Bmal1−/− mice fed only at night also confirmed that genes in the RRR category were more affected by the disruption of molecular clock than genes in the RRA and RAA categories, which are at a level very close to that of the background and barely affected by Bmal1 knockout. Interestingly, genes whose rhythmic expression is preferentially regulated by RFI rather than by the clock (DODR NR- versus AR-fed mice, p ≤ 0.05; DODR wild-type versus Bmal1−/− mice, p &gt; 0.05) exhibit a phase distribution in NR-fed Bmal1−/− mice that is well correlated with the phase distribution in NR-fed wild-type mice yet globally phase-advanced by 1–2 h (Figure S3C). This suggests that feeding time alone can set the phase distribution of a large fraction of the cycling transcriptome in a clock-deficient mouse similarly to the phase distribution observed in a wild-type mouse and that the circadian clock delays the RFI-driven distribution of rhythmic gene expression by 1–2 h. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the rhythmicity of most genes in the mouse liver is predominantly driven by the rhythm of food intake and that the rhythmicity of only a few hundred genes is directly controlled by the cell-autonomous hepatic clock.Results from the analyses of differential rhythmicity prompted us to identify rhythmic genes regulated by RFI, the hepatic clock, or both. As expected, almost all core clock genes were affected by Bmal1 knockout, but not by RFI manipulation, confirming that the molecular clock oscillations are resilient to changes in RFI amplitude (Figures 3D and S3A). However, this was not the case for Per1 and Per2, which are the entry point for the entrainment of mammalian circadian clocks (Albrecht et al., 2001Albrecht U. Zheng B. Larkin D. Sun Z.S. Lee C.C. MPer1 and mper2 are essential for normal resetting of the circadian clock., Maywood et al., 1999Maywood E.S. Mrosovsky N. Field M.D. Hastings M.H. Rapid down-regulation of mammalian period genes during behavioral resetting of the circadian clock., Shearman et al., 1997Shearman L.P. Zylka M.J. Weaver D.R. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Reppert S.M. Two period homologs: circadian expression and photic regulation in the suprachiasmatic nuclei.). Per1 rhythmic expression was not affected by the molecular clock disruption or RFI manipulation and continued to oscillate normally in both NR-fed Bmal1−/− mice and AR-fed wild-type mice (Figures 3A and S3A). Per2 rhythmic expression was only affected by RFI manipulation, with decreased amplitude and a phase advance of 2.8 h from LB (Figure S3A), which is consistent with reports showing that Per2 expression is driven by systemic signals and not by the hepatic clock (Kornmann et al., 2007Kornmann B. Schaad O. Bujard H. Takahashi J.S. Schibler U. System-driven and oscillator-dependent circadian transcription in mice with a conditionally active liver clock.). In addition, examination of four known BMAL1 target genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes showed that their rhythmic expression in the liver, which is assumed to driven by the hepatic clock, relies on RFI (Doi et al., 2010Doi R. Oishi K. Ishida N. CLOCK regulates circadian rhythms of hepatic glycogen synthesis through transcriptional activation of Gys2., Hatanaka et al., 2010Hatanaka F. Matsubara C. Myung J. Yoritaka T. Kamimura N. Tsutsumi S. Kanai A. Suzuki Y. Sassone-Corsi P. Aburatani H. et al.Genome-wide profiling of the core clock protein BMAL1 targets reveals a strict relationship with metabolism., , Ramsey et al., 2009Ramsey K.M. Yoshino J. Brace C.S. Abrassart D. Kobayashi Y. Marcheva B. Hong H.K. Chong J.L. Buhr E.D. Lee C. et al.Circadian clock feedback cycle through NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis.) (Figures 3E and 3F). Interestingly, the rhythmic expression of Gys2 and Nampt is also impaired in NR-fed Bmal1−/− mice, indicating that their rhythmic expression is controlled by both the hepatic clock and RFI (Figure 3E). However, Cpt1a and Alas1 continue to cycle with similar phases and amplitudes in NR-fed Bmal1−/− mice, suggesting that their rhythmic expression is driven by RFI and not the hepatic clock despite being CLOCK:BMAL1 target genes (Figure 3F).The cell-autonomous hepatic clock is thought to drive rhythmic gene expression to temporally separate incompatible biochemical and metabolic processes (). Our findings that the rhythmic expression of several rate-limiting enzymes, which were thought to be directly regulated by the hepatic clock, actually relies on the rhythm of food intake prompted us to examine at the genome-wide level the genes and pathways that are regulated by RFI, the hepatic clock, or both. Remarkably, many metabolic pathways known to be rhythmic in the mouse liver were found to be regulated by RFI (Abbondante et al., 2016Abbondante S. Eckel-Mahan K.L. Ceglia N.J. Baldi P. Sassone-Corsi P. Comparative circadian metabolomics reveal differential effects of nutritional challenge in the serum and liver., Eckel-Mahan et al., 2012Eckel-Mahan K.L. Patel V.R. Mohney R.P. Vignola K.S. Baldi P. Sassone-Corsi P. Coordination of the transcriptome and metabolome by the circadian clock.) (Figure 4A; Table S3). Many of them are involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and include, for example, cholesterol and glycogen synthesis. This therefore suggests that RFI may contribute to the temporal coordination of metabolic pathways in the mouse liver without affecting the hepatic clock.Figure 4RFI Contributes to the Timing of Metabolic and Signaling Pathways Independently of the Hepatic ClockShow full caption(A) Pathway enrichment for the RRR, RRA, and RAA genes (see Figure 2C) based on whether their rhythmic expression is significantly affected by Bmal1 knockout, RFI manipulation, or both.(B) Blood glucose levels at 6 time points (n = 12 mice per feeding paradigm; mean ± SEM).(C) Blood glucose levels before injection of insulin (t = 0) and every 30 min after injection (mean ± SEM; n = 12 per feeding paradigm). 10 out of the 12 AR-fed mice were catatonic at t = 90 and rescued with an injection of 20% glucose (see STAR Methods).(D) Hepatic glycogen levels (n = 3 per feeding paradigm and time point; mean ± SEM; two-way ANOVA interaction p value).

Kalsbeek A. Wortel J. Buijs R.M. A suprachiasmatic nucleus generated rhythm in basal glucose concentrations.). We found that AR-fed mice exhibit an inverted rhythm in blood glucose levels when compared to NR-fed mice (Figure 4B). Since responses to boluses of insulin or glucose are also clock controlled (la Fleur et al., 2001la Fleur S.E. Kalsbeek A. Wortel J. Fekkes M.L. Buijs R.M. A daily rhythm in glucose tolerance: a role for the suprachiasmatic nucleus.), we performed an insulin tolerance test (ITT) at ZT2, i.e., when blood glucose levels are similar among the three groups and differences between groups cannot be confounded by differences in blood glucose levels prior to insulin injection. Surprisingly, AR-fed mice were insulin hypersensitive. 83% (10 of 12) mice displayed hypoglycemia and catatonia 90 min after insulin injection and had to be rescued by a glucose injection, whereas LB- and NR-fed mice recovered with minimal problems (Figure 4C). Because the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen synthesis (glycogen synthase or Gys2) is arrhythmically expressed in AR-fed mice (Ishikawa and Shimazu, 1976Daily rhythms of glycogen synthetase and phosphorylase activities in rat liver: influence of food and light., Zani et al., 2013Zani F. Breasson L. Becattini B. Vukolic A. Montani J.P. Albrecht U. Provenzani A. Ripperger J.A. Solinas G. PER2 promotes glucose storage to liver glycogen during feeding and acute fasting by inducing Gys2 PTG and G L expression.) (Figure 3F), we examined whether the hypersensitivity to insulin in AR-fed mice may be due to abnormal reserves of glycogen, resulting in impaired restoration of circulating blood glucose levels following insulin injection. Quantification of hepatic glycogen revealed that the rhythm of glycogen levels in the liver is dampened in AR-fed mice (Figure 4D). Examination of the rhythmic expression of glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl), which codes for the enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown in the liver, revealed that both catabolism and anabolism of glycogen is affected by RFI (Figures 4E and 4F). In addition, the expression of Glut2 (aka Slc2a2), the main glucose transporter in hepatocytes, also shows a phase advance of 5.2 h from LB, suggesting that the availability of cellular glucose is shifted under AR feeding (Leturque et al., 2005Leturque A. Brot-Laroche E. Le Gall M. Stolarczyk E. Tobin V. The role of GLUT2 in dietary sugar handling.) (Figure 4G). The expression of the glucose transporter Glut4 (aka Slc2a4), which is found primarily in adipose tissues and striated muscle, is also strongly upregulated at the light:dark transition in the liver of AR-fed mice () (Figure 4G).Considering the possibility that intracellular glucose may be repurposed through lipogenesis instead of glycogenesis, we inspected the expression of rate-limiting lipogenic enzymes (Figure 4E) and found that their expression was strongly impaired under AR feeding. While they are rhythmically transcribed with a peak at the end of the night in LB- and NR-fed mice, their expression is arrhythmic and almost out-of-phase in AR-fed mice (Figure 4H). Importantly, expression of the master lipogenic transcription factor Srebf1 and its co-regulator, Insig1, is also phase advanced in AR-fed mice, suggesting that glycogenesis and lipogenesis occur simultaneously in AR-fed mice, whereas they normally occur sequentially in the liver of rhythmically fed mice (Figure 4I). Further investigation of the glycogenesis and lipogenesis pathways also revealed that paralog genes with similar rhythmic expression profiles in ad-libitum-fed mice exhibit a different response to RFI manipulation, i.e., only one of the two paralogs becomes arrhythmically expressed in AR-fed mice (Figures 4J and S4A). This feature, which includes genes involved in fatty acid elongation (Elovl3 and Elovl6), regulation of glycogen synthesis (Ppp1r3b and Ppp1r3c), and response to insulin (Insig1 and Insig2), further suggests that disruption of RFI can strongly impair the temporal organization of metabolic processes despite a functional cell-autonomous hepatic clock (Figures 4J and S4A).To get insights into the mechanisms underlying the loss of rhythmic gene expression in AR-fed mice, we investigated the rhythmic activity of two major signaling pathways implicated in metabolism, mTOR and ERK1 and Erk2. While the total levels of mTOR and ERK1 and Erk2 proteins remains constant under all three feeding paradigms, we found that the rhythmic activation of these proteins via phosphorylation is strongly impaired in AR-fed mice (Figure 4K). Specifically, while the activity of ERK1, ERK2, and mTOR pathways are almost antiphasic in LB- and NR-fed mice, they occur coincidently throughout the 24-h day in AR-fed mice (Figure 4K). This suggests that the downstream targets of the mTOR, and ERK1 and ERK2 pathways, which include several metabolic transcription factors, may contribute to the loss of rhythmic gene expression in the livers of AR-fed mice. Taken together, our findings thus indicate that alteration in the rhythm of feeding can lead to observable changes in signaling and metabolic pathways without affecting the circadian clock (Figure 4L).We have demonstrated that RFI drives the majority of rhythms in hepatic gene expression and contributes to the timing of signaling and metabolic pathways independently of the cell-autonomous molecular clock. It remains unknown, however, if the effects mediated by AR feeding on glucose metabolism and lipogenesis are independent of the hepatic circadian clock or if they originate from a desynchronization between clock-driven and RFI-driven rhythmic gene expression. Nevertheless, our findings that most of the rhythmic hepatic transcriptome is controlled by signals that originate from the SCN-driven rhythm of food intake rather than by the cell-autonomous hepatic clock raise the possibility that the contribution of RFI to rhythmic gene expression extends to other tissues and that other SCN-driven cues may also participate in driving peripheral rhythmic gene expression. Our data also suggest that the master circadian clock in the SCN does not act solely to synchronize peripheral circadian clocks but instead contributes more generally to circadian transcriptional programs body-wide.Reports that liver- and other tissue-specific clock-deficient mice exhibit substantial dysregulation of rhythmic gene expression and recapitulate some of the phenotypes observed in whole-body clock-deficient mice, yet continue to eat rhythmically, indicate that clock-driven and RFI-driven transcriptional programs are likely intertwined. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, they may include the regulation of nutrients uptake from the portal vein or secretion of metabolites by the hepatic clock, further leading to an interdependent relationship between RFI and the cell-autonomous clock that helps maintain organismal health (Kornmann et al., 2007Kornmann B. Schaad O. Bujard H. Takahashi J.S. Schibler U. System-driven and oscillator-dependent circadian transcription in mice with a conditionally active liver clock., Lamia et al., 2008Lamia K.A. Storch K.F. Weitz C.J. Physiological significance of a peripheral tissue circadian clock.). Finally, disruption of the clock has been shown to have far-reaching effects on aging and response to therapeutics, among others (Gorbacheva et al., 2005Gorbacheva V.Y. Kondratov R.V. Zhang R. Cherukuri S. Gudkov A.V. Takahashi J.S. Antoch M.P. Circadian sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide depends on the functional status of the CLOCK/BMAL1 transactivation complex., Kondratov et al., 2006Kondratov R.V. Kondratova A.A. Gorbacheva V.Y. Vykhovanets O.V. Antoch M.P. Early aging and age-related pathologies in mice deficient in BMAL1, the core componentof the circadian clock.). Our findings indicate that these effects could potentially be ameliorated through control of RFI, introducing an aspect of chronotherapy not yet explored.",https://t.co/3mBNP5HW0P,others
Pushing diabetics to take insulin is a medical scam: Fiona Godlee,"Fiona Godlee, the first woman editor of the BMJ (originally called the British Medical Journal), is no ivory-tower academic. A crusader for medical ethics, Godlee is known for blasting governments for being lax, taking on global pharma giants such as Roche and GlaxoSmithKline for reportedly hiding trial data, speaking fearlessly against corruption in science, and championing the cause of patient-centric healthcare. In India to attend the BMJ South Asia Awards 2016, Godlee talks to Economic Times on a wide range of issues, from air pollution to corruption in medicine and the work that the BMJ does in the country. Edited excerpts: How does it feel to breathe the most polluted air in India? (Laughs) I love this country. It's a wonderful place and am coming back here after two years. The air now looks a lot better from what I read and saw a few days back. To look at the positive side of things, air pollution is back on the agenda of the people. You have to make the public aware and the governments accountable for moving us away from burning fossil fuel. Your recent report reveals that most of the people with diabetes in India are largely dependent on foreign-made insulin, which is expensive… There are certain things which are not going right. To put patients on insulin is a big push by industry and the doctors who in turn are influenced by the industry. Rather than tackling the lifestyle issues, going straight to insulin is not the right option. That is a big worry because insulin is not without its harm and is expensive in India. I think it's a medical scam, an industry scam. Patients think that this is the best drug for them, and they need to pay for it or else they would die, and a very big group of people are vulnerable to it. I think we need to speak out against the pressure to put people on insulin. With diabetes becoming such an epidemic in India, we need to look at the root causes and put money there rather than putting people on insulin. Is there a parallel in terms of rising caesarean births in India rather than normal delivery? Caesarean births are a problem globally, and not just in India. It's more convenient for the doctor, who also gets paid more, and people are encouraged to think it's safer. In some cases, it may be true but not in all cases. It's not a riskfree procedure: anaesthetics, surgery, medical cost, long time of recovery and even more difficulty in having subsequent babies. It's a global issue. What's your take on corruption in medicine? Again, it is a global phenomenon, not just confined to India. There's corruption in medicine globally. But if you have a system where doctors are paid more to do more, then you are going to end up with a system which seems to reward that kind of behaviour. If so, then it's going to get much more likely that doctors would tend to push more for surgery, for investigations… kickbacks encourage more such behaviour. And, on the positive side, there are doctors in India who have started speaking against this. Consumer activism too is missing in India… That may be the case. Consumer activism is a huge potential benefit if we can harness it in a big way. We need to educate people that more is not better, more medicine can be worse. They need to ask questions, take second opinion, ask about the benefits of treatment. The same thing can be done regarding air pollution. Awareness has to be created. Hard questions need to be asked. There needs to be a cultural shift where doctors and patients are much like partners. You first came to India in the early 1990s. In terms of the medical ecosystem, what has changed in India since then? The biggest change is exceptional tertiary care, which even puts the rest of the world to shame. Many countries in the world would be surprised to see the kind of expertise that doctors have here. The second big change is highvolume, high-quality medical care, which is again startling. And what has failed to change? Lack of quality primary care is the biggest concern. With money and energy spent in tertiary medical care, it requires strong political intervention to create infrastructure for primary healthcare. You need to give incentives to young doctors and nurses to work in the primary healthcare system. The pressure that doctors work under has also not changed. Any other medical trend that you have noticed in India? The breakdown of the doctor-patient relationship is disturbing. There have been reports where doctors have been abused and assaulted. It is happening in China as well. There's an unrealistic expectation from medicines and doctors. But there are other issues as well. We are overpromising in terms of offering treatment. Then there are issues about patients taking loans to meet medical expenses. There have been reports of people selling assets and getting bankrupt. These are awful decisions that people have to make. Can drug price control make healthcare more affordable? The government in India has been doing something to bring price control in drug treatment. That's the issue right across the world where drugs are hugely overpriced. Drug companies, for their part, say that they have to recover research and development costs. Since the markup is huge, we need to incentivise drug companies to behave in a different way. The problem of drug pricing is more apparent in India because people are paying themselves.",https://t.co/QXhZpfbIzL,others
"The Three-Month Effects of a Ketogenic Diet on Body Composition, Blood Parameters, and Performance Metrics in CrossFit Trainees: A Pilot Study.","Adopting low carbohydrate, ketogenic diets remains a controversial issue for individuals who resistance train given that this form of dieting has been speculated to reduce skeletal muscle glycogen levels and stifle muscle anabolism. We sought to characterize the effects of a 12-week ketogenic diet (KD) on body composition, metabolic, and performance parameters in participants who trained recreationally at a local CrossFit facility. Twelve participants (nine males and three females, 31 ± 2 years of age, 80.3 ± 5.1 kg body mass, 22.9 ± 2.3% body fat, 1.37 back squat: body mass ratio) were divided into a control group (CTL; n = 5) and a KD group (n = 7). KD participants were given dietary guidelines to follow over 12 weeks while CTL participants were instructed to continue their normal diet throughout the study, and all participants continued their CrossFit training routine for 12 weeks. Pre, 2.5-week, and 12-week anaerobic performance tests were conducted, and pre- and 12-week tests were performed for body composition using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and ultrasound, resting energy expenditure (REE), blood-serum health markers, and aerobic capacity. Additionally, blood beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were measured weekly. Blood BHB levels were 2.8- to 9.5-fold higher in KD versus CTL throughout confirming a state of nutritional ketosis. DXA fat mass decreased by 12.4% in KD (p = 0.053). DXA total lean body mass changes were not different between groups, although DXA dual-leg lean mass decreased in the KD group by 1.4% (p = 0.068), and vastus lateralis thickness values decreased in the KD group by ~8% (p = 0.065). Changes in fasting glucose, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were similar between groups, although LDL cholesterol increased ~35% in KD (p = 0.048). Between-group changes in REE, one-repetition maximum (1-RM) back squat, 400 m run times, and VO2peak were similar between groups. While our n-sizes were limited, these preliminary data suggest that adopting a ketogenic diet causes marked reductions in whole-body adiposity while not impacting performance measures in recreationally-trained CrossFit trainees. Whether decrements in dual-leg muscle mass and vastus lateralis thickness in KD participants were due to fluid shifts remain unresolved, and increased LDL-C in these individuals warrants further investigation.",https://t.co/OTO70roHk4,others
Flaxseed for Diabetes and Prediabetes,"Flaxseeds may be a beneficial dietary supplement for managing diabetes or prediabetes. More specifically, in helping reduce insulin resistance, improve cholesterol and decrease belly fat.Yes, although these tiny seeds may be small in size, research shows the health benefits of flaxseeds are fairly enormous!Read on to discover more about them.JUMP TO: What is flaxseed | Nutrition facts for flaxseed | How do flaxseeds improve health | Insulin resistance and blood sugar | Cholesterol | Prediabetes | How to use flaxseedWhat is Flaxseed?Flaxseeds (also known as linseeds) are small edible seeds derived from a flowering plant native to India and the Mediterranean, but it is now cultivated in North America and various other parts of the world as well.There are three flaxseed products that you may come across in your local grocery market or health food store: whole flaxseeds, ground flax (flaxseed meal), and flaxseed oil.Flaxseed oil often comes in capsule form and is a great way to consume omega-3 fatty acids, especially if you're vegetarian and can't stand the thought of fish oil.Whole flaxseeds may improve your digestion, but they aren't ideal since they pass through your gastrointestinal tract largely undigested, though they still do produce a gel-like fiber.However, if you want to reap the full benefits of flaxseeds then you'll want to get ground flaxseeds (flaxseed meal) – this is the seeds broken down into a dense powder, which makes the nutritional components much easier to digest and absorb.Nutrition Facts for FlaxseedHere's what you'll find in 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed:Calories: 37Fat: 3 gProtein: 1.3 gCarbohydrates: 2 gDietary fiber: 1.9 gOmega-3s (in the form of alpha-linoleic acid): 2,112 mgMagnesium: 10% RDAVitamin B1: 10% RDAManganese: 12% RDAWhen it comes to flaxseed oil supplements the amount of omega-3s will vary between brands. However, the following label for generic flaxseed oil shows that one capsule contains 700 mg of omega-3s in the form of alpha linoleic acid (ALA).It also contains some omega-6 and omega-9 fats, but compared to omega-3s, these are less important, as the typical Western diet is often greatly lacking in omega-3s.Taking a supplement may be the most convenient way to get your omega-3s, but consuming ground flax gives you the added bonus of more dietary fiber (1.9 g per tablespoon!), as well as the vitamins and minerals you won't get from a capsule.How Do Flaxseeds Improve Your Health?As you just read, flaxseeds are high in fiber. Flax fibers include both soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, the proportion of soluble to insoluble fiber varying between 20:80 and 40:60.Insoluble fiber helps improve digestion and prevent constipation, while soluble fiber helps in maintaining blood glucose levels and lowering blood cholesterol levels.In addition, the omega-3 fatty acids found in flaxseeds have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects inside the body, working to dampen systemic inflammation and scavenge free radicals that are associated with health conditions such as diabetes and prediabetes.The ALA in omega-3-rich flaxseed oil also has hypoglycemic (blood sugar lowering) and hypolipidemic (blood cholesterol lowering) effects.Insulin Resistance and Blood GlucoseThere is quite a substantial amount of research showing that flaxseeds can improve insulin resistance. This is great news since insulin resistance can be a major underlying problem faced by most people with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.A 2017 study found that mice with artificially induced insulin resistance experienced great improvements when given ALA-rich flaxseed oil.These insulin-sensitizing effects have also been seen in many human studies.One study administered daily doses of ALA to obese patients with insulin resistance for 8 weeks. The researchers reported that the patients had decreased insulin levels and lower levels of insulin resistance. The patients also experienced lower levels of inflammation and reductions in triglycerides.Another study found that flaxseed powder supplementation (10 g/day for 1 month) resulted in reduced fasting blood glucose (-19.7%) and A1C levels (-15.6%) among type 2 diabetics.A product called flaxseed gum has also been shown to lower fasting blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes, from 154 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l) to 136 mg/dl (7.6 mmol/l) over a three month period, a reduction of 18 mg/dl (1 mmol/l).Please pin, tweet or share; then keep on reading.Back to topCholesterol and LipidsResearch has shown that flaxseeds have a favorable effect on cholesterol and blood lipids in those who have elevated levels.In one study, people with type 2 diabetes who consumed 5 g of flaxseed gum every day experienced a significant drop in both total cholesterol (from 182 mg/dl to 163 mg/dl) and LDL cholesterol (110 mg/dl to 92 mg/dl).Other studies have found that supplementing 10 g/day of flaxseed powder produced reductions in total cholesterol (-14.3%), triglycerides (-17.5%), and LDL cholesterol (-21.8%) among people with type 2 diabetes.PreDiabetes Flax seeds are also a great supplement for anyone who is trying to treat their prediabetes naturally.A study on prediabetes found that supplementing with 13 g of ground flaxseed daily for 12 weeks resulted in decreased glucose and insulin levels, as well as improved insulin sensitivity.In people with metabolic syndrome, supplementing with 25 mL/ day of flaxseed oil was shown to reduce total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, along with decreasing blood pressure.In another study of people with metabolic syndrome people were given 30 g/ day of ground flaxseed alongside active lifestyle advice, central belly fat was reduced by 36% compared to just 13% in those only given active lifestyle advice. The flaxseed group also had a reduction in insulin resistance.How to Use FlaxseedNow that you're familiar with all the potential health benefits of flaxseeds, how can you incorporate them into your life?Flaxseed oil capsules are perfect for increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce body-wide inflammation. Another great use for capsules is to decrease hunger.If you're finding you're eating a substantial meal but not getting that feeling of satisfaction, try including 2 flaxseed capsules with at least two of your meals each day. Animal studies have shown that supplementing with ALA increases the satiety (fullness) hormone leptin by around 10%. And we've been using this method with clients and it does seem to work.Other than taking a flaxseed oil capsule, ground flaxseed can be used in baking or mixed into foods you already know and love! Here are a few ideas for enjoying flaxseeds in your diet:Ground flaxseeds pair well with other low carb flours in recipes for muffins, crackers, pie crusts, and breadsFlax can also be found in store bought products like low carb cereals, or add it to a homemade low carb nut muesli for added fiberA combination of ground flaxseed and water can replace eggs in a pinch while bakingMix ground flax into Greek yogurt for some added fiberAdd one to three tablespoons of ground flax to your favorite smoothie and blend wellFlaxseeds have ample health benefits and make a great addition to any diabetic diet!Please pin, tweet or share this info to help others – thanks!

Inside the office: pros & cons of injecting insulin,"For some, an insulin pump is the best for their diabetes therapy. For others, an insulin pump is an annoying attachment, and they'd rather not bother. Everyone's preferences and priorities are different, which makes sense. To each our own, right? As our friend Bennet famously says, your diabetes may vary!Here in the mySugr office, we posed the question to a few of the people with diabetes on our team. It's interesting to hear why someone prefers injecting with a pen/syringe, or why someone else would defend their pump to the very end.If you're struggling to decide, maybe some of the answers we got from the team will help! Let's start with ""Team Pen"":What are the most significant benefits of injecting for you?Lisa – Marketing InternLisa:I don't have to wear anything on my body.It's super simple and easy.And diabetes isn't so dominant in my mind – there's no constant reminder attached to me.Jan – Data ScientistJan:I don't like carrying things in my pockets, and I think that most insulin pumps today are still too big.If I could control the insulin pump directly with my phone, I might change my mind.Adi (QA Lead):The pen is more comfortable for me. I played soccer at a professional level, and I didn't want to worry about anything attached to me. I still feel the same even though I'm not playing professionally anymore.I feel safer with the pen because I'm less dependent on technology.I find insulin pens more discreet because they're not always visible.Is there anything you don't like about injecting your insulin?Lisa:Keeping the insulin cool in the summer is sometimes tedious.Jan:I wish I had an insulin calculator for pens. With the pump that would be easier because it's built-in. But the mySugr app helps with that (the mySugr app features an insulin calculator module that's approved for use in Europe).Adi:Sometimes I forget to inject because I think I already did it.Especially when on vacation, I have to worry about keeping my insulin at a safe temperature.It can be annoying to do a separate injection for everything. Meal? Poke. Snack? Poke. High BG? Poke.Are there any situations where you especially appreciate using injections?Lisa:I think it's great that I can always discreetly store my insulin pen in my purse. That gives me a feeling of freedom!Jan:It's easy to forget whether I've injected or not, so I really like the memory function of my pen.Adi:As a pen user, I can easily buy the supplies. That gives me a sense of independence – whether on vacation or at home.I find it very helpful not having to disconnect anything when I want to exercise or play sports.Wrapping upLike everything in life, Pen therapy has its advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, your therapy decision is something very personal. Fortunately, we have options and can make choices!What about you? What do you prefer? Pen or pump? Did anything here hit home for you? We'd love to hear more about it!Next week we'll dive into the pros and cons of using an insulin pump from a few more in the mySugr monster pack. Stay tuned!",https://t.co/UY7f6goITD,others
Aging is associated with myocardial insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction,"advanced age is associated with the development of whole body insulin resistance and increased incidence of type 2 diabetes in humans (4, 9, 14, 33). Aging is also frequently accompanied by obesity and inactivity that predispose to the development of insulin resistance (6, 16, 17, 32, 39). However, it is unclear what independent role aging plays in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in the absence of obesity and inactivity. Furthermore, it is unclear as to whether these abnormalities in insulin action extend to the senescent myocardium, where continuous contractile function makes inactivity less relevant.Recently, skeletal muscle insulin resistance in both advanced age (1, 28) and in lean offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes (10, 22, 29) was associated with altered mitochondrial protein expression (28) and density (10). These abnormalities were seen in association with increased intracellular lipid accumulation (22, 28, 29). However, it is unknown whether these same alterations are evident in the senescent myocardium, whether they are associated with altered insulin action, and whether they predispose to altered left ventricle (LV) hemodynamics in the absence of hyperglycemia or other conventional risk factors.Accordingly, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether aging alone was associated with both whole body and myocardial insulin resistance, independent of obesity and inactivity. A second goal was to determine whether myocardial insulin resistance is associated with LV, systemic, or coronary hemodynamic abnormalities. A third goal was to determine the cellular mechanisms responsible for myocardial insulin resistance with advanced age. Finally, we sought to determine the role of altered mitochondrial content and function in the pathogenesis of myocardial insulin resistance. We chose the model of senescent beagles as a well-characterized, large-animal model of aging. Specifically, senescent beagles have been utilized to investigate age-related alterations in myocardial contractility (10), coronary and ventricular remodeling (35), and response to exercise (11, 12) independent of the influence of atherosclerosis.METHODSAcclimationTwenty-four male dogs, all of which had a beagle background and weighed between 14 and 18 kg, were either classified as young (Y, aged 3–4 yr) or old (O, 10–12 yr) by the vendor. The veterinary staff confirmed the ages through dental examinations. The dogs were carefully screened for all disease known to occur commonly in canines bred for research by using laboratory and radiological studies. These included at least three samples for heart worms. In addition, at the time of euthanasia, a formal autopsy was performed to ascertain whether there were any clinically undetected diseases such as cancer.The animals were acclimated to the research laboratory for 6 wk before instrumentation. During the acclimation period, they were fed a standard chow once daily with a fixed carbohydrate and fat content. In addition, the dogs underwent a supervised exercise regimen on a treadmill each day for 30 min four times per week for 6 wk before surgery.InstrumentationAll dogs were instrumented as described previously by our laboratory (26, 27). The dogs were allowed to recover from the surgical procedure for 2 wk, during which time they were trained to lie quietly on the experimental table in a conscious, unrestrained state. Animals used in this study were maintained in accordance with the ""Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal Resources"" [DHHS Publication No. (NIH) 86–23, Revised 1996], and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Allegheny General Hospital.Experimental ProtocolHemodynamic measurements.Control experiments consisted of hemodynamic recordings to determine LV contractility (LV dP/dt), stroke volume, cardiac output, and coronary blood flow. Arterial (a) and coronary sinus (v) blood samples were obtained to calculate myocardial oxygen consumption (Mvo2) as the product of the left circumflex coronary artery blood flow and the myocardial arteriovenous O2 content difference.Metabolic determinations.Metabolic parameters were measured at 8 a.m., following an overnight fast. Transmyocardial substrate balance was calculated as the difference between arterial and coronary sinus content. Basal myocardial substrate uptake was calculated as the product of myocardial substrate balance and coronary blood flow (26, 27).The measurements of plasma norepinephrine, insulin, glucagon, adiponectin, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and glucose were carried out as described previously by our laboratory (26).In all dogs, whole body and myocardial insulin sensitivity were assessed in the baseline state by using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (26, 27). In the fasting state, a primed, constant infusion of insulin (480 pmol·m−2·min−1) was administered for 120 min to create a steady-state concentration of plasma insulin (∼1,000 pmol/l). Arterial glucose concentrations were measured every 5 min, and glucose was infused to maintain plasma glucose concentrations at 90 mg/dl ± 10%. Myocardial glucose and NEFA balance and coronary blood flow were sampled every 15 min to determine myocardial glucose and NEFA uptake.Cellular insulin signaling.Samples of LV myocardium and gracilis (skeletal) muscle from eight young and eight old dogs were obtained at the time of euthanasia under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (100 units regular insulin intravenously via the right atrial catheter). These samples were obtained within 2–3 h after the last hemodynamic measurements and clamp experiments were performed and when all parameters had returned to baseline. Briefly, under pentobarbital anesthesia, the chest was opened and the LV free wall was identified. Pledgeted stay sutures were placed, and a 5-g transmural section of LV free wall was excised, with hemostasis achieved by securing the sutures. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored to ensure hemodynamic stability. Simultaneously, another member of the team excised 5 g of gracilis muscle. Insulin was administered via the right atrial catheter, and after 2–4 min, a second sample of LV and gracilis muscle was excised before the entire heart was removed. Samples were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and were stored at −70°C. Purified sarcolemmal membranes were prepared by using sucrose-gradient centrifugation as described previously (34).LV myocardium was homogenized in a buffer free of phosphatase inhibitors and was subjected to electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE (19). Resolved proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) at a constant voltage (100 V) for 1–2 h at 4°C (37). Adjustments for protein loading were accomplished by normalizing bands on the basis of Coomassie staining of the blots (26).Polyclonal anti-insulin receptor-β subunit (IR-β) antibodies and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, monoclonal mouse anti-Akt-1, polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-Akt-1 (Ser473), and polyclonal rabbit anti-insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal anti-phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), polyclonal rabbit anti-glucose transporter GLUT4 and GLUT1 and protein A/G-PLUS agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal rabbit phospho-Akt-1 (Ser473) specificity was confirmed by using phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated NIH/3T3 cell extracts purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 followed by anti-phosphoserine (Ser307) Western blotting was performed with 200 μg of tissue lysate and was precleared with 0.05 μg normal rabbit IgG together with 20 μl of resuspended protein A/G PLUS-agarose by mixing for 2 h at 4°C. The immunocomplex was captured by adding 100 μl (25 μl packed beads) protein A/G-PLUS agarose and incubating at 4°C for at least 3 h. The supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed three times in ice-cold PBS followed by one wash with 0.5 M Tris·HCl, pH 6.8. Beads were resuspended in Laemmli buffer (19) and were boiled for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Data were expressed as the ratio of phosphoprotein to total protein. GLUT1 and GLUT4 translocation under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions was assessed by examining the ratio of membrane-associated GLUT4 to total (membrane and cytosolic) GLUT4. Sarcolemmal GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein levels were measured on purified membranes generated by using sucrose-gradient centrifugation as an established method for separating sarcolemmal from intracellular membrane components.The adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activity in the LV myocardium was determined as described previously (25). Activity was expressed as picomoles of incorporated ATP per milligram of protein per minute.Western blots to determine protein expression of components of the signaling pathway for fatty acid uptake [polyclonal rabbit fatty acid transporter (FAT)/CD36] and metabolism [polyclonal rabbit peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and PPARγ coactivator (PGC)-1α; Santa Cruz] were performed on cytosolic and purified preparations, respectively, by using methods described above.Mitochondrial isolation.Crude mitochondrial isolates were prepared from canine myocardium by using a trypsin-digestion procedure as described previously (26). The purity of the mitochondrial isolates was established by demonstrating the absence of Na+-K+-ATPase activity in mitochondrial preparations. The isolated mitochondrial samples from LV myocardium and gracilis muscle were resuspended to a final protein concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in a buffer at a final concentration of 125 mM Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 5% (vol/vol) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% (wt/vol) bromphenol blue. Membrane samples [5 μg/lane for uncoupling protein (UCP-3) and 2.5 μg/lane for succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase-1 (MCO1)] were subjected to electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE (24). Proteins resolved were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P) at a constant voltage (100 V) for 2 h at 4°C (37). Nonspecific membrane protein-binding sites were blocked for at least 1 h with 5% (wt/vol) dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (TTBS), and then membranes were probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-UCP-3 antibody (1:10,000; Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX), monoclonal mouse anti-SDHA antibody (1:100,000), or monoclonal mouse anti-MCO1 antibody (1:100,000; Abcam,Cambridge, MA), overnight at 4°C. The blots were washed three times in TTBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature in appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and then washed as before. The immunoreactive proteins were detected by use of an enhanced horseradish peroxidase/luminol chemiluminescence reaction kit (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and were exposed to X-ray film (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Densitometric analysis of the bands was carried out using a Personal Densitometer SI and ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Glycogen and fat staining.Samples of LV myocardium were fixed in formalin (2%) and were stained for glycogen content by using periodic acid-Schiff staining. Neutral lipid was identified by using osmium stain. Glycogen and fat content were quantified by using a MetaMorph imaging program and were expressed as volume percent myocardium.Transmission electron microscopy of myocardial and skeletal muscle.Tissue samples were placed in cold (4°C) 3% glutaraldehyde overnight. On the following day, samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 90 min, then dehydrated through graded ethanol and Acetonitrile. The sample was then infiltrated with one change of 50% propylene oxide, 50% epoxy resin for 2 h, and then pure epoxy resin for an additional 2 h before embedding. One-micron sections were cut and stained with methylene blue for light-microscopic examination. Thin sections were cut on a Reichert Om-U2 ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Philips CM-10 electron microscope at 60 kV.Statistical AnalysisData are expressed as the mean values ± SE. Differences in hemodynamic and metabolic responses between the groups were determined by two-way ANOVA. Where differences were detected over time, a post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test was performed to determine differences at respective time points. Differences in components of the insulin-signaling cascade, mitochondrial enzymes, intramyocardial lipids, and glycogen were compared by using a Student's t-test for unpaired data. A level of P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSThe Effects of Age on Body Mass Index and Metabolic ParametersTable 1 illustrates the effects of age on body mass index and metabolic parameters. There was no difference in body weight, body mass index, or abdominal girth between groups. Fasting plasma glucose levels were normal, whereas plasma insulin levels and NEFA levels were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in older dogs. There were no differences in plasma adiponectin or leptin levels. Notably, both plasma arterial norepinephrine and myocardial norepinephrine spillover were increased (P &lt; 0.01) in old dogs.Table 1.

There was a small increase in LV + septum weight, although the difference was not significant when normalized for body weight. There were no significant differences in LV systolic or end-diastolic pressures or LV dP/dt. Isovolumic relaxation was prolonged in older dogs compared with younger dogs. Older dogs had higher resting heart rates and mean arterial pressures but comparable cardiac outputs. However, there were significant reductions in LV stroke work and myocardial external efficiency in older dogs. Older dogs had higher basal coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption. LV dimensions were not different between groups (data not shown).Table 2.

Whole body glucose disposition was reduced in older dogs. These findings are consistent with impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposition. Figure 2 illustrates that that both basal and insulin-stimulated myocardial glucose uptake were reduced in older dogs, whereas basal myocardial NEFA uptake was increased. Hyperinsulinemia suppressed myocardial NEFA uptake and oxygen consumption to a greater extent in older dogs compared with younger dogs yet did not reduce Mvo2 to basal levels observed in the young dogs. Notably, the reduction in Mvo2 during the clamp was not associated with a significant change in heart rate or blood pressure, suggesting a relative shift in metabolic preference from NEFA to glucose.Fig. 1.Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in young (n = 12) vs. older (n = 12) dogs.

In cardiac muscle, there was decreased expression of insulin receptors and Akt protein abundance, whereas in skeletal muscle, there was increased Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 but no difference in insulin receptor or Akt protein expression. Notably, there was no difference in IRS-1 protein expression in either cardiac or skeletal muscle (data not shown). Figure 4 illustrates that there was diminished insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. This was seen in association with impaired GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin in both the skeletal and cardiac muscle from older dogs (Fig. 4). Although there was no age-related difference in basal cytosolic expression of GLUT1 [Y, 146 ± 23 density units (DU); O, 153 ± 47 DU], aging was associated with a marked decrease in sarcolemmal expression of GLUT1 (Y, 578 ± 46 DU; O, 233 ± 72 DU; P &lt; 0.01). GLUT1 translocation was not augmented by insulin administration.Fig. 3.Basal expression of proximal components of insulin-signaling cascade in cardiac and skeletal muscle from young (n = 8) and old (n-8) dogs.

There was no difference in AMPK activity between young and old dogs in either cardiac (Y, 3.24 ± 0.30 pmol ATP·mg−1·min−1; O, 3.11 ± 0.49 pmol ATP·mg−1·min−1) or skeletal muscle (Y, 2.12 ± 0.11 pmol ATP·mg−1·min−1; O, 2.01 ± 0.32 pmol ATP·mg−1·min−1). There was no increase in PGC-1α expression between groups in either cardiac (Y, 252 ± 23 DU; O, 264 ± 6 DU) or skeletal muscle (Y, 96 ± 10 DU; O, 86 ± 17 DU). There was no difference in PPARα expression in cardiac (Y, 425 ± 25 DU; O, 475 ± 116 DU) or skeletal (Y, 125 ± 25 DU; O, 75 ± 116 DU) muscle. However, FAT/CD36 expression in myocardial sarcolemmal membranes was significantly reduced in older dogs (Y, 1,312 ± 123 DU; O, 387 ± 12 DU; P &lt; 0.05), whereas there was no difference in skeletal muscle (Y, 212 ± 92 DU; O, 187 ± 54 DU).Figure 5 illustrates the effects of aging on myocardial mitochondrial structure and expression of mitochondrial proteins. There were no differences in the semiquantitative assessment of mitochondrial content in cardiac or skeletal muscle. The senescent myocardium was associated with increased vacuolization of mitochondria. These structural abnormalities were seen in association with decreased expression of UCP-3 in the senescent myocardium. In addition, MCO1 and SDHA were also diminished. These mitochondrial abnormalities were seen in association with increases in intramyocardial lipid deposition and decreased glycogen content (Fig. 6) in the senescent myocardium compared with younger dogs. In contrast, there was no difference in semiquantitative analysis of mitochondrial density or UCP-3, MCO1, or SDHA expression between young and old dogs in skeletal muscle samples (data not shown).Fig. 5.Transmission electron micrographs of myocardium from young (A, n = 7) and old dogs (B, n = 8). There was no difference in myocardial mitochondrial density, but there were decreases in mitochondrial protein expression including mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase-1 (MCOI), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3).

These abnormalities are seen in association with increases in plasma NEFA, increased myocardial NEFA uptake, and increases in myocardial oxygen consumption. Although both whole body and myocardial insulin resistance were observed in older dogs, there were distinct cellular abnormalities in insulin signaling in cardiac vs. skeletal muscle. Finally, myocardial insulin resistance is associated with altered mitochondrial structure seen in conjunction with decreased UCP-3 expression.Whereas total body insulin resistance has been documented frequently in advanced age (4, 9, 14, 33), the extent and mechanisms associated with myocardial insulin resistance in aging are unknown. We observed that myocardial insulin resistance was associated with impaired insulin-induced Akt-1 phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation but did not involve increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, as was observed in skeletal muscle in our study and has been reported previously (18, 40). In contrast, we observed decreased insulin-receptor and Akt expression in sarcolemmal membranes in senescent myocardium. Prior studies (36) have demonstrated a reduction in insulin-receptor density in senescent myocardium but have not examined altered Akt expression. Importantly, we observed increased PTEN expression in senescent myocardium but not skeletal muscle. Prior studies have identified PTEN as a putative mediator of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (21, 38) but not in myocardium. We have observed previously increased PTEN activity in the hearts of young dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy (26), suggesting that the mechanism of cellular insulin resistance may vary with the target tissue examined (cardiac vs. skeletal muscle).Altered myocardial insulin-mediated glucose uptake and impaired cellular insulin action were observed in association with increased basal NEFA uptake and myocardial oxygen consumption. These findings were seen in association with increased intramyocardial lipid accumulation and altered mitochondrial structure in the myocardium of senescent dogs. Notably, the increase in NEFA uptake and intramyocardial accumulation in the senescent myocardium occurred in the setting of reduced FAT/CD36 but unaltered levels of PPARα and PGC-1α. The mechanism responsible for increased NEFA uptake under circumstances of reduced FAT/CD36 remains to be determined. Prior studies have demonstrated reduced mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle of lean offspring of type 2 diabetes (10, 22, 29) as well as mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle of elderly subjects with insulin resistance (1, 28) in association with intracellular lipid accumulation. Recent evidence suggests that these findings are associated with reduced transcription factors such as PGC-1α (8, 20) or other cellular signaling pathways implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as AMPK (31, 41). We did not observe differences in AMPK activity or PGC-1α expression in the myocardium between young and old in the present study, suggesting that differences in mitochondrial biogenesis did not account for the observed differences in mitochondrial structure or protein expression.Altered mitochondrial structure and function has been identified frequently as a trigger to cellular aging (3, 13, 15) as well as insulin resistance (10, 22, 28, 29). Reduced UCP expression has been identified as a mediator of these events (15). We observed reduced UCP-3 content in mitochondria of older hearts in association with intramyocardial lipid accumulation. Recent evidence has suggested that these UCPs may be involved not only in mitigating the intramitochondrial accumulation of oxygen free radicals (15) through dissipation of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane but also in reverse transport of excess fatty acyl-CoA anion and peroxide from mitochondria (15, 29). Although UCPs and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in cellular aging (3), ours is the first evidence to implicate altered UCP-3 expression in myocardial insulin resistance in advanced age.Oxidative stress has been shown to lead to lipid peroxidation of mitochondrial membrane phospholipids, resulting in vacuolization of the mitochondria similar to that seen in our study (3). Although we cannot establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, the altered mitochondrial structure by electron microscopy decreased UCP-3, MCO1, and SDHA expression, coupled with the accumulation of intramyocardial fat, recapitulate a pathophysiological framework that has been established for insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (10, 22, 29) but extends the mechanism to the pathogenesis of myocardial insulin resistance. Together, these data suggest that normal aging is associated with both whole body and myocardial insulin resistance in the absence of significant obesity, physical inactivity, or contractile dysfunction. Notably, the cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance vary between skeletal muscle and myocardium as reflected in the distinct roles played by the increased expression of phospho-IRS-1 Ser307 and PTEN, respectively. In addition, there appear to be differences in the respective tissues in the nature and extent of mitochondrial structural changes with aging. Both mechanisms appear to be linked to increased intracellular lipid accumulation (25, 26).Despite the magnitude of whole body and myocardial insulin resistance and the nature and extent of mitochondrial structural alterations observed in these old dogs, the consequences to myocardial structure and function are modest at this stage. We observed modest but significant increases in resting heart rates and blood pressures and modest increases in LV mass, but not LV/body weight ratios, seen in association with increased plasma norepinephrine and cardiac norepinephrine spillover. There is an extensive literature linking chronic hyperinsulinemia associated with whole body insulin resistance to increased sympathetic nervous system activation (5, 7, 30), leading to hypertension. In this regard, there was significant impairment in isovolumic relaxation time, LV stroke work, and external mechanical efficiency. The impairment in cardiac external mechanical efficiency is interesting in light of excessive myocardial fatty acid uptake in older dogs under basal fasting conditions. The suppression of myocardial NEFA uptake and the associated reduction in Mvo2 observed during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in older dogs resulted in a significant improvement in external mechanical efficiency. The extent to which these age-related myocardial metabolic abnormalities predispose to altered systemic hemodynamics and LV function or predispose to increased consequences from superimposed cardiac injury remains to be determined.This is the first study to demonstrate the magnitude and the cellular basis of insulin resistance in myocardium from a relevant large-animal model of cardiovascular aging (10, 11, 12, 35). There are relatively few studies that have examined these metabolic derangements in senescent beagles or have looked at associated hemodynamic alterations with aging in this species. Prior studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated alterations in insulin-receptor autophosphorylation in obese rhesus macaques and impaired insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic aged rhesus macaques. Notably, we chose to control for the effects of obesity and activity level in our study to focus on the effects of aging per se. Similarly, we chose to study a model that does not develop coronary atherosclerosis in order not to confound the effects of aging per se. Nonetheless, there are several questions that remain to be elucidated. We did not measure lactate uptake during the hyperinsulinemic clamps, nor did we measure glucose or NEFA oxidation. We did not examine the effects of superimposed stress on the age-related responses. Such important inquiry will remain a subject for future investigations.GRANTSThis work has been supported in part by United States Public Health Service Grants AG-023125 and DA-104080.FOOTNOTESWe thank Teresa Hentosz for her assistance in the preparation of the manuscript.REFERENCES1 Barazzoni R.

Blame-game weary House panel vows action on insulin prices,"Lawmakers told the three drugmakers that sell insulin in the U.S. and the middlemen companies that negotiate what insurers pay for those medicines that if they did not find a way to lower prices, Capitol Hill would do it for them. Executives from the insulin companies, Eli Lilly and Co., Novo Nordisk A/S and Sanofi, and the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s OptumRx and Cigna Corp.'s Express Scripts, all agreed the U.S. drug pricing system was broken. But members of the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee made it clear they were tired of hearing that excuse and wanted real solutions to soaring insulin prices, which have left some patients having to ration their medicine, often resulting in their illness worsening, with some even dying. ""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., told the drugmakers and PBM middlemen. The hearing was the second time this month the subcommittee had discussed the high costs of insulin. It had convened an earlier session on the matter on April 2, where the lawmakers heard from a panel of diabetes experts, advocates and patients. ""We have the names of people who have died because they couldn't get their insulin,"" Schakowsky said at the April 10 hearing. The Illinois lawmaker warned the companies they were ""in trouble"" and members of Congress — on both sides of the aisle — were committed to taking action. The House and the Senate both have ongoing bipartisan investigations into insulin prices and both chambers have convened hearings on the matter. The Senate Finance Committee had met just a day earlier to examine the overall problem of high U.S. drug prices, where the senators grilled executives from CVS, Cigna and OptumRx and two other PBMs. The Finance Committee had convened a hearing in February with executives from seven drug companies, though Sanofi was the only insulin maker to appear before that panel. 'Your days are numbered' The April 10 House hearing was the first time lawmakers had summoned insulin makers and PBMs to testify jointly on Capitol Hill. ""If you think you can just out talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" Schakowsky said. Hours before the hearing, Sanofi revealed it planned to offer its insulin products for $99 per month for up to 10 boxes, though not including its combination medicine. Weeks earlier, Lilly also said it would offer a generic version of its Humalog insulin at half the price the brand is listed. Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., however, rebuked the companies, noting those efforts had come after years of public outcry and only shortly before the drugmakers were to appear before Congress. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, suggested that if drugmakers and PBMs could not soon bring prices down significantly, the government should take over the situation and set the prices of prescription medicines. He noted that throughout the hearing, the biopharmaceutical companies had pointed the finger at the PBMs and the middlemen pointed right back at the drugmakers — going in circles blaming one another, much the same way the battle over prices has continued outside the walls of Congress. ""You keep saying the system, the system, the system doesn't work. Why doesn't this competitive market-based system work anymore? What has happened?"" Pallone asked. He pressed drugmakers on why they were blaming PBMs when the manufacturers in fact set and control the list prices of their medicines and have the power to bring them down. The drug companies, however, insisted that their list prices are driven by the rebates and discounts demanded by the PBMS, which determine placement on formularies — insurance companies' lists of covered medicines. Another Democrat, Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland, said that while the U.S. drug pricing system may have needed an intermediary in the beginning, ""now things have gotten out of control."" He suggested PBMs should be converted to a system like utilities or nonprofits, with the government having some control in their activities. Change is not optional Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., the only licensed pharmacist in Congress, said he remembered the days when he could order drugs for his community pharmacy directly from biopharmaceutical companies, without having to go through the middlemen. ""I have seen patients at the counter having to make a decision between buying medicine and between buying groceries,"" Carter said. ""I was the boots on the ground there and that's why I'm so passionate about it."" Carter said drugmakers and PBMs have accomplished something lawmakers have been unable to do his entire time in Congress: create bipartisanship. ""This is going to end,"" he said. ""I've seen what you've done."" Oversight Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said Congress was committed to taking action to change the ""smoke and mirror system"" of the way drugmakers and PBMs do business together, particularly with insulin prices. She said the subcommittee would work on solutions in a bipartisan manner with input from the companies and then bring the drugmakers and the PBMs back in July or September to talk about any progress they have made on fixing the situation. ""This is not optional and this is going to happen,"" DeGette vowed.",https://t.co/mq88Xu2BKm,others
CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway activates brown adipocytes and induces insulin resistance in CXCR4-deficient mice under high-fat diet,"Ethics statementAll experimental procedures were performed in accordance with specified guidelines and regulations for the care and use of laboratory animals. All animal procedures were approved by the Chiba University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Establishment of immortalised brown adipocytesThe BAT derived from C57BL/6 mice was finely chopped in balanced salt solution of Hanks with collagenase (C2139; Sigma) and bovine serum albumin (A9647; Sigma). Tissue samples were incubated with hot water at 37 °C for 30 min under constant shaking. The cell suspension was filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)- high glucose (D5796; Sigma) and immortalised by infection with SV40 lentivirus (Applied Biological Materials Inc.). Introduction of SV40 lentivirus into cells was confirmed from the expression of SV40 lentiviral gene with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. These cells were called as CB-1 cells.Differentiation of brown adipocytesConfluent CB-1 cells were exposed to a differentiation medium. Differentiation medium is DMEM-high glucose containing 20 nM insulin (I6634; Sigma) and 1 nM T3 (T2877; Sigma). On the second day, the medium was changed to induction media, which comprised the differentiation medium plus 0.125 mM indomethacin (I7378; Sigma), 2 μg/mL of dexamethasone (D4902; Sigma), and 0.25 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (I7018; Sigma). On the third day, the medium was changed to differentiation medium. The differentiation medium was exchanged every 2 to 3 days after the fourth day. The state of CB-1 cells was observed, and the experiment was conducted in CB-1 cells with many lipid droplets in the cytoplasm after about 15 days from differentiation induction.Activation of brown adipocytes by CXCL12Mature CB-1 cells were treated with 20 or 100 nM of recombinant CXCL12 (Murine SDF-1α: CXCL12 #250-20A; PEPROTECH) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. About 1 mM of CL316,243 (C5976; Sigma) as a selective β3AD-R agonist was added to mature CB-1 cells for the positive control of brown adipocyte activation.Evaluation of mRNA expression levelWe extracted mRNA using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). After treatment, CB-1 cells were washed thrice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by RLT buffer. The cell lysate was collected from the bottom of the culture dish using a scraper and transferred into the column of RNeasy kit. RNA was eluted using 20 μL of RNase-free water. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from the eluted RNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). Expression of mRNA in the cells was examined by qRT-PCR (ABI7900; Applied Biosystems) with the cyber green method of the primer set (Supplementary Table S1). Level of mRNA were normalised to 36B4 gene.Detection of protein expression by western blottingProteins were extracted using the radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing Complete (04693116001; Roche) as a protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell lysate was transferred into microtubes and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. After collection of the supernatant, protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce® BSA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were mixed with 6 μL of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer and the volume was adjusted to 20 μL using RIPA buffer. The samples were heated at 98 °C for 4 min and applied into the wells of 10% polyacrylamide gel® (ATTO) with electrophoresis apparatus. About 5 μL of Precision Plus Protein Standards (#161-0374; BIO-RAD) as protein markers were applied to a specific well of the polyacrylamide gel. The samples in the well were run at 0.04 A for 80 min. The separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Sequi-Blot PVDF Membrane; BIO-RAD) at 20 V for 90 min. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% of Tween-20 (TBS-T) in 5% skim milk. After washing thrice with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaker with anti-UCP-1 antibody (ab10983; Abcam) as the primary antibody. The membrane was washed with TBS-T and treated with an anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked Whole Antibody (NA934; GE Healthcare) in TBS-T as the secondary antibody for 1 h on a shaker at room temperature. Anti-β-actin antibody (A1978; SIGMA-ALDRICH) was used as an internal control. After washing thrice with TBS-T, the membrane was treated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) mix (RPN2209; Amersham) for 5 min. The protein bands were exposed to an X-ray film in the dark and quantified using densitometry with ImageJ software (National Institute of Health).Measurement of oxygen consumptionDifferentiated CB-1 cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in a non-CO2 incubator. OCR and ECAR in each well were evaluated with XF 96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience Inc.). Twelve measurements were approximately taken after every 7 min. CXCL12 and CL316,243 were added to each well via an injection device after the third measurement. The final concentrations of CXCL12 and CL316,243 were adjusted to 100 μM and 1 mM, respectively, in each well.Signal pathway experimentDifferentiated CB-1 cells were preincubated with P38, ERK, and PKA signal inhibitor at 37 °C for 30 min and treated with 100 nM of CXCL12 for 2 h. SB203580 (#5633; Cell Signalling Technology) as a P38 inhibitor, FR180204 (#0320; Sigma-Aldrich) as an ERK inhibitor, and H89 (#9844; Cell Signalling Technology) as a PKA inhibitor were adjusted to a final concentration of 10, 25, and 10 μM, respectively. At the end of the reaction, cell lysate was harvested using RLT buffer and RNeasy Mini kit. Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and examined with qRT-PCR to detect UCP-1 mRNA expression.Phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated ERKCXCL 12 was added to CB-1 cells, and proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer after 15 minutes and 30 minutes. After western blotting, total p38(9212 S; Cell Signaling), phosphorylated p38(9211 S; Cell Signaling), total ERK (9102 S; Cell Signaling), and phosphorylated ERK (9106 S; Cell Signaling) were reacted as primary antibodies. After reacting with ECL using HRP secondary antibody, it was exposed to x-ray film, and the band was finally quantified.Mice with cold circumstances or HFD feedingC57/B6 mice were placed at 4 °C as a cold environment for 4 h, and their BATs were excised after stimulation. C57/B6 mice as the control mice were left at 28 °C (room temperature) for 4 h. The expression of mRNA in the BAT was evaluated using qRT-PCR. An obesity model mouse induced with HFD was prepared. Four-week-old C57/B6 mice were fed with 60 kcal% of fat as a part of HFD (D12492; RESEARCH DIET INC.) for 4 weeks. Mice fed with 5 kcal% of fat as a normal fat diet (ND) (CE-2; CREA Japan Inc.) were regarded as a control group.Extraction of mRNA from tissuesThe BAT was homogenised with 1 mL of TRIZOL reagent (15596018; Invitrogen) for ~30 mg of BAT. After homogenisation, the insoluble fraction was removed with centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant sample was treated with 0.2 mL of chloroform at room temperature for 5 min. The tube was vortexed for 15 s and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 0.5 mL of isopropyl alcohol. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellet was washed once with 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 75,00 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was dried and 30 μL of RNase-free water was added to the pellet. The pellet was mixed by pipetting and incubated at 60 °C for 10 min. cDNA was prepared using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (205311; QIAGEN) from the obtained RNA, and mRNA expression was examined with qRT-PCR.Generation of knockout miceCXCR4flox mice were purchased from RIKEN BioResource Center (Ibaraki, Japan). UCP-1 Cre mice were provided by Charles River Labs Japan Inc. CXCR4flox/flox mice were crossed with UCP-1 Cre mice to obtain F 2 generation of brown fat-specific CXCR4-deficient mice. Primary brown adipocytes derived from the BAT of these mice were cultured and the expression of mRNA was confirmed with qRT-PCR. BAT, WAT, and liver were excised from these mice, and the gene expression level was tested in each tissue. CXCR4flox/− mice sibling was regarded as control mice.Exposure to HFD or normal chow dietHFD containing 60 kcal% of fat was administered to male knockout mice and control mice until 32 weeks. Body weight and occasional blood glucose level were weekly measured. Food intake were estimated every five weeks.Evaluation of glucose metabolismIntra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was carried out after 5 weeks of HFD or normal chow diet feeding. Mice were fasted for 15 h, and the glucose amount for injection was set at 2 g/kg. ITT was carried out to evaluate insulin sensitivity at 7 weeks after HFD or normal chow diet feeding. Mice were fed ad libidum and the amount of insulin was set at 0.6 units/kg. IPGTT was administered by the same protocol at 26 weeks after HFD or normal chow diet feeding. Insulin amount was set to 1.0 units/kg in ITT at 26 weeks. Blood was collected from the vein of the tail at fasting and 30 min after glucose loading. Serum insulin level was measured with Morinaga Ultra Sensitive Mouse/Rat Insulin ELISA Kit (M1104; Morinaga).Evaluation of CXCL12, and CXCR4 protein level in BATProteins were extracted using RIPA buffer in the liver of wild type and the knockout mice. After western blotting, anti-CXCL12 (ab18919; abcam) antibody and anti-CXCR4 (ab124824; abcam) antibody were reacted as primary antibodies. After reacting with ECL using HRP secondary antibody, it was exposed to x-ray film, and the band was finally quantified.Measurement of serum CXCL12 concentrationThe concentration of serum CXCL12 was measured at 5 and 26 weeks after feeding with HFD using R&amp;D Systems Quantikine ELISA Mouse CXCL12/SDF-1α (#MCX120; R&amp;D Systems).Single injection of CXCL12 in BAT of wild type miceWild type mice were injected phosphate buffered saline, CXCL12, or CL316, 243 as control, CXCL12, or positive control, respectively. Injection dose of CXCL12, and CL316,243 were 10 μg and 0.1μg base on 1 g body weight, respectively. Each BAT was excised 4 hours after injection and RNA was extracted. UCP-1 mRNA levels as an activation marker for BAT were quantified by qRT-PCR.Quantification of Phosphorylated Akt in the Liver of Mice with High Fat DietProteins were extracted from the liver by RIPA buffer. After electrophoresis of proteins, western blot is performed, and phosphorylated Akt antibody (2965 S; Cell Signaling) and total Akt (4691 S; Cell Signaling) antibody are reacted as a primary antibody, and ECL is added after reaction with a secondary antibody with HRP. It was taken in as an image after exposure to X-ray film.RNA-seq in BAT of the wild type and the knockout mice with the high-fat chowA series of RNA-seq libraries was prepared in Kazusa DNA Research Institute.We compared wild type and knockout mice with the R (Bio Conductor software package; version 3.4.1) and listed about 120 genes with P &lt; 0.01. The biological process, KEGG pathway was obtained by analysing these genes into the String-database (https://string-db.org/). Furthermore, I made a figure of 12 genes included in the Positive regulation of lipid metabolism, which comes to the top by Biological process.",https://t.co/OY8UxSN5iA,others

In Experiment 1, cumulus-oocyte complexes were matured in the absence or presence of IGF-I (100 ng.mL(-1)) and then vitrified-warmed with or without 2mM of GSH. Maturation rate was evaluated before vitrification, and oocyte viability, DNA fragmentation and relative transcript abundances of BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX), BCL2-like1 (BCL2L1), heat shock protein 70 (HSPA1A), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) genes were assessed in fresh and vitrified-warmed oocytes. In Experiment 2, fresh and vitrified-warmed oocytes were in vitro fertilized and their developmental competence determined. Whereas the addition of IGF-I to maturation medium had no effect on oocyte maturation, it caused an increase in the survival rate of vitrified-warmed oocytes. This effect was accompanied by a concomitant augment in the relative transcript abundance of HSPA1A and a decrease of BAX. Furthermore, the addition of GSH to vitrification-warming media increased survival rates at post-warming. Likewise, the action of GSH was concomitant with an increase in the relative abundance of GPX1 and a decrease of BAX transcript. Blastocyst rates of vitrified-warmed oocytes did not differ from their fresh counterparts when IGF-I and GSH were combined. In conclusion, supplementing maturation medium with 100 ng.mL(-1) IGF-I and vitrification-warming solutions with 2 mM GSH improves the quality and cryotolerance of IVM pig oocytes, through a mechanism that involves BAX, GPX1 and HSPA1A expression.(PDF emailed within 0-6 h: $19.90)Accession: 066383436Download citation: RIS BibTeX TextPMID: 30692931DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.01894In-vitro development of vitrified-warmed bovine oocytes after activation may be predicted based on mathematical modelling of cooling and warming rates during vitrification, storage and sample removal.

Methylglyoxal and insulin resistance in berberine-treated type 2 diabetic patients,"Methylglyoxal and insulin resistance in berberine-treated type 2 diabetic patientsMethylglyoxal and insulin resistance in berberine-treated type 2 diabetic patientsMemon, M.Ayoob.; Khan, R.Noor.; Riaz, S.; Ain, Q.Ul.; Ahmed, M.; Kumar, N.Journal of Research in Medical Sciences 23: 110-1102019Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder of hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia produces advanced glycation end products such as the methylglyoxal (MGO) which interferes with cell functions, insulin signaling, and β-cell functions. The present study was conducted to determine the effects of berberine (BBR) therapy on serum MGO and insulin resistance in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. The present case-control study was conducted at the Department of Medicine, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Jamshoro/Hyderabad, from March 2016 to January 2017. A sample of 200 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients was divided into two groups. Group 1 received metformin 500 mg (×3 daily) and Group 2 received BBR 500 mg (×3 daily) for 3 months. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 3 months to analyze biochemical parameters on Roche biochemical analyzer. MGO was assayed by ELISA kit and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) model. SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Incorporation, USA) analyzed the data at 95% confidence interval (P ≤ 0.05). Baseline HOMA-IR (% IR) and MGO were found elevated in metformin and BBR groups. After 3 months of metformin and BBR therapy, the HOMA-IR (% IR) and MGO were decreased to 3.69 ± 1.13 and 2.64 ± 0.76 and 35.84 ± 12.56 and 26.64 ± 10.73 ng/dl, respectively (P = 0.0001). HOMA-IR (% IR) was improved by 40% and 73% (P = 0.0001) and MGO by 43% and 56% in metformin and BBR groups, respectively (P = 0.0001). BBR is more effective in decreasing the serum MGO levels and insulin resistance through improved glycemic control in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients.(PDF emailed within 0-6 h: $19.90)Accession: 066133104Download citation: RIS BibTeX TextPMID: 30693045DOI: 10.4103/jrms.JRMS_1078_17Both resistance- and endurance-type exercise reduce the prevalence of hyperglycaemia in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and in insulin-treated and non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients.

The efficacy and safety of velagliflozin over 16 weeks as a treatment for insulin dysregulation in ponies,"The study investigated the efficacy and safety of velagliflozin over 16 wk. of treatment, and a four wk. withdrawal period in 12 insulin-dysregulated ponies. No adverse effects were identified, and the therapy was well accepted, as well as efficacious in reducing the hyperinsulinemic response to oral NSC.The application of sodium-glucose linked transport inhibitors within the veterinary field is new. It is encouraging that no clinical signs of adverse effects were seen during daily monitoring by the researchers, or during regular physical examinations conducted by experienced veterinarians. The absence of any remarkable changes in blood biochemistry and haematology, attests further to the safety of this compound.In terms of SGLT-2 safety, their mode of action in promoting glucosuria raises a concern about the inherent risk of hypoglycaemia. Importantly, no hypoglycaemia was evident during the present study, either clinically, or during the measurement of basal blood glucose after a 13 h overnight fast. This is consistent with our previous results [20], and with the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in humans, where the risk of hypoglycaemia is considered low, as the renal threshold for glucose excretion is not lowered to the point of the hypoglycemic threshold [26]. Additionally, in humans, hepatic gluconeogenesis protects against hypoglycaemia, and it was recently concluded in a velagliflozin study in felines that endogenous glucose production likely balanced the action of velagliflozin to maintain euglycemia [26, 27].A transient decrease in Cmax blood glucose occurred in the control group at wk-8 and wk-16, but not in the velagliflozin-treated group. No confounding factors could be identified to explain this difference, although numerically the control group had slightly higher glucose concentrations in wk-0 than the treated animals (Fig. 1). It is possible that endogenous glucose production in velagliflozin-treated animals prevented a reduction in Cmax glucose, and this could explain the lack of association between insulin and glucose changes in this group (Fig. 1). This mechanism should be investigated further, including the quantification of glucagon concentrations in velagliflozin-treated equids.In terms of efficacy, the reduction in hyper-responsiveness to oral carbohydrates was convincing. In particular, our previous study identified a clear relationship between the speed of onset and the frequency of laminitis in ponies that were fed the same diet challenge as used in the present study, for up 18 d. A risk threshold for laminitis was identified, when the insulin Cmax exceeded 195 μIU/mL in response to the diet challenge meal (Fig. 1) [4]. Importantly, velagliflozin reduced the insulin response to well below this threshold in all treated ponies after 16 wk. of treatment (Table 2). Although post-prandial insulin concentrations were not normalized, these findings are strongly encouraging. Additionally, the diet challenge meal provided considerably more NSC (3.8 g NSC/kg BW) than the oral sugar test (OST) that is recommended by the Equine Endocrinology group for the diagnosis of insulin dysregulation [15]. The diet challenge was used to assess insulin dysregulation in this study as access to corn syrup in Australia is very limited. Additionally, the diet challenge has been shown to provide clear demarcation between ponies who did and did not develop laminitis when fed the diet for up to 18 d, which was useful when considering velagliflozin as a potential laminitis preventive agent [4]. Nevertheless, the diet challenge is not recommended for routine clinical use due to a greater risk that laminitis may be incited by this test.The present study has also established that the effects of velagliflozin are not long-lasting, as the insulin concentrations returned to within 3% of the pre-trial measurements after a 4-wk withdrawal. The absence of any rebound increase in the insulin response to the diet challenge is a promising finding, although we can-not rule out the possibility of a short-term rebound effect within the 4-wk period between diet challenge tests.It is noteworthy that velagliflozin did not affect insulin resistance per se in this study, with no change in CGIT measurements of glucose or insulin concentrations over time, or in the number of ponies classified as IR according to the test. Previously, we have speculated that IR in horses is driven by chronic hyperinsulinemia, which results from excessive glucose absorption from the gut [8]. However, in the present study, the hyperinsulinemic response to oral NSC was reduced in the treated ponies, but IR remained unchanged. Thus, the present results suggest that more research is needed to better understand the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and IR, with the possibility that different modes of treatment may be necessary to suit different forms of insulin dysregulation. Additionally, we acknowledge that the interpretation of the CGIT results presented in this paper is complicated by the use of a chemiluminescent insulin assay, whereas radioimmunoassays have been used in the reference studies cited [21, 28]. It has been shown when comparing these types of assays that results are not consistent [29, 30]. Additionally, glucose values were not used to generate a binary classification of IR (positive or negative), due to recently published data concerning poor specificity as a diagnostic test [21]. Hence, the CGIT data presented here should be interpreted with caution.A factor important to the interpretation of the present results, is that the ponies were maintained on a high NSC diet throughout the study, in order keep the animals in a 'fat' body condition. This diet provided considerably more energy and NSC than is currently recommended for feeding insulin-dysregulated horses [31–33], and indeed, laminitis was incited in one control. This diet may have also mitigated any effect of velagliflozin on BW, which was unchanged for the study duration. The results in this study contrast with those from some human and rodent experiments, where SGLT-2 inhibitors have caused a modest weight loss [34–36]. Despite the limitations of this diet, it did provide a useful insight into the likely effects of velagliflozin as a treatment for inactive (stabled), over-fed, insulin-dysregulated ponies, and the fact that the compound was efficacious in this situation is promising for future clinical trials.Leptin concentrations were moderate to high in both groups of ponies according to the current test interpretations, although as a technical caveat, comparisons to other published data may be difficult as the antibodies of the test were changed in 2016 [37]. The data seem to be consistent with the fat body condition of the ponies in the present study, and as leptin has been shown to be proportional to fat mass and BW it may be unsurprising that leptin concentrations were unchanged throughout this study, as BW did not change [38, 39]. However, other studies in horses have shown that feed restriction was associated with a decrease in leptin concentrations [40], and conversely, our ponies were fed 1/3 of the diet challenge meal in the two days prior to diet challenge testing to allow taste adjustment, hence this extra meal may have affected leptin concentrations. Studies in other species have shown that SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease leptin concentrations [41, 42], and the decrease may be independent of significant weight loss [43]. In another study performed by the authors, leptin concentrations decreased after 16 wk. of velagliflozin treatment irrespective of bodyweight (unpublished data). Variability between ponies in terms of breed, height and weight, and also the relatively small sample size of the two groups in this study could additionally explain the lack of difference seen in the present study. Within human literature, there is growing evidence that leptin is not merely a marker of obesity, but an important pro-inflammatory adipokine involved in the pathophysiology of metabolically induced cardiovascular and renal disease [44]. Hence, the effect of velagliflozin on the relationship between bodyweight, biologically active fat deposits and leptin concentrations should be investigated further.Besides the relatively small sample size of the two groups, further limitations of the study include the use of a CGIT to assess insulin sensitivity, which might have been better evaluated using a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, or a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test [45]. Furthermore, if it had been logistically possible, it would have been useful to conduct urinalysis, and also to quantify the water intake and urinary output in this study.Lastly, as the ponies were stabled and fed a set high NSC diet, the relevance of these results to animals at pasture could be questioned. Conversely, it could be argued that NSC intake is most difficult to limit in a grazing situation, and coupled with a genetic predisposition towards insulin dysregulation, this is the fundamental reason why so many animals develop laminitis. As endocrinopathic laminitis is the most common form of the disease [46], future studies should examine velagliflozin under grazing conditions.",https://t.co/fpHJyRO4Ur,others
Teaching Patients How to Use Inhaled Insulin,"Anne L. Peters, MD: Ever since I completed a research study using inhaled insulin, I found myself using it a lot more frequently. I realized that in doing this study, not only did I get used to it and how it worked in my patients, but I also developed a way to teach patients how to use it. I basically reduced the barriers to my using it, and now I use it often; therefore, I'm quite comfortable with it. I wanted to share that experience with you and also have you learn from Mark Harmel, my diabetes educator, who is so good at teaching patients how to use it that it works quite effectively. Inhaled insulin works as follows. You have a patient pick a dose; it comes in a cartridge of 4, 8, or 12 units. The patient takes the dose just before eating. The insulin works very fast and it also goes away pretty quickly. It helps the patient really catch that first postprandial rise. If the patient's glucose level is high after eating, they can take another puff to bring down that blood glucose level. It doesn't cause the stacking phenomenon that you get with injected insulin. When to Take It Inhaled insulin is really good at the start of a meal. It's also a great correction insulin. My patients will use it after a meal—1 to 2 hours later if they have high levels—or when they're running high. For example, if a patient is on a sensor and he sees that his levels have been high all afternoon, he can take a puff of the inhaled insulin and his glucose level will come back down without going too low. Inhaled insulin is an incredibly useful tool for my patients with diabetes. I use it in both type 1 individuals and people with type 2 diabetes who are on insulin. The way I start patients is by having them pick one meal—usually dinner. I'm not a big believer in having a patient switch entirely to a different way [of taking insulin]. Obviously, patients stay on their basal insulin and I usually have them get used to taking it before dinner. How Much to Take Many patients may be nervous at first and they often don't take enough. They say, ""Oh, I only need 4 units."" Well, that's not true in most cases; they'll need 8 or 12 units. I let them work up and then see the effects. It's easy for patients who are on a continuous glucose monitor to see the effect of the inhaled insulin and see if their blood sugar is subsequently high. Those who are self-monitoring blood glucose with finger sticks can test an hour or two after a meal to see if they need a correction. I'll start patients with taking it with one meal a day and then advance to more meals per day as they fit this into their routine. I see it as an exceedingly useful tool to add to what my patients already have for managing their diabetes. Some patients will use it often (for every meal), some patients use it for correction, and some patients use it for both. The key to getting a patient to use inhaled insulin comfortably is in the teaching. I'm going to have Mark give you a lesson on how to teach your patients the correct way to use inhaled insulin. Teaching Your Patients Mark Harmel, MPH: Thank you, Anne. When I get study participants or patients in the clinic, the first thing I do is a lung test. We have to check and see if their lungs are healthy enough to use inhaled insulin. We use this device that measures lung capacity to do the FEV1 test. There is a little cardboard tube that goes onto this device. The patient takes a deep breath and blows it out very quickly, and then we measure the reading on the front of the device. We put that into a CDC website calculator, and if their lung capacity is at 75% or more, they qualify to use inhaled insulin. Next, you have to teach the patient how to inhale. There is this inhaler that's about the size of a whistle. You pop it open, and there are individual cartridges that you insert into the inhaler. You can see that there's a little point on the tip of one of them, and the tub that holds the powdered insulin is at the bottom. The tub goes down, you fit the point on the cartridge to the point on the inside of the inhaler, and then you snap it closed. Once you close the inhaler, it's important to keep it level because the insulin will fall out if you tip it over. Take off the mouth guard, take a little sip of water, inhale smoothly and gently, hold it in your lungs for a few seconds, and then exhale. There's a video on the Afrezza website that worked wonders for some of my patients. We also have to teach patients how to take care of the insulin. Inside the package, there are two folded pieces of paper. One of them has the typical drug warnings that are in many of your medications. Another paper has some nice illustrated instructions. There is also the refrigeration page. Just like your liquid insulin, you have to keep it refrigerated. It could take a couple of days or a week before patients really get the hang of using inhaled insulin. Be conservative to start, and make sure that patients have their fast-acting glucose with them in case they use too much. They'll learn how to use it over time. Many people find that they really like inhaled insulin as an option. Some people shift to it completely for mealtime use and others only use it occasionally. Your patients will find what's right for them. Peters: Thank you very much for that, Mark. If you feel comfortable with this, take the time to teach your patients, and have them watch the appropriate videos. You can teach your patients to quickly become experts in using inhaled insulin. Hopefully, it can help improve their outcomes.",https://t.co/83bTLDQiy0,others

Human duct cells contribute to β cell compensation in insulin resistance,"Glucose homeostasis and metabolic parameters in pregnant LIRKO mice. During late pregnancy, mothers develop relative insulin resistance to accommodate an appropriate supply of nutrients to the fetus (12). To assess whether superimposing pregnancy in insulin-resistant LIRKO (35) mice is able to activate generation of new β cells from additional reserves, we phenotyped the animals before, during, and after pregnancy. Although both control and LIRKO mice gained significant weight during the progression of pregnancy/gestation (G), no significant differences were observed between groups before or during pregnancy or in the postpartum (P) periods (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.99576DS1). As expected, serum insulin levels in control mice increased during pregnancy, resulting in reduced blood glucose levels (Figure 1, A and B). The higher circulating insulin levels in nonpregnant (G0) LIRKO mice further increased and remained consistently higher during pregnancy, with elevated blood glucose levels peaking on day G15.5 and returning to normal levels on P4 (Figure 1, A and B).Figure 1Compensatory islet hyperplasia in pregnant LIRKO mice. (A) Serum insulin (n = 3–9 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test) and (B) blood glucose levels (n = 3–7 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test) in female control and LIRKO mice measured before gestation (G0), during (G15.5, G17.5) pregnancy, and after (P4 and P10) pregnancy. (C) Blood glucose values following an oral glucose tolerance test (2.5 g/kg BW) (n = 4–7 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test) and (D) glucose levels plotted as percentage of basal values, following i.p. injection of insulin (1 U/kg BW) (n = 3–6 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test).

In addition, the impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant LIRKO mice worsened around midpregnancy (G15.5) (Figure 1C and Supplemental Figure 1C). The LIRKO mice also exhibited a relatively severer insulin resistance compared with controls in both nonpregnant and pregnant states (Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure 1D), consistent with our previous report (36), supporting the notion that the pregnant LIRKO mouse is a suitable model to investigate pathways that contribute to expanding the β cell pool during extreme demands.LIRKO mice exhibit ability to further enhance proliferation ofβcells during pregnancy. To evaluate the effects of superimposing pregnancy in a genetic model that already exhibits compensatory islet hyperplasia, we systematically examined islet architecture, islet cell composition, and β cell proliferation, size, mass, and apoptosis. Analysis of islet morphology in the pancreas sections of control pregnant or nonpregnant mice showed a relatively normal islet cell distribution pattern with a core of β cells and non–β cells forming the mantle (Figure 1E). In contrast, and especially in pregnant LIRKO mice, the core and majority (90%–95%) of the periphery of the hyperplastic islets were almost exclusively composed of β cells, with a lower percentage of α and δ cells accumulated in one-half of the islet (Figure 1E).Analyses of cells within each islet showed a dramatically increased β cell number in both nonpregnant (G0) and pregnant LIRKO mice (Figure 1F). Furthermore, the islet endocrine cell composition revealed that, although the β cell population was further increased in pregnant mice in both groups, the proportions of glucagon- and somatostatin-producing cells were significantly lower during and following pregnancy only in the LIRKO mice (Figure 1G). The increase in β cells from G0 to G15.5 in control mice was secondary to enhanced proliferation as shown by an increase in Ki67+ β cells followed by a decrease to nonpregnant levels after birth (Figure 1, H and I, and Supplemental Table 1). In contrast, the approximately 2-fold increase in β cell proliferation in LIRKO mice, compared with control animals at G0, went up further, approximately 4-fold, by G15.5 and decreased to control levels postpartum (P0 and P4) (Figure 1, H and I, and Supplemental Table 1). The β cell proliferation was confirmed by immunostaining for the M phase proliferation marker, phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) (Supplemental Figure 2, A and B, and Supplemental Table 1), and was consistent with the total β cells per mm2 of pancreas area (Supplemental Figure 2C). Although α cell proliferation showed a decrease in pregnant control mice, the LIRKO mice exhibited significantly lower α cell proliferation before, during, and after pregnancy (Supplemental Figure 2, D and E) consistent with the islet cell composition in LIRKO mice shown in Figure 1G. Whether this decrease in α cells is because some of them are contributing to the increased β cell pool during pregnancy requires further investigation.Similar to the effects on proliferation, β cell mass and area increased during pregnancy in both groups and decreased postpartum compared with nonpregnant states. In striking contrast, pregnant LIRKO mice showed an additional significant increase in β cell mass and area after G15.5 that peaked at P0 compared with controls at the same time point (Figure 1, J and K, and Supplemental Figure 2F). Furthermore, cell size assessed by coimmunostaining for β-catenin and insulin did not show statistically significant differences between control and LIRKO mice before, during, or after pregnancy (Supplemental Figure 2, G and H). β Cell apoptosis evaluated by TUNEL-labeling did not show differences between control and LIRKO mice at G15.5 (Supplemental Figure 2I). Overall, these results suggest that in addition to replication, LIRKO mice mobilize non–β cells to further enhance β cell numbers during pregnancy, and this prompted us to speculate about other sources of β cells.Alterations in pregnancy hormones and serotonin in LIRKO mice. Pregnancy hormones have been a focus of study as important stimuli to drive β cell proliferation during pregnancy (18). Surprisingly, prolactin and progesterone levels were significantly decreased in LIRKO mice during pregnancy while only estradiol levels were increased at G15.5 in LIRKO compared with control mice (Supplemental Figure 3, A–C). Despite the dramatic difference in pregnancy hormones, the duration of pregnancy and litter sizes were similar between groups (36). Furthermore, the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that has been implicated in pregnancy hormone–induced increase in β cell mass (17), was higher in the LIRKO mice compared with control mice (Supplemental Figure 4, A–G). Although we did not observe differences in expression of serotonin receptors between groups (data not shown), additional work is necessary to explore the role of serotonin, if any, in promoting an increase in β cell mass in the LIRKO model.Increased insulin+ ductal cells and small islet clusters adherent to ducts in pregnant LIRKO mice. To investigate the direct role of ductal cells in the expansion of β cell mass, we first examined the incidence of cells that were double positive for insulin and the duct marker, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA). Control mice showed an increase in insulin and DBA double-positive cells during pregnancy that reduced to nonpregnant levels in the postpartum period (Figure 2, A and B). Although LIRKO dams revealed a similar pattern, the number of insulin+ cells in the duct epithelium was significantly higher during and after the first 4 days postpartum (Figure 2, A and B). Notably, glucagon+ ductal cells were also significantly higher at G17.5 in pregnant LIRKO mice (Supplemental Figure 5A). It is possible that the increase in DBA/glucagon double-positive cells represents a compensation for reduced α cell content during late pregnancy (Figure 1G).Figure 2Insulin+ ductal cells and small islet clusters localized close to ducts are increased in LIRKO mice during pregnancy. (A) Representative immunofluorescence images obtained from control and LIRKO mice before, during, and after pregnancy and stained for insulin (shown in blue), glucagon (shown in red) and ductal marker DBA (shown in green). Insets point to DBA and insulin+ cells. (B) Quantification of DBA and insulin double-positive cells in pregnant and nonpregnant control and LIRKO mice (n = 3–5 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test). (C) Representative immunofluorescence images showing small islet clusters positive for insulin (blue) or glucagon (red) and DBA (green). Insets point to clusters localized to ductal structure. (D) Quantification of the distance of scattered islet clusters (fewer than 10 islet cells) from the ducts. Groups are shown as percentage of total scattered islets that were counted (n = 3 pancreas sections analyzed per group for each time point, 2-tailed Student's t test). Scale bars: 10 μm (A), 20 μm (C). #Control versus control, *control versus LIRKO, and §LIRKO versus LIRKO. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. #P, §P, and *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01.Neogenesis is characterized by an increase in the number of small islet clusters (37). Indeed, we also observed an increase in scattered small islet clusters before, during, and after pregnancy in LIRKO mothers that reached significance at G15.5 (control: 0.2 scattered islets/mm2 vs. LIRKO: 0.6 scattered islets/mm2, P = 0.008) (Supplemental Figure 5B). We also observed islet clusters that appeared to be virtually adherent to ducts in the LIRKO mice, especially at G15.5 (G0: 10.1% control vs. 21.2% LIRKO, P = 0.06; and G15.5: 10.5% control vs. 37.8% LIRKO, P = 0.002 of total small islet clusters, respectively) (Figure 2, C and D). The percentage of small islet clusters that were located less than or equal to 5 μm from ducts was higher in LIRKO mice during the transition from G17.5 to P4 (Figure 2D). These data suggest that neogenesis is a contributor to the compensatory β cell pool.The duct epithelium contributes to islet endocrine cell formation. The lack of a phenotype in animals with KO of insulin receptors in ducts (S. Bonner-Weir, Joslin Diabetes Center, personal communication) encouraged us to use duct-specific, carbonic anhydrase–driven Cre and floxed insulin receptor mice to develop an inducible lineage trace model to directly examine whether duct cells are a source of new β cells. To this end we bred tamoxifen-inducible (TM-inducible) carbonic anhydrase II–CreERTM R26R-eYFP (reporter–enhanced yellow fluorescence protein, eYFP) (38) mice with LIRKO animals (Figure 3A). Offspring, carrying the carbonic anhydrase II–driven (CAII-driven) Cre transgene and homozygous for both eYFP and loxP-targeted insulin receptor, were grouped based on the absence (Lox-YFP) or presence (LIRKO-YFP) of the albumin promoter–driven Cre transgene, respectively. Because animals receiving either continuous or 5-day injections of TM during pregnancy had spontaneous abortions, we limited the injections to 3 days (100 mg/kg) starting at G10.5 followed by harvesting of pancreases on day G15.5. Untreated groups were included as controls, and no YFP+ staining was detectable. As expected, the labeling efficiency was relatively low in the TM-treated group; nevertheless, confocal microscopy of samples from TM-treated pregnant and nonpregnant Lox-YFP and LIRKO-YFP mice demonstrated YFP-marked, insulin+ cells in pancreatic islets that were localized close to ductal epithelium (Figure 3B). Control pregnant mice (G15.5) exhibited increased YFP-marked, insulin+ cells compared with nonpregnant animals (Figure 3C), and this number was further increased in pregnant LIRKO-YFP (by approximately 2.3-fold vs. pregnant Lox-YFP, P = 0.07; and by approximately 5-fold vs. nonpregnant LIRKO-YFP mice, P = 0.03), providing direct genetic evidence of ductal contribution to new β cells. Although we did not find any insulin+, YFP+, or SOX9+ cells in G0 and G15.5 Lox-YFP mice, the data in the lineage-tracing studies were supported by the observation of insulin+, YFP+ and SOX9+ ductal cells in pregnant LIRKO-YFP mice and insulin and SOX9 double-positive ductal cells in nonpregnant LIRKO-YFP animals (Supplemental Figure 6A). Moreover, YFP and pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX1) immunostaining revealed double-positive islet β cells only in LIRKO-YFP mice and were observed to be higher during pregnancy (G15.5) (Supplemental Figure 6B). The specificity to generate only β cells by lineage tracing was confirmed by lack of coexpression of YFP and α cell markers (Supplemental Figure 6C).Figure 3The duct epithelium contributes to islet endocrine cell formation. (A) Experimental strategy showing CAII-CreERTM R26R-eYFP mice crossed to Alb-Cre InsRfl/fl animals to generate Lox-YFP and LIRKO-YFP mice and subsequently rendered pregnant.

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05.Humanβcell proliferation is increased in response to pregnancy in NOD/SCID-γLIRKO mice transplanted with human islets. To examine the translational significance of the dramatic increase in β cell mitosis in pregnant LIRKO mice (G15.5), we crossed LIRKO animals with immunodeficient NOD/SCID-γ (NSG) mice (Figure 4A), to allow for human tissue engraftment (39). Offspring carrying albumin promoter–driven Cre transgene (NSG-LIRKO mice) continued to exhibit an insulin-resistant phenotype that was similar to the original LIRKO phenotype (Supplemental Figure 7, A–F, and ref. 40). Next, female NSG-Lox (control) and NSG-LIRKO mice were rendered pregnant following transplantation of human islets (for donor information, see Supplemental Table 2) under the kidney capsule (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 8A), and the islet grafts bearing kidneys and endogenous pancreases were harvested at G15.5. The detection of human insulin and C-peptide in mouse serum confirmed graft survival and functioning human islets at tissue harvest. The average human insulin values (all approximate) were NSG-Lox: 3 mU/L (G0) and 8 mU/L (G15.5); NSG-LIRKO: 39 mU/L (G0) and 116 mU/L (G15.5). The average human C-peptide values (all approximate) were NSG-Lox: 102 mU/L (G0) and 297 mU/L (G15.5); NSG-LIRKO: 863 mU/L (G0) and 497 mU/L (G15.5). Analysis of BrdU incorporation and Ki67 immunostaining revealed a significant increase in human β cell proliferation in islet grafts obtained from pregnant NSG-Lox mice compared with nonpregnant controls (Figure 4, B–D; Supplemental Figure 8, A and B; and Supplemental Table 3). The level of human β cell proliferation in nonpregnant NSG-LIRKO mice was comparable to pregnant NSG-Lox mice, whereas a significant (P = 0.04) increase was evident in pregnant NSG-LIRKO mice compared with their corresponding controls (pregnant NSG-Lox) (Figure 4, B–D; Supplemental Figure 8, A and B; and Supplemental Table 3). Similar results were observed with the proliferation marker, pHH3 (Supplemental Figure 8C and Supplemental Table 3). Finally, consistent with the data in LIRKO mice (Figure 1H), and human islet transplantation studies (Figure 4, B–D, and Supplemental Figure 8C), endogenous pancreatic islets from G15.5 NSG-LIRKO mice demonstrated a significant increase in β cell proliferation (analyzed by BrdU, Ki67, or pHH3) compared with G15.5 NSG-Lox or G0 NSG-LIRKO mice (Supplemental Figure 9, A–C, and Supplemental Table 3). These results clearly point to stimulatory effects in response to increased insulin demand in both human and mouse islets.Figure 4β Cell proliferation is increased in response to pregnancy in human islets transplanted into NSG-LIRKO mice. (A) Experimental strategy showing NSG mice crossed with LIRKO mice to generate NSG-Lox and NSG-LIRKO female mice, followed by transplantation of human islets (1,000 islet equivalents [IEQ]) under the kidney capsule.

To further examine the translational relevance of our findings, we undertook an alternative transplantation approach and transplanted human pancreatic ductal ""aggregates"" together with human islets from the same donor (Figure 4A; for donor information, see Supplemental Table 2) in a ratio that mimics the pancreatic microenvironment. One striking observation in the duct cells was a significant increase in number of proliferating cells that was already evident in the nonpregnant (G0) NSG-LIRKO mice and increased even further at G15.5 (Figure 5, A and B). Further work is necessary to examine the consequences of this increased ductal proliferation.Figure 5Enhanced proliferation and presence of markers of endocrine progenitors and mature β cell markers in duct cells in response to pregnancy in NSG-LIRKO mice cotransplanted with human ducts and human islets.

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, and ***P &lt; 0.001.To explore whether the compensatory increase in proliferating duct cells is a prelude to inducing differentiation toward the β cell lineage, we immunostained the sections for key transcription factors known to be expressed during development of the endocrine pancreas (Figure 5C). Coimmunostaining for human duct–specific cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and transcription factor sex-determining region Y box 9 (SOX9) showed distinct nuclear staining for SOX9 in the NSG-Lox group while several duct cells were SOX9– the NSG-LIRKO group, implying some duct cells were differentiating toward the endocrine lineage (Figure 5D). This was supported by the presence of the endocrine progenitor marker neuronal differentiation (NeuroD1) in duct cells in pregnant NSG-LIRKO mice only (Figure 5E). Although human duct grafts in both NSG-Lox and NSG-LIRKO mice were virtually negative for paired box 6 (PAX6) staining, NSG-LIRKO (G0) mice demonstrated PAX6+ human duct cells that were more frequently detected in pregnant NSG-LIRKO mice (Figure 5F). The mature β cell markers PDX1 and V-Maf Musculoaponeurotic Fibrosarcoma Oncogene Homolog A (MAFA) were observed more frequently in the pregnant NSG-LIRKO group (Figure 5, G and H). Finally, the percentage of insulin and CK19 double-positive cells was significantly higher in pregnant NSG-LIRKO mice compared with nonpregnant NSG-LIRKO mice and pregnant NSG-Lox animals (Figure 5, I and J). These results, from the first study to our knowledge where human ductal cells and islets were cotransplanted into mice and tracked for duct to endocrine cell change during pregnancy, indicate that increased insulin demand drives human ductal cells toward a β or β-like cell identity.Insulin+ duct cells and small islet clusters are increased in human pregnancy and patients with T2D. To obtain further translational evidence for a ductal source of β cells, we screened pancreas sections from human control and pregnant (physiological insulin resistance) samples as well as female patients with T2D (pathological insulin resistance) obtained from the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors (nPOD) (for donor information, see Supplemental Table 2; because of the limited number of pregnant patient samples at nPOD, we decided to match the BMI of the patients with T2D cases with the pregnant cases because both are models of insulin resistance). Indeed, confocal microscopic analysis revealed a significant presence of insulin+ ductal cells in both pregnant and T2D patients (Figure 6, A and B). Quantification of islet clusters, as evidence of neogenesis (37), revealed an approximately 3-fold increase in small clusters located close to ductal epithelium in both pregnant and T2D groups compared with controls (Figure 6, C and D). Moreover, while pancreatic islets adherent to CK19+ ductal cells tended to increase in pregnancy (P = 0.07), they reached statistical significance in T2D samples (Figure 6, E and F). Interestingly, we observed insulin and glucagon double-positive clusters that appeared to be budding from ducts (Figure 6G), and CK19+ ducts were positive for multiple islet endocrine hormones (Figure 6H) in both pregnant and female T2D cadaver samples, similar to a previous report on distal pancreatectomy in humans (41). Consistent with the mouse data (Figure 2D), analysis of pregnancy samples showed an increase in small islet clusters adjacent or closely localized to pancreatic ducts compared with nonpregnant controls (control 3.17% vs. pregnant 23.54%, P = 0.017) (Figure 6I). Finally, to provide additional evidence of β cell proliferation in response to insulin resistance, we screened pancreas sections from human control, pregnant, and T2D patients obtained from nPOD (for donor information, see Supplemental Table 2). Although β cell replication detected by Ki67 immunostaining was minimal in controls and virtually absent in T2D, the frequency was higher in pregnant patients during the last trimester. Although the total number of patients in the pregnancy group is limited and precludes statistical significance, it is notable that β cell proliferation correlates with the duration of pregnancy (Supplemental Figure 10, A and B).Figure 6Presence of markers of endocrine progenitors and mature β cells in duct cells and increased numbers of small islet clusters in human pregnant and T2D samples.

(J–M) Human pancreas sections coimmunostained for CK19 and SOX9 (J), PDX1 (K), PAX6 (L), or MAFA (M). White arrows point to ductal cells positive for given markers. Scale bars: 25 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, and ***P &lt; 0.001.Presence of endocrine differentiation markers in ducts in pregnant and T2D patients. We next explored whether the ductal cells in sections from human cadaver pancreas showed presence of endocrine pancreatic differentiation markers similar to the experiment with the human islet and duct grafts (Figure 5, D–H). Coimmunostaining for human duct–specific CK19 and SOX9 showed nuclear staining for SOX9 in control cases while insulin-resistant samples showed ductal cells predominantly negative for SOX9 (Figure 6J). Although we did not detect any PDX1+ or PAX6+ ductal cells in controls, they were clearly increased in insulin-resistant individuals (Figure 6, K and L). Finally, the mature β cell marker, MAFA, was detected only in the ducts from the pregnant group (Figure 6M). These results suggest that, during increased insulin demand such as physiological or pathophysiological insulin resistance, ductal cells are mobilized to attain a β cell identity.",https://t.co/npp6R95klh,others
Endothelial Adora2a activation promotes blood-brain barrier breakdown and cognitive impairment in mice with diet-induced insulin resistance,"AbstractObesity and insulin resistance elicit blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in humans and animal models, but the relative contributions of the two pathologies remain poorly understood. These studies initially addressed the temporal progression of cerebrovascular dysfunction relative to dietary obesity or diet-induced insulin resistance in male mice. Obesity increased BBB permeability to the low molecular weight fluorophore sodium fluorescein (NaFl), while diet-induced insulin resistance increased permeability to both NaFl and Evans Blue, which forms a high molecular weight complex with serum albumin. Serial section transmission electron microscopy analysis of hippocampal capillaries revealed that diabetes promotes involution of tight junctions, fenestration of endothelial cells, and pericyte regression. Chronic activation of adenosine receptor 2a (Adora2a) erodes tight junctions between endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature in other models of chronic neuropathology, and we observed that acute Adora2a antagonism normalized BBB permeability in wildtype (Wt) mice with diet-induced insulin resistance. Experiments in mice with inducible deletion of Adora2a in endothelial cells revealed protection against BBB breakdown with diet-induced insulin resistance, despite comparable metabolic dysfunction relative to nontransgenic littermates. Protection against BBB breakdown was associated with decreased vascular inflammation, recovery of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and restoration of hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in vascular endothelial cells disrupts the BBB in dietary obesity, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the underlying mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and insulin resistance.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of circulating factors into the brain, but obesity promotes BBB breakdown in humans and animal models. We used transgenic mice with resistance to BBB breakdown to investigate the role of neurovascular dysfunction in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive impairment. Transgenic mice with inducible ablation of Adora2a in endothelial cells were protected against BBB breakdown on HFD, despite comparable metabolic impairments relative to normal mice. Transgenic mice were also resistant to HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction and were protected against deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in endothelial cells mediates obesity-induced BBB breakdown, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and diabetes.FootnotesThe authors declare no competing financial interests.This work was supported by grants R01DK110586 and K01DK100616 from the NIH to A.M.S.

Differential effects of diet- and genetically-induced brain insulin resistance on amyloid pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"The pathophysiological link between T2DM and AD is receiving increasing attention. Previous studies have suggested a possible involvement of insulin resistance, a core feature of T2DM, in the exacerbation of cognitive decline and pathology of AD [8, 16, 17]. In this study, we have addressed the questions on the chronological changes, causal relationships, and the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance and amyloid pathology in a mouse model of AD with metabolic and genetic interventions.In this study using A7-Tg mice, increased plasma insulin and blood glucose levels were observed as early as 2 months after initiation of HFD feeding on 3-month-old A7-Tg mice. In these mice, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IR in the brain was suppressed compared to that in chow-fed mice (Fig. 1e). Defective brain insulin response was still evident in 9-month-old HFD-fed A7-Tg mice (Fig. 1f), indicating that chronic HFD exposure led to impaired insulin signaling both in the periphery and in the brain.""Brain insulin resistance"" could be due to either impaired response of brain cells to the extracellular insulin or disrupted transport of insulin to the brain [22]. Impaired response of brain cells was suggested by insulin stimulation assays of the brain tissues in vitro [8, 39]. With regard to the brain entry of insulin, the effect of metabolic overload on the insulin transport from blood to the brain parenchyma has remained unclear. We demonstrated that the ISF/plasma insulin ratio during the hyperinsulinemic clamp was reduced in HFD-fed A7-Tg mice (Fig. 1j). Decreased ratio of insulin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to plasma has previously been shown in insulin resistant conditions in humans and dogs [40–42], although it remains elusive if the changes in CSF recapitulate that in brain ISF. A few attempts to directly measure ISF insulin in the rat hypothalamus using the microdialysis technique showed that a meal or peripheral insulin infusion affected the levels of hypothalamic ISF insulin [43, 44]. It has also been shown in APP transgenic mice that an acute and modest elevation of the levels of peripheral insulin has no effect on the levels of ISF insulin [45]. However, it remained unknown whether the ISF insulin levels are altered under metabolic abnormalities within brain areas affected in AD, e.g., hippocampus and cerebral neocortices. Although multiple physiological processes other than insulin action might have been affected during the hyperinsulinemic clamp, and the quantitation of the basal ISF insulin levels should have enabled a more precise determination of the changes in brain insulin transport, our current observations under the condition of hyperinsulinemic clamp support the hypothesis that defective insulin transport to the brain might be one of the underlying mechanisms of diet-induced brain insulin resistance. Similar mechanisms have been suggested in the skeletal muscle, where HFD-induced impairment of insulin signaling in the endothelial cells contributed to the delayed insulin delivery to the interstitial space [46]. Whether impairment in insulin signaling in brain vessels contributes to the HFD-induced reduction in insulin transport to the brain should further be examined.Time-course analyses in HFD-fed A7-Tg mice showed no changes in the levels of brain Aβ at 5 months of age when diet-induced insulin resistance was already observed, which was followed by increases in soluble and insoluble Aβ at 9 months of age (Fig. 2). These results suggested that the development of insulin resistance precedes that of Aβ accumulation. We therefore regarded the age of 9 months as the critical period of HFD-accelerated amyloid deposition in our A7-Tg model mice, when biochemical levels of brain Aβ, but not Aβ deposition, started to increase.In view of the potential application of dietary interventions as therapeutic/preventive strategies for AD, it is critical to know whether T2DM-induced exacerbation of AD pathology is a reversible process. We therefore explored the efficacy of dietary interventions starting at a defined pathological stage of amyloid pathology in HFD-fed A7-Tg mice. Previously, caloric restriction and diet switching after HFD feeding have been shown to reduce amyloid deposition in AD model mice [36, 37, 47, 48]. In the current study, we systematically examined the effect of dietary interventions after the onset of HFD-induced insulin resistance and an increase in brain insoluble Aβ. Feeding the HFD followed by the chow diet significantly suppressed the effects of HFD feeding on insulin resistance and Aβ deposition, and HFD feeding followed by CR had more pronounced effects (Fig. 4). Altogether, these results suggested the positive and reversible correlation between the diet-induced peripheral/brain insulin resistance and brain amyloid pathology during the early stages of AD pathophysiology. The association between T2DM and amyloid pathology has been supported by studies focusing on the effects of insulin resistance in the late middle-aged population (45–64 years old) [18], with lesser effects in older population [49]. Thus, components of T2DM, e.g., insulin resistance, might affect the rate of Aβ deposition during the very early, preclinical stage of AD, which dovetails with our observation in our AD model mice that recapitulate the early stage of AD pathophysiology.Previous studies in multiple AD mouse models have altogether shown the exacerbation of amyloid pathology by diet-induced metabolic abnormalities. In some models, changes in enzymes responsible for either Aβ degradation (IDE, neprilysin) or production (secretases) have been documented [19, 47, 50]. However, the mechanisms of increase in Aβ deposition were not consistently elucidated, and changes in the Aβ-related enzymes or APP fragments were not detected in our present study. We have for the first time examined the in vivo dynamics of brain ISF Aβ under HFD feeding using the brain microdialysis, and found that HFD feeding significantly extended the half-life of ISF Aβ in A7-Tg mice of 9-months-old, a critical age for Aβ accumulation (Fig. 3k). It has been suggested that the levels and the half-life of ISF Aβ might be affected by the presence of amyloid plaques in aged AD model mice [30, 51]; however, we might have minimized such an effect of insoluble Aβ pools that could affect the equilibrium with ISF Aβ in the plaque-free 9-month-old A7-Tg brains. No differences in ISF Aβ levels and clearance at 5 months of age was consistent with the lack of changes in Aβ levels by biochemical analysis (Fig. 3g), supporting the idea that decreased Aβ clearance that become evident by 9 months of age contributed to the accelerated amyloid pathology in the brains of our HFD-fed mice. In addition to the proteolytic digestion, the involvement of glial and vascular factors has been implicated in the clearance mechanisms of Aβ [52, 53]. Further study is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of diet-induced reduction in Aβ clearance.Although a series of experiments in HFD-fed A7-Tg mice has suggested the causal relationship between insulin resistance and amyloid pathology, it is difficult to discriminate the effects of individual changes associated with diet-induced insulin resistance, e.g., hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and reduced insulin action, on the Aβ pathology. To address this issue, we examined IRS-2-deficient A7-Tg mice as an alternative ""insulin-resistant"" mouse model. Irs2−/− mice develop T2DM-like systemic phenotypes due to the reduced insulin action primarily in the liver and pancreatic β cells [28, 54]. IRS-2 expressed in the brain has been shown to play important roles in the regulation of food intake and peripheral insulin sensitivity, and could therefore be attributed to the development of diabetic phenotypes of Irs2−/− mice [55]. Despite the pro-diabetic nature of the IRS-2 deletion, brains of Irs2−/−;A7-Tg mice accumulated lesser amount of amyloid plaques compared to that of A7-Tg mice (Fig. 5e), consistent with the earlier studies in Tg2576 mice lacking IRS-2 [23, 24], as well as in genetic disruption of neuronal insulin receptor [56] or IGF-1R [23, 26]. One possible mechanism underlying these alleviated phenotypes on amyloid deposition might be linked to the beneficial properties of reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling for longevity, which have been extensively studied in a variety of organisms [57]. In contrast, insulin has been shown to increase the Aβ levels in cell culture studies [58, 59]. Overall, these lines of evidence suggest a suppressive role of reduced insulin signaling in Aβ accumulation. Another possible mechanism of the anti-amyloidgenic effect of Irs2 deletion could be due to a compensatory activation of the other downstream pathway, i.e., IRS-1 signaling axis, although the functional diversity of signaling pathways via IRS-1 and IRS-2 in brains has not been fully characterized. Future experiments should reveal the specific changes in the downstream signaling of each IRS protein in the brains of Irs2−/−;A7-Tg mice.Given the paradoxical results of the two independent ""insulin resistant"" AD mouse models, an important problem emerges whether the defective insulin signaling pathway is causative to the reduced amyloid pathology. To gain insights into the interplay between the genetically induced reduction in insulin signaling and metabolic stress, we have loaded HFD on Irs2−/−;A7-Tg mice and found an accelerating effect on amyloid accumulation in brains (Fig. 6f and g). The adverse effect of diet overloading on the development of insulin resistance was cumulative and not cancelled by IRS-2 deficiency. These findings led us to speculate that the diet-induced insulin resistance and its upstream causes, but not the reduced insulin action per se, is the mechanism accelerating the amyloid pathophysiology in vivo.Among the known upstream events of impaired insulin signaling in metabolic overload or T2DM, we observed that the degrees of inflammation and ER stress signaling in adipose tissue were significantly elevated by HFD feeding (Fig. 5f). IRS-2-deficient A7-Tg mice developed diabetic phenotype without causing the elevation of inflammatory/stress responses, whereas HFD feeding increased the activity of these signaling pathways (Fig. 6e). Inflammation and ER stress are known to be key to the cause of insulin resistance [60], and recent studies have shown that the upregulation of inflammation and ER stress in the hypothalamus also contributes to the obesity-associated insulin resistance [61]. These inflammation and ER stress pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD as well [62]. Further study is needed to unravel the possible involvement of the diet-induced inflammatory and stress signaling in brains in the diet-induced exacerbation of amyloid pathophysiology.",https://t.co/P3jOOuYD5u,others

11 Reasons Why Berries Are Among the Healthiest Foods on Earth,"By Franziska Spritzler, RD, CDEBerries are among the healthiest foods you can eat.They're delicious, nutritious, and provide a number of impressive health benefits.Here are 11 good reasons to include berries in your diet. 1. Loaded With Antioxidants Berries contain antioxidants, which help keep free radicals under control.Free radicals are unstable molecules that are beneficial in small amounts but can damage your cells when their numbers get too high, causing oxidative stress (1).Berries are a great source of antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol. In addition to protecting your cells, these plant compounds may reduce disease risk (2, 3).One study showed that blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries have the highest antioxidant activity of commonly consumed fruits, next to pomegranates (4).In fact, several studies have confirmed that the antioxidants in berries may help reduce oxidative stress (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).One study in healthy men found that consuming a single, 10-ounce (300-gram) portion of blueberries helped protect their DNA against free radical damage (8).In another study in healthy people, eating 17 ounces (500 grams) of strawberry pulp every day for 30 days decreased a pro-oxidant marker by 38% (9).SummaryBerries are high in antioxidants like anthocyanins, which may protect your cells from free radical damage. 2. May Help Improve Blood Sugar and Insulin Response Berries may improve your blood sugar and insulin levels.Test-tube and human studies suggest that they may protect your cells from high blood sugar levels, help increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce blood sugar and insulin response to high-carb meals (10, 11, 12, 13).Importantly, these effects appear to occur in both healthy people and those with insulin resistance.In one study in healthy women, eating 5 ounces (150 grams) of puréed strawberries or mixed berries with bread led to a 24–26% reduction in insulin levels, compared to consuming the bread alone (13).Moreover, in a six-week study, obese people with insulin resistance who drank a blueberry smoothie twice per day experienced greater improvements in insulin sensitivity than those who consumed berry-free smoothies (14).SummaryBerries may improve blood sugar and insulin response when consumed with high-carb foods or included in smoothies. 3. High in Fiber Berries are a good source of fiber, including soluble fiber. Studies show that consuming soluble fiber slows down the movement of food through your digestive tract, leading to reduced hunger and increased feelings of fullness.This may decrease your calorie intake and make weight management easier (15, 16).What's more, fiber helps reduce the number of calories you absorb from mixed meals. One study found that doubling your fiber intake could make you absorb up to 130 fewer calories per day (17).In addition, the high fiber content of berries means that they're low in digestible or net carbs, which are calculated by subtracting fiber from total carbs.Here are the carb and fiber counts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of berries (18, 19, 20, 21):Raspberries: 11.9 grams of carbs, 6.5 of which are fiberBlackberries: 10.2 grams of carbs, 5.3 of which are fiberStrawberries: 7.7 grams of carbs, 2.0 of which are fiberBlueberries: 14.5 grams of carbs, 2.4 of which are fiberNote that a typical serving size for berries is 1 cup, which converts to about 4.4–5.3 ounces (125–150 grams) depending on the type.Because of their low net carb content, berries are a low-carb-friendly food.SummaryBerries contain fiber, which may increase feelings of fullness, as well as reduce appetite and the number of calories your body absorbs from mixed meals. 4. Provide Many Nutrients Berries are low in calories and extremely nutritious. In addition to being high in antioxidants, they also contain several vitamins and minerals.Berries, especially strawberries, are high in vitamin C. In fact, 1 cup (150 grams) of strawberries provides a whopping 150% of the RDI for vitamin C (20).With the exception of vitamin C, all berries are fairly similar in terms of their vitamin and mineral content.Below is the nutrition content of a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of blackberries (19):Calories: 43Vitamin C: 35% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)Manganese: 32% of the RDIVitamin K1: 25% of the RDICopper: 8% of the RDIFolate: 6% of the RDIThe calorie count for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of berries ranges from 32 for strawberries to 57 for blueberries, making berries some of the lowest-calorie fruits around (20, 21).SummaryBerries are low in calories yet rich in several vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C and manganese. 5. Help Fight Inflammation Berries have strong anti-inflammatory properties.Inflammation is your body's defense against infection or injury.However, modern lifestyles often lead to excessive, long-term inflammation due to increased stress, inadequate physical activity, and unhealthy food choices.This type of chronic inflammation is believed to contribute to conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity (22, 23, 24).Studies suggest that the antioxidants in berries may help lower inflammatory markers (25, 26, 27, 28).In one study in overweight people, those drinking a strawberry beverage with a high-carb, high-fat meal noticed a more significant decrease in certain inflammatory markers than the control group (28).SummaryBerries may help reduce inflammation and decrease your risk of heart disease and other health problems. 6. May Help Lower Cholesterol Levels Berries are a heart-healthy food.Black raspberries and strawberries have been shown to help lower cholesterol in people who are obese or have metabolic syndrome (29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34).In an 8-week study, adults with metabolic syndrome who consumed a beverage made from freeze-dried strawberries daily experienced an 11% drop in LDL (bad) cholesterol (31).What's more, berries may help prevent LDL cholesterol from becoming oxidized or damaged, which is believed to be a major risk factor for heart disease (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37).In a controlled study in obese people, those eating 1.5 ounces (50 grams) of freeze-dried blueberries for 8 weeks noticed a 28% reduction in their oxidized LDL levels (37).SummaryBerries have been shown to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and help protect it from becoming oxidized, which may reduce your risk of heart disease. 7. May Be Good for Your Skin Berries may help reduce skin wrinkling, as their antioxidants help control free radicals, one of the leading causes of skin damage that contributes to aging (38).Though research is limited, ellagic acid appears responsible for some of the skin-related benefits of berries.Test-tube and animal studies suggest that this antioxidant may protect skin by blocking the production of enzymes that break down collagen in sun-damaged skin (39, 40, 41).Collagen is a protein that is part of your skin's structure. It allows your skin to stretch and remain firm. When collagen is damaged, your skin may sag and develop wrinkles.In one study, applying ellagic acid to the skin of hairless mice exposed to ultraviolet light for eight weeks decreased inflammation and helped protect collagen from damage (41).SummaryBerries contain the antioxidant ellagic acid, which may help decrease wrinkling and other signs of skin aging related to sun exposure. 8. May Help Protect Against Cancer Several antioxidants in berries, including anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol, may reduce cancer risk (42, 43, 44).Specifically, animal and human studies suggest that berries may protect against cancer of the esophagus, mouth, breast, and colon (45, 46, 47, 48, 49).In a study in 20 people with colon cancer, eating 2 ounces (60 grams) of freeze-dried raspberries for 1–9 weeks improved tumor markers in some participants, though not all (49).Another test-tube study found that all types of strawberries had strong, protective effects on liver cancer cells, regardless of whether they were high or low in antioxidants (50).SummaryBerries have been shown to reduce markers associated with tumor growth in animals and people with several types of cancer. 9. Can Be Enjoyed on Nearly All Types of Diets Berries can be included in many kinds of diets.Though people on low-carb and ketogenic diets often avoid fruit, you can usually enjoy berries in moderation.For example, a half-cup serving of blackberries (70 grams) or raspberries (60 grams) contains less than 4 grams of digestible carbs (18, 19).Liberal amounts of berries can be incorporated into paleo, Mediterranean, vegetarian, and vegan diets.For people who want to lose weight, the few calories in berries make them ideal to include in meals, snacks, or desserts.Organic and wild berries are now widely available in many parts of the world. When they're not in season, frozen berries can be purchased and thawed as needed.The only people who need to avoid berries are those who require a low-fiber diet for certain digestive disorders, as well as individuals who are allergic to berries. Allergic reactions to strawberries are most common.SummaryBerries can be enjoyed on most diets, as they're low in calories and carbs and widely available fresh or frozen. 10. May Help Keep Your Arteries Healthy In addition to lowering cholesterol, berries provide other benefits for heart health, including improving the function of your arteries.The cells that line your blood vessels are called endothelial cells. They help control blood pressure, keep blood from clotting, and perform other important functions.Excessive inflammation can damage these cells, inhibiting proper function. This is referred to as endothelial dysfunction, a major risk factor for heart disease (51).Berries have been found to improve endothelial function in studies in healthy adults, individuals with metabolic syndrome, and people who smoke (29, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56).In a controlled study in 44 people with metabolic syndrome, those consuming a daily blueberry smoothie showed significant improvements in endothelial function, compared to the control group (56).Though fresh berries are considered healthiest, berries in processed form may still provide some heart-healthy benefits. Baked berry products are considered processed, whereas freeze-dried berries are not.One study found that although baking blueberries reduced their anthocyanin content, total antioxidant concentrations remained the same. Arterial function improved similarly in people who consumed baked or freeze-dried berries (57).SummaryBerries have been found to improve arterial function in several studies in healthy people, those with metabolic syndrome, and people who smoke. 11. Delicious Alone or in Healthy Recipes Berries are undeniably delicious. They make a wonderful snack or dessert, whether you use one type or a mix of two or more.Though they're naturally sweet and require no additional sweetener, adding a bit of heavy or whipped cream can transform them into a more elegant dessert.For breakfast, try berries topped with either plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or ricotta cheese, along with some chopped nuts.Another way to include berries in your diet is as part of a salad.To discover the nearly endless versatility of berries, browse the internet for healthy recipes.SummaryBerries are delicious when served alone, with cream, or in healthy recipes. The Bottom Line Berries taste great, are highly nutritious, and provide many health benefits, including for your heart and skin.By including them in your diet on a regular basis, you can improve your overall health in a very enjoyable way.

Reverse Engineering the Mystery,"For quite a while I've been wanting to test a theory I've had regarding the blood test for oxidized LDL (oxLDL). The test has some research behind it suggesting a correlation with heart disease, which makes sense given this association of oxLDL in the artery walls and atherogenesis.There's an assumption that oxLDL will track with oxidative stress in the body. But I've long had the hypothesis oxLDL will track with LDL particle count (LDL-P). For example:Deeper Mechanistic ReasonsIn a previous draft of this blog post I go into my lengthy reasons for why this makes sense to me, but I think I'll save that for later as some of it is a bit controversial.But I'll tease part of the answer can be suggested by this tweet:Designing the ExperimentSo is there a way to increase LDL-P while keeping oxidative stress roughly the same or even lower? Why yes, we use the Inversion Pattern.Eat baseline diet for five days, wide spectrum test + oxLDLEat 1/2 baseline diet for five days, wide spectrum test + oxLDLEat 2X baseline diet for five days, wide spectrum test + oxLDLThe hypothesis: oxLDL will track with LDL-P. It will go up with LDL-P goes up and drop when LDL-P drops. If oxLDL has little to no movement or tracks inversely, this would be clear evidence against it.In other words, if LDL-P increases from phase 1 to 2, and drops from phase 2 to 3, we should see similar movements with oxLDL.Unexpected Amendment at Phase 3While I did caveat in advance I might not be able to hit the Phase 3 goal of doing twice my baseline diet, I quickly found out my fear was met. Pretty quickly I realized I couldn't consume that much food that quickly. See my video on this as it happened here:VIDEOThus, I compensated the difference with some Keto Chow shakes which allowed me to move up my levels a lot faster. (Full disclosure, Keto Chow provides us product support for experiments, but we draw no financial compensation from the company or have an agreement with it of any kind) There were also additional circumstantial stressors in that last phase unrelated to the experiment, so I made note of this too and how it may be a confounder as well.Process WoesAs an aside, getting this testing was both expensive and extra cumbersome. The lab I was getting by regular tests through didn't allow for Boston Heart blood to be taken, so I had to make other arrangements to get the blood drawn and spun separately on that test. Then I had to pack it in ice myself and take it to FedEx to ship immediately afterward.As experiments go, this one has a lot of planning and footwork to pull off by comparison.The Thrill of AnticipationThe first test rolled in and these results would now serve as baseline.Okay, 88 it is.While waiting for the second test, I happened to be in the area of the clinic I was getting these labs through and dropped by. ""Hey, any chance you got that second oxLDL test?""""Actually, we got the email notification this morning. We'll print it out."" Said the administrative assistant.""Great!"" I felt a wave of excitement hit me. ""Before I see it,"" I began, staring at the printer, ""I predict the number will be higher than the test on the 12th before it.""The sheet finally popped out and the assistant handed it to me. ""YES!"" I shouted, and then suddenly dialed it back, self-consciously remembering I'm in a doctor's office. ""Sorry.""Certainly 128 was an incredible change for a five day difference. The effect size was more than I could have hoped for to test the hypothesis.I was already out of town at the moment the last test came in. When I let the admin know I wanted her to send it over via email, she said, ""Awww, we were hoping you'd see it in person here for the reaction."" We both chuckled.Wow! 75 at the low. And again, this is just five days from the prior phase endpoint at 128.Now again, I have to be intellectually honest. That last phase could have been confounded by the unexpected stressors and my having to add on Keto Chow to reach the caloric surplus. It could be posited one or both of these further impacted the outcome. Probably a stretch, but worth the mention. FindingsUnsurprisingly, this is the tightest regression line I've ever posted.To be sure, there were many runner ups that had less correlation, yet still in the 90s. Here's the big rundown of both the diet and blood markers:Final ThoughtsNeedless to say, I was quite happy to finally have this experiment completed and ecstatic at the outcome data. While the correlation with LDL-P was something I've predicted for some time, I'll concede it was far tighter than I was imagining. I have many other thoughts on oxLDL which I'll save for another time. But the biggest takeaway is how clearly dynamic this marker is, along with just about every other lipid that is central to the research of this site.",https://t.co/QPG7E0mqfp,others
"Visiting Mexico, asking strangers: Diabetics scramble for costly insulin","Mike Lawson will never forget how he ended up in the hospital 12 years ago when he had to decide between making a $300 car payment or buying insulin. ""I made a stupid choice,"" said Lawson, an Oakland resident who has Type 1 diabetes. ""That month I chose to pay for my car payment and to ration insulin."" These days, the price of insulin skyrocketing, and he is stockpiling the drug. Through Twitter, Lawson recently connected with a stranger who said she had four leftover bottles after switching brands. The two exchanged messages and met near her San Francisco office. Letting insulin go to waste ""is almost like tossing gold,"" Lawson said. The price of three commonly used insulin products has increased substantially in recent years. From 2013 to 2019, the cost of NovoLog nearly doubled, going from $289 to $540 per carton, according to according to letters sent in February to drug manufacturers by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating insulin prices. Another common drug, Lantus, rose in price from $244 to $431, the committee said. (The drug's maker, Sanofi, says the numbers rose from $228 to $425 over that time period, but the amount paid to the company actually fell 25% after Sanofi paid rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.) A vial of Humalog, a third popular insulin drug, cost $35 in 2001 and by 2015 had risen to $234, according to the Senate committee. And so, worried about cost, diabetics such as Lawson are increasingly seeking new ways to get, give away or exchange insulin cheaply or for free. Some are using unofficial channels on the internet. Others are traveling to Mexico, where pharmacies sell some popular types of insulin for a fraction of their cost in the United States. Lawson, who now is able to get insulin for a moderate price through insurance even though he still seeks out extra, has also given away some of his insulin to local strangers in need, who find him through Twitter by searching hashtags like #T1D (Type 1 diabetes) and #insulin4all. For the roughly 1.5 million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, the amount of money patients spent on insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $240 to $475 a month, according to a January report from the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care data. And spending in 2017 continued to rise, experts said. ""The risk isn't only that people are being trapped in debt,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, tweeted last weekend. ""Americans have actually died from diabetic ketoacidosis because they had to ration or skip their doses. We need to rein in Big Pharma greed to save lives."" Many stories have emerged nationwide about people who, like Lawson, rationed or delayed buying insulin because they could not afford it, often leading to deadly and dangerous results. About 1 in 4 diabetes patients uses less insulin than prescribed because of costs, according to a 2018 Yale University study. ""It's not just anecdotal, this is relatively widespread,"" said the study co-author Dr. Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. ""There are lots of patients having difficulty affording their insulin."" But why is insulin, which is naturally produced by the pancreas and first discovered for medical use nearly a century ago, so expensive? The scientists who invented it in 1923 sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto for the purpose of making it accessible. But the way the drug is produced and delivered to the body has changed significantly since then. Insulin was initially isolated from animal pancreases, but today it is made by inserting the human insulin gene into bacteria, producing the insulin protein, and then purifying it. Insulin is derived from live organisms and put through a complex process to become a medicine — so it's hard for a competing drug company to make a generic version of it. A handful of drug manufacturers have essentially patented the processes for creating modern-day insulin products just enough to keep exclusive patents under their name, experts said. Only three drug companies sell insulin in the United States: Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk. ""Some of the insulins have dozens of patents on them even though the active ingredient patent has expired,"" said Jeannie Biniek, a health economist who co-wrote the Health Care Cost Institute report. ""There's a question of whether these additional patents are providing a justified return on the investment or, if at some point, they are just providing the company the opportunity to maintain a monopoly on the market."" And, as is the case with many prescription drugs, it's not clear how the ""list price"" of insulin — what a patient would have to pay out of pocket for it, if they do not have insurance — is determined because negotiations between drug companies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers about who pays what are considered proprietary. Drug companies say lowering the list price wouldn't necessarily lead to lower costs for consumers because part of the list price gets paid to pharmacy benefit managers. In recent weeks, amid growing pressure from Congress, the drug companies and some insurers have announced plans to make insulin more affordable. But they fall short of many consumers' expectations. Eli Lilly, which makes Humalog, announced in March it will offer a half-price version of the popular fast-acting insulin for $137 per vial, but has not said when it will be available. A Lilly spokesman said the company also offers a free hotline that consumers can call for information about out-of-pocket reductions at the pharmacy and clinics where donated insulin is available. In April, hours before Sanofi executives were set to testify before a congressional committee on rising insulin prices, the company announced it will sell its insulin products for a fixed price of $99 a month, for up to 10 vials or boxes of insulin pens, to patients paying with cash. Patients who have commercial health insurance are eligible for co-pay cards that may lower their out-of-pocket expenses, a Sanofi spokesman said. Last year, 246,000 people used the co-pay cards and paid nothing or $10 a month for their Sanofi insulin, he said. Sanofi also provides free insulin for low-income uninsured patients who make about $30,000 a year or less. Novo Nordisk has provided free insulin to tens of thousands of uninsured people with diabetes since 2003 and spends $200 million each year on co-pay assistance to patients with commercial health plans. ""We know how challenging it is for a growing number of Americans with diabetes to afford their medicines, including the ones we make,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesman said. ""As a company focused on improving the lives of people with diabetes, this is not acceptable."" Cigna and Express Scripts, which recently merged, announced that they would cap out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $25 a month for patients whose pharmacy plans are managed by Express Scripts. Up to 700,000 people who are on employer-sponsored plans are eligible to receive this benefit if their employer decides to opt in. ""I'm glad to see the mounting pressure and public outcry are having an impact in Lilly releasing this generic and Cigna capping spending, but that's not enough,"" said Lipska, of Yale. ""Those are Band-Aid solutions that don't resolve the underlying issue of very high prices for these insulins."" Indeed, the discount and savings programs aren't reaching everyone. Sabella Larkin of San Diego said she has had to buy insulin in Mexico three times — once in Tijuana and twice in Rosarito. The first time was several years ago, when she was a college student in Texas, while working full time at a tanning salon and struggling to pay her bills. Her insurance at the time wouldn't cover an insulin refill until a certain date, and she couldn't wait. One of her customers at the salon lent her $200 to buy an insulin pen. ""Two weeks later when I got paid, I tried to reimburse her and she said no,"" said Larkin, 28. ""Being in that situation, that's when I went to Mexico and happened to see the insulin I take. It was only $20. I literally cried."" Larkin said she has purchased both NovoLog and Lantus in Mexico for $20 to $25, for the same amount of insulin that would have cost her hundreds of dollars at U.S. pharmacies. ""It was life changing,"" she said. ""It was this added security across the border."" Catherine Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

"Glycemic response to low sugar apple juice treated with invertase, glucose oxidase and catalase","DesignThe study was a cross-over, mono-centric, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (Fig. 1). The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02542033). The study received approval (AZ 046/15) from an independent ethics committee (The Ethical Committee of the Medical Council of Schleswig-Holstein, Bad Segeberg, Germany)VolunteersVolunteers were recruited from the database of the study site and from advertisements.Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before any study-specific procedure was performed. 30 male volunteers were included fulfilling the following eligibility criteria: age ≥ 18 y, diagnosed impaired fasting plasma glucose (5.6–6.9 mmol/l) [8]. Main exclusion criteria were: food allergy, acute or chronic infections, renal insufficiency, gastrointestinal illness or surgery, fructose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, a disease or condition which might compromise significantly any body system except for a condition defined by the inclusion criteria. Individuals withdrawing or discontinuing prematurely were replaced.Random sequence generation and allocation concealmentVolunteers were randomly assigned to either verum first, and then control product, or vice versa. To avoid selection bias, randomisation was generated independently according to the Cochrane guidelines [9]. The randomisation list was kept confidential apart from those involved in product production (Nofima AS).Test products and blinding of participants and personnelPasteurized conventional apple juice used as control was produced by Askim Frukt - og Bærpresseri AS, Askim, Norway. Composition of this juice is shown in Table 2. For verum sugar depleted apple juice was manufactured as follows with all enzymes and processing aids commercially available and EU approved as food grade. Control apple juice (95 l) was transferred to a kettle with lid, mixing, heating and cooling options (Proline Touch-Mix, Classic Gastro A/S, Denmark). The juice was warmed to 85 °C and held there for 5 min and then cooled to 24 °C. Invertase (Maxinvert L10000, DSM) was added (5000 U/l) to split sucrose overnight at room temperature (ca. 18–21 °C). Next morning the content of sucrose was &lt;0.01 g/l. To regulate pH prior to glucose oxidase/catalase treatment calcium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide were added. Glucose oxidase/catalase (Hyderase L, Amano/Mitsubishi, Japan) were added (3000 U/l) with simultaneous addition of molecular oxygen to maintain a constant supply into the reaction tank of 3 mg/l. pH was maintained at 3.6–4.6 by batch addition of solid calcium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. An incubation of 12 h at room temperature was enough to convert almost all glucose to gluconic acid (glucose 0.1 g/l; Table 2). At the end of the incubation, enzyme activity was terminated by stopping the oxygen supply. Glucose was monitored by a reflectometric kit (Reflectoquant, Merck) and HPLC. Sucrose content after invertase incubation was also measured in this way (&lt;0.1 g/l; Table 2). Gluconate was determined via enzymatic assay (R-Biopharm). Prior to such analysis, all enzymes were irreversibly denatured by boiling. The organoleptic properties were optimized by further addition of calcium and/or potassium hydroxide. The final pH of the mixture was approximately 4. It was pasteurised in a KTM-Troxler (Ettenheim, Germany) pasteur and bottled hot into identical 500 ml brown glass bottles, capped, cooled, labelled by coding with consecutive numbers according to the randomization protocol and stored in a fridge (1–4 °C) prior to shipment to the study site. Verum and control were similar in flavour, colour, texture, and appearance and identical in packaging throughout the study. The components of bottled juice (treated and untreated) were analysed by Eurofins Analytics, Nantes, France, a certified laboratory.The study site ensured that the study products were stored according to the instructions given by the producer (Nofima AS, Ås, Norway) and kept in a secured location (fridge) to which only the investigator and designated study staff had access. Dispensing of study products was recorded in a product accountability log. Monitoring of product accountability was performed by the quality manager after the visits and at the end of the trial. Code-breaking systems were available in case of an adverse event.Procedure/conductAfter giving the informed consent, the medical history, concomitant medication and alimentary supplements were assessed at screening visit (V0) and fasting state was ascertained. Furthermore, vital signs and anthropometric data were collected. If all inclusion and no exclusion parameters were fulfilled the volunteer was enrolled into the study. Volunteers were requested to attend the next visit after an overnight fast of at least 12 h and provided with a diary for daily reply regarding adverse event and medication and with a questionnaire (EPIC FFQ) for recalling food frequency over the last 12 months, to be completed before the randomisation visit. Impaired fasting glucose was confirmed by two independent measurements (one from prior screenings during the preceding two years) and another at V0).Interventional visit 1 (V1) followed V0 within four weeks. Any adverse events since V0 were documented. If eligibility was confirmed the subject was randomised. Fasting for at least 12 h prior to this visit was checked and an intravenous catheter (Vasofix® Braunüle® 18 G, Braun Melsungen, Germany) was inserted into a forearm vein for blood withdrawal at baseline, directly before ingestion of test product (time point 0). The bottle was shaken well, opened and its entire contents were ingested (500 ml) by each volunteer within 5 min. The time point of ingestion was kept consistent between visit 1 and visit 2 in each individual and was in all cases between 8:00 and 8:40 a.m. At 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after starting the ingestion a venous blood sample was collected. Serum was separated within 60 min and stored at −20 °C until venous serum insulin concentration was determined using a chemoluminescence immunoassay (Liaison®), DiaSorin S.p.A., Saluggia, Italy).From the venous blood samples taken at baseline and 120 min after consumption of the test product safety parameters were determined on the day of blood withdrawal (serum Na, K, Ca, Mg, AST, ALT, γGT, CHE, AP, LDH, CK, bilirubin, creatinine, urea-N, uric acid, complete blood count, cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, hsCRP). All laboratory parameters were determined in a certified laboratory (Laboratory Dr. Krause &amp; Colleagues MVZ GmbH, Kiel, Germany) using a Beckman Coulter AU analyser. Na and K were determined with selective electrodes. Ca was determined by photometry using arsenazo III as complexing agent and Mg using xylidylblue as complexing agent, AST by photometry measuring NADH after transamination of aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate to L-glutamate and oxaloacetate and reaction of the oxalacetate to L-malate catalysed by malate dehydrogenase, ALT by measuring NADH after transamination of alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to pyruvate and glutamate and reduction of pyruvate by LDH, yGT by photometric measurement of 5-amino-2-nitrobenzoate resulting from catalysis of gamma-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-nitroanlide to glycylglycine, ALP by measuring p-nitrophenol at 410/480 nm resulting from the conversion of p-nitro-phenylphosphate, cholinesterase by detecting yellow hexacyanoferrate (III) is reduced by thiocholine to colourless hexacyanoferrate (II) after catalysis of the hydrolysis of butyrylthiocholine to butyrate and thiocholine, LDH by measuring NADH at 340 nm resulting from oxidation of lactate to pyruvate and the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, CK by measuring NADPH resulting from the catalysis of CK, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, uric acid by detecting a blue dye resulting from the H2O2 reaction with N,N-bis(4-sulfobutyl)-3,5-dimethylaniline and 4-aminophenazone under catalysis by uricase and peroxidase, urea-N by detecting NAD+ resulting from the catalysis of urease and the GLDH catalyzed reaction of 2-Oxoglutarate + 2 NH4+ + 2 NADH, creatinine by measuring a dye generated by catalysis through creatininase, creatinase, sarcosine oxidase and peroxidase, bilirubin by measuring azobilirubin after conjugation with 3,5-dichlorphenyl-diazonium-tetrafluorborate, HDL-C by quantification of cholesterol by an enzyme chromogen system after blocking enzymatic reaction with lipoproteins other than HDL (LDL, VLDL and chylomicrons) through anti-human-β-lipoprotein antibody, LDL-C by a homogeneous assay using an enzymatic selective protection method, triglycerides by detecting a chromophore produced in reactions catalyzed by lipases, glycerol kinase, glycerol phosphate oxidase and peroxidase, and hsCRP by turbimetric quantification of CRP bound to rabbit anti-CRP-antibodies coated on latex particles.Fingerprick capillary blood glucose was measured instantaneously using an HemoCue® 201 analyzer (Radiometer GmbH, Willich, Germany) at the same time frequency intervals as for venous serum insulin.Arterial blood pressure, pulse and waist circumference (as marker of abdominal bloating) was assessed before and 120 min after ingestion of the test product. Volunteers completed validated questionnaires on gastrointestinal symptoms, the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) [10,11,12], which allows scoring of symptoms in 5 dimensions depicting abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, constipation and diarrhoea syndrome, as well as a total symptom score based on standardized questions. The GSRS was assessed at time point 0 with regard to the previous three days and for the last h before starting ingestion. It was also assessed at time points 60 and 120 min with respect to the period 0–60 min and 60–120 min, respectively. Stool frequency and stool form (Bristol Stool Scale) over the previous 3 days and previous 2 h [13] was self-assessed by the subject (questionnaires) directly also at time point 0. At 120 min time point these parameters were assessed again with respect to the previous 2 h.Satiety, hunger, fullness and prospective food consumption were monitored during the visit by subject self-assessment at time point 0 as well as at time points 30, 60, 90 and 120 min using validated questionnaires [14, 15]. In these questionnaires visual analogue scales (VAS) were used, each with 100 mm in length and with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. Volunteers could walk around at the study site, sit or lay down, but asked to abstain from eating, drinking or exercising during the test phase. The volunteers were surveyed during the whole observation period at the test day and adverse events were monitored. After the 2 h test period volunteers were provided with a diary for daily assessment of adverse events and medication. GSRS, stool frequency and stool form were assessed during the three-day lasting observation period starting with ingestion of the test drink at visit day V1 and two subsequent days.Interventional visit 2 (V2) was scheduled on the seventh day after V1 at the earliest. Volunteers were requested to return their diaries and questionnaires. Adverse events since V1 were documented. Fasting for 12 h prior to V2 was checked and the test was conducted as described for V1. Again, volunteers were provided with a diary for daily assessment of the sample parameters as at V1. Volunteers received a stamped envelope and were requested to send back their diaries and completed questionnaires. The first volunteer was selected on 20 May 2015, the first subject inclusion was on 28 May 2015 and the last visit of the last randomised subject was on 30 July 2015.Outcome measuresThe incremental area under the curve (iAUC120) of the fingerprick capillary blood glucose levels from baseline to 120 min after ingestion of the test drinks was defined as the primary outcome. Although fingerprick capillary and venous blood glucose values have been shown to be highly correlated, fingerprick capillary blood samples are regarded preferable for reliable GI testing [16, 17]. Therefore, glucose was determined using the HemoCue® 201 analyzer), which had been tested for glycemic index (GI) assessment [18]. The iAUC was calculated according to Wolever, 2006 [19] ignoring the area under the baseline. The iAUC of the venous serum insulin levels from baseline to 120 min after ingestion (iAUC120) of the test drinks was defined as the secondary parameter.Exploratory outcome measures included the iAUC (iAUC60) of glucose and venous serum insulin levels from baseline to 60 min after ingestion of the test drinks, the postprandial glucose peak (Gmax), the amplitude between baseline and Gmax (Gmax−Gbase), and the maximal amplitude of glucose excursions (Gmax−Gmin) were calculated for further characterization of postprandial glucose response [20]. Proportional reduction in glucose load [21] was calculated by 100−100(iAUC120verum × CHverum)/(iAUC120control × CHcontrol), whereby CH was carbohydrate (sugar) content of verum (86.4 g) and control (109 g), respectively. Postprandial venous serum insulin sensitivity was expressed by ISI = 2/[AUC120 venous serum insulin × AUC120glucose +1 ] [22, 23]. Satiety, hunger, fullness and prospective food uptake were assessed before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after ingestion of test drinks according to [14, 15]. The score values of each of these four sensations, as well as their iAUC120, were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures (ANOVA RM).Statistical analysisThe results were expressed as mean ± SD, whereas mean ± SEM were shown in the figures, in order to better fit to the format of figures. Since no previous iAUC data were available for apple juice, sample size estimation was based on literature data [24]. After a 25 g glucose load the authors found an iAUC30 = 55.6 ± 20.4 (mean ± SEM) of glycemic response (GR). We expected a reduction in GR by at least 30% by enzymatic treatment of the juice resulting in a reduction of iAUC by 16.7. Further assuming a standard deviation of 23.0, a power of 0.95 and α = 0.05, a sample size of N = 27 was calculated for paired t-test. A sample size of N = 30 was therefore defined for the trial.To meet the Cochrane Collaboration recommendations for preventing detection bias [9] blinding of outcome assessment was ensured by a blind review of raw data and by un-blinding only after the database was locked, and by conducting statistical analysis in compliance with the statistical analysis plan. Reporting bias by selective outcome reporting [9] was prevented by the availability of the study protocol and pre-specification of (primary and secondary) outcomes and by adhering to these specifications.The intention-to-treat (ITT) collective was defined to comprise all volunteers randomized and having taken at least one dose of the test products (intervention 1 at V1). The Per-protocol (PP) set comprised all volunteers randomized, who have no major protocol deviation. The analysis included the full analysis set (FAS).The baseline and demographic characteristics of the two groups with different order of intervention (verum-control versus control-verum) were compared using Student's t or Mann–Whitney test as appropriate depending on the distribution of data. The effect of intervention (verum and control) was evaluated by two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures (ANOVA RM), to take cross-over design and potential effects by the order of intervention into account. The intervention was the factor with repetition. The order of treatments was not repeated. Normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and equal variance (Levene) was tested within the two-way ANOVA RM and confirmed for the primary (iAUC120 of glucose) and secondary (iAUC120 of insulin) parameter. The significance level of the primary and secondary parameters was adjusted to multiple testing according to Bonferroni-Holm.",https://t.co/LklnNhaRgg,others
"Abstract KN01: Keynote Lecture: PI 3-kinase links obesity, insulin resistance, and cancer","Abstracts: AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference: Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics; October 26-30, 2017; Philadelphia, PAAbstractPhosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated by insulin and other growth factors to mediate cell growth. The PI3K enzyme encoded by the PIK3CA gene is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer. This same enzyme mediates insulin responses in liver, muscle, fat, and other tissues. The most common mutations in this gene enhance the ability of PI3K to bind to the insulin receptor substrates, IRS1 and IRS2, and thereby enhance the ability of PI3K to be activated by insulin and IGF1. This observation raises the possibility that elevated levels of serum insulin could enhance the growth of tumors that express the insulin receptor, especially when the tumor expresses a mutant form of PIK3CA. Consistent with this idea, retrospective studies have shown that cancers that correlate with obesity and insulin resistance (conditions where serum insulin levels are high), such as endometrial, breast, and colorectal cancers, frequently have activating mutations in PIK3CA. These observations suggest a model in which tumors with mutations in PIK3CA are highly sensitized to insulin-dependent growth and that the elevated serum insulin levels in individuals with insulin resistance in liver, muscle, and fat promote anabolic metabolism in the tumor. This condition would allow the tumor to take up glucose more readily than muscle or fat in insulin-resistant individuals. We have generated mouse models to interrogate the role of PI3Ks in metabolic control and in the generation of cancers. These studies indicate that inhibitors of PI3Ks could be effective in treating cancers in specific mutational backgrounds. More than 20 PI3K inhibitors that target the gene product of PIK3CA have entered clinical trials for treating solid cancers. Although these inhibitors look promising, a variety of toxicities have created challenges. Some of the toxicities, such as hyperglycemia, are on target since inhibition of the PIK3CA gene product is expected to cause insulin resistance. Importantly, the acute insulin resistance that occurs in response to PI3K inhibitors not only raises serum glucose levels, but also induces insulin release from the pancreas, which raises insulin levels. As discussed above, the increased serum insulin has the potential to activate PI3K in the tumor, and it is possible that very high insulin levels could reactivate PI3K in the tumor despite the presence of a PI3K inhibitor. We have interrogated this possibility in a wide variety of mouse models of cancer and find that the high serum insulin levels that appear following an oral dose of a variety of PI3K inhibitors in both human and mouse are sufficient to activate the PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway. We have utilized multiple therapeutic interventions in attempts to prevent this rebound of insulin-dependent PI3K reactivation in tumors, including metformin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitor, and a ketogenic diet. We found that the ketogenic diet is more effective than other therapies at lowering serum insulin levels during PI3K treatment. Importantly, combining a ketogenic diet with a PI3K inhibitor causes a dramatic shrinkage of tumors compared to either therapy alone.Citation Format: Lewis C. Cantley.

"Visiting Mexico, asking strangers: Diabetics scramble for costly insulin","Mike Lawson will never forget how he ended up in the hospital 12 years ago when he had to decide between making a $300 car payment or buying insulin. ""I made a stupid choice,"" said Lawson, an Oakland resident who has Type 1 diabetes. ""That month I chose to pay for my car payment and to ration insulin."" These days, the price of insulin skyrocketing, and he is stockpiling the drug. Through Twitter, Lawson recently connected with a stranger who said she had four leftover bottles after switching brands. The two exchanged messages and met near her San Francisco office. Letting insulin go to waste ""is almost like tossing gold,"" Lawson said. The price of three commonly used insulin products has increased substantially in recent years. From 2013 to 2019, the cost of NovoLog nearly doubled, going from $289 to $540 per carton, according to according to letters sent in February to drug manufacturers by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating insulin prices. Another common drug, Lantus, rose in price from $244 to $431, the committee said. (The drug's maker, Sanofi, says the numbers rose from $228 to $425 over that time period, but the amount paid to the company actually fell 25% after Sanofi paid rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.) A vial of Humalog, a third popular insulin drug, cost $35 in 2001 and by 2015 had risen to $234, according to the Senate committee. And so, worried about cost, diabetics such as Lawson are increasingly seeking new ways to get, give away or exchange insulin cheaply or for free. Some are using unofficial channels on the internet. Others are traveling to Mexico, where pharmacies sell some popular types of insulin for a fraction of their cost in the United States. Lawson, who now is able to get insulin for a moderate price through insurance even though he still seeks out extra, has also given away some of his insulin to local strangers in need, who find him through Twitter by searching hashtags like #T1D (Type 1 diabetes) and #insulin4all. For the roughly 1.5 million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, the amount of money patients spent on insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $240 to $475 a month, according to a January report from the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care data. And spending in 2017 continued to rise, experts said. ""The risk isn't only that people are being trapped in debt,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, tweeted last weekend. ""Americans have actually died from diabetic ketoacidosis because they had to ration or skip their doses. We need to rein in Big Pharma greed to save lives."" Many stories have emerged nationwide about people who, like Lawson, rationed or delayed buying insulin because they could not afford it, often leading to deadly and dangerous results. About 1 in 4 diabetes patients uses less insulin than prescribed because of costs, according to a 2018 Yale University study. ""It's not just anecdotal, this is relatively widespread,"" said the study co-author Dr. Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. ""There are lots of patients having difficulty affording their insulin."" But why is insulin, which is naturally produced by the pancreas and first discovered for medical use nearly a century ago, so expensive? The scientists who invented it in 1923 sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto for the purpose of making it accessible. But the way the drug is produced and delivered to the body has changed significantly since then. Insulin was initially isolated from animal pancreases, but today it is made by inserting the human insulin gene into bacteria, producing the insulin protein, and then purifying it. Insulin is derived from live organisms and put through a complex process to become a medicine — so it's hard for a competing drug company to make a generic version of it. A handful of drug manufacturers have essentially patented the processes for creating modern-day insulin products just enough to keep exclusive patents under their name, experts said. Only three drug companies sell insulin in the United States: Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk. ""Some of the insulins have dozens of patents on them even though the active ingredient patent has expired,"" said Jeannie Biniek, a health economist who co-wrote the Health Care Cost Institute report. ""There's a question of whether these additional patents are providing a justified return on the investment or, if at some point, they are just providing the company the opportunity to maintain a monopoly on the market."" And, as is the case with many prescription drugs, it's not clear how the ""list price"" of insulin — what a patient would have to pay out of pocket for it, if they do not have insurance — is determined because negotiations between drug companies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers about who pays what are considered proprietary. Drug companies say lowering the list price wouldn't necessarily lead to lower costs for consumers because part of the list price gets paid to pharmacy benefit managers. In recent weeks, amid growing pressure from Congress, the drug companies and some insurers have announced plans to make insulin more affordable. But they fall short of many consumers' expectations. Eli Lilly, which makes Humalog, announced in March it will offer a half-price version of the popular fast-acting insulin for $137 per vial, but has not said when it will be available. A Lilly spokesman said the company also offers a free hotline that consumers can call for information about out-of-pocket reductions at the pharmacy and clinics where donated insulin is available. In April, hours before Sanofi executives were set to testify before a congressional committee on rising insulin prices, the company announced it will sell its insulin products for a fixed price of $99 a month, for up to 10 vials or boxes of insulin pens, to patients paying with cash. Patients who have commercial health insurance are eligible for co-pay cards that may lower their out-of-pocket expenses, a Sanofi spokesman said. Last year, 246,000 people used the co-pay cards and paid nothing or $10 a month for their Sanofi insulin, he said. Sanofi also provides free insulin for low-income uninsured patients who make about $30,000 a year or less. Novo Nordisk has provided free insulin to tens of thousands of uninsured people with diabetes since 2003 and spends $200 million each year on co-pay assistance to patients with commercial health plans. ""We know how challenging it is for a growing number of Americans with diabetes to afford their medicines, including the ones we make,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesman said. ""As a company focused on improving the lives of people with diabetes, this is not acceptable."" Cigna and Express Scripts, which recently merged, announced that they would cap out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $25 a month for patients whose pharmacy plans are managed by Express Scripts. Up to 700,000 people who are on employer-sponsored plans are eligible to receive this benefit if their employer decides to opt in. ""I'm glad to see the mounting pressure and public outcry are having an impact in Lilly releasing this generic and Cigna capping spending, but that's not enough,"" said Lipska, of Yale. ""Those are Band-Aid solutions that don't resolve the underlying issue of very high prices for these insulins."" Indeed, the discount and savings programs aren't reaching everyone. Sabella Larkin of San Diego said she has had to buy insulin in Mexico three times — once in Tijuana and twice in Rosarito. The first time was several years ago, when she was a college student in Texas, while working full time at a tanning salon and struggling to pay her bills. Her insurance at the time wouldn't cover an insulin refill until a certain date, and she couldn't wait. One of her customers at the salon lent her $200 to buy an insulin pen. ""Two weeks later when I got paid, I tried to reimburse her and she said no,"" said Larkin, 28. ""Being in that situation, that's when I went to Mexico and happened to see the insulin I take. It was only $20. I literally cried."" Larkin said she has purchased both NovoLog and Lantus in Mexico for $20 to $25, for the same amount of insulin that would have cost her hundreds of dollars at U.S. pharmacies. ""It was life changing,"" she said. ""It was this added security across the border."" Catherine Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Endothelial Adora2a activation promotes blood-brain barrier breakdown and cognitive impairment in mice with diet-induced insulin resistance,"AbstractObesity and insulin resistance elicit blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in humans and animal models, but the relative contributions of the two pathologies remain poorly understood. These studies initially addressed the temporal progression of cerebrovascular dysfunction relative to dietary obesity or diet-induced insulin resistance in male mice. Obesity increased BBB permeability to the low molecular weight fluorophore sodium fluorescein (NaFl), while diet-induced insulin resistance increased permeability to both NaFl and Evans Blue, which forms a high molecular weight complex with serum albumin. Serial section transmission electron microscopy analysis of hippocampal capillaries revealed that diabetes promotes involution of tight junctions, fenestration of endothelial cells, and pericyte regression. Chronic activation of adenosine receptor 2a (Adora2a) erodes tight junctions between endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature in other models of chronic neuropathology, and we observed that acute Adora2a antagonism normalized BBB permeability in wildtype (Wt) mice with diet-induced insulin resistance. Experiments in mice with inducible deletion of Adora2a in endothelial cells revealed protection against BBB breakdown with diet-induced insulin resistance, despite comparable metabolic dysfunction relative to nontransgenic littermates. Protection against BBB breakdown was associated with decreased vascular inflammation, recovery of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and restoration of hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in vascular endothelial cells disrupts the BBB in dietary obesity, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the underlying mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and insulin resistance.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of circulating factors into the brain, but obesity promotes BBB breakdown in humans and animal models. We used transgenic mice with resistance to BBB breakdown to investigate the role of neurovascular dysfunction in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive impairment. Transgenic mice with inducible ablation of Adora2a in endothelial cells were protected against BBB breakdown on HFD, despite comparable metabolic impairments relative to normal mice. Transgenic mice were also resistant to HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction and were protected against deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in endothelial cells mediates obesity-induced BBB breakdown, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and diabetes.FootnotesThe authors declare no competing financial interests.This work was supported by grants R01DK110586 and K01DK100616 from the NIH to A.M.S.

Insulin Pump Shown Difficult for Many Users,"MiniMed 670G system (Medtronic Inc.)25 Mar. 2019. An assessment of a closed-loop insulin pump system shows a sizeable proportion of first-time users stopped using its automated feature because of problems in making it work. A team from Boston Children's Hospital reported their findings yesterday at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in New Orleans.Researchers led by endocrinologist Gregory Goodwin, also a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, sought real-world evidence on the practical utility of the Medtronic MiniMed 670G, a closed-loop hybrid insulin pump system, sometimes called an artificial pancreas. The Food and Drug Administration in September 2016 cleared the MiniMed 670G for marketing to people age 14 and up — later extended to children as young as 7 — with type 1 diabetes, an inherited autoimmune disorder where the body does not produce insulin, and is diagnosed primarily in children or young adults. About 1.25 million people in the U.S. have type 1 diabetes, about 5 percent of people with diabetes of any kind.The MiniMed 670G is called an artificial pancreas because it can monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin flow with little or no intervention by the wearer. However, people wearing the device still may need to manually increase an insulin dose to account for carbohydrate increases at meal times, and periodically calibrate the sensor. The system monitors glucose levels with the sensor attached to the body, and pumps insulin through an infusion patch and catheter, while an algorithm controls the device, keeping glucose levels in personalized target range.Despite being hailed as a ""groundbreaking"" and ""life-changing"" development, anecdotal evidence persists about the MiniMed 670G's difficulty to use, particularly in auto-mode where the system automatically adjusts insulin flow to correspond to the wearer's glucose levels. Goodwin and colleagues reviewed the experiences of 83 children and young adults, age 6 to 25 — most were teenagers — who tried the MiniMed 670G for the first time, in May to September 2018. All of the participants in the study previously used insulin pumps or were familiar with continuous glucose monitoring, and were trained by company representatives in the system's use.The team reports nearly 1 in 5 participants, 16 individuals or 19 percent, stopped using the MiniMed 670G in auto-mode during this time. The main reasons for discontinuing auto-mode features were technical difficulties with the sensor or keeping the device in auto-mode, with the system forcing exits on occasion. Other reasons cited were calibration requirements, problems with sensor durability or adhesion, and skin irritation. The remaining 67 participants or 81 percent continued to use auto-mode, although the percent of time with this feature ranged from 10 to 90 percent.The researchers followed-up with 58 of the 67 auto-mode users and found they benefited from the MiniMed 670G. Blood glucose levels from the participants' hemoglobin a1c data showed an average decrease of 0.27 percent after 97 days, compared to readings taken in the 6 months before starting on the system, a difference large enough for statistical reliability.""Patients can reap the full benefits of the system in auto-mode,"" says Goodwin in an Endocrine Society statement. ""But this technology is demanding and requires a technically sophisticated patient or parent to use it.""More from Science &amp; Enterprise:* * *Please share Science &amp; Enterprise ...",https://t.co/PJBaNprHPR,others
Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-1 treatment stabilizes the microvascular cytoskeleton under ischemic conditions.,"Our previous studies showed that Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-1 reduced blood brain barrier permeability and decreased infarct volume caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in middle aged female rats. Similarly, cultures of primary brain microvessel endothelial cells from middle-aged female rats and exposed to stroke-like conditions (oxygen glucose deprivation; OGD) confirmed that IGF-1 reduced dye transfer across this cell monolayer. Surprisingly, IGF-1 did not attenuate endothelial cell death caused by OGD. To reconcile these findings, the present study tested the hypothesis that, at the earliest phase of ischemia, IGF-1 promotes barrier function by increasing anchorage and stabilizing cell geometry of surviving endothelial cells. Cultures of human brain microvessel endothelial cells were subject to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence of IGF-1, IGF-1 + JB-1 (IGFR inhibitor) or vehicle. OGD disrupted the cell monolayer and reduced cell-cell interactions, which was preserved in IGF-1-treated cultures and reversed by concurrent treatment with JB-1. IGF-1-mediated preservation of the endothelial monolayer was reversed with LY294002 treatment, but not by Rapamycin, indicating that IGF-1 s actions on cell-cell contacts are likely mediated via the PI3K pathway. In vivo, microvessel morphology was evaluated in middle-aged female rats that were subjected to ischemia by MCAo, and treated ICV with IGFI, IGF-1 + JB-1, or artificial CSF (aCSF; vehicle) after reperfusion. Compared to vehicle controls, IGF-1 treated animals displayed larger microvessel diameters in the peri-infarct area and increased staining density for vinculin, an anchorage protein. Both these measures were reversed by concurrent IGF-1 + JB-1 treatment. Moreover these effects were restricted to 24 h after ischemia-reperfusion and no treatment effects were seen at 5d post stroke. Collectively, these data suggest that in the earliest hours during ischemia, IGF-1 promotes receptor-mediated anchorage of endothelial cells, and its actions may be accurately characterized as vasculoprotective.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Sir Frederick Banting MD,"Determined to investigate his hypothesis, Banting was recommended to Dr. J.J.R. Macleod at The University of Toronto, where he was hesitantly given laboratory space to conduct experiments on the pancreas using dogs. Dr. Charles Best, a medical student at the time, was assigned to assist Banting's research. Within a few months, Banting and Best had successfully isolated a protein hormone secreted by the pancreas, which was named insulin.With assistance from Dr. James Collip, the insulin was successfully refined and produced for clinical trials, which were immediately successful. Demonstrating his altruistic commitment to advance medicine, Banting sold the patent rights for insulin to The University of Toronto for $1, claiming that the discovery belonged to the world, not to him. This allowed insulin to be mass-produced, making it widely available to the public for the treatment of Diabetes. Although not a cure, this breakthrough would save millions of lives and, to this day, provides treatment for a disease that was previously considered a death sentence.Following the highly publicized discovery, fame came quickly to the soft-spoken and modest Banting. He was jointly awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Dr. J.J.R. Macleod for the discovery of insulin. Amid controversy, Banting chose to share his prize with his partner, Dr. Best and Macleod chose to share his prize with Dr. Collip. The youngest recipient of a Nobel Prize, Banting suddenly became a celebrity and was revered as a hero worldwide. In 1934, he was knighted by King George V and was among the last group of Canadians to be honoured with this esteemed title.In response to Banting's popularity and successful research, the Ontario Legislature awarded The University of Toronto an annual grant to establish the ""Banting and Best Research Fund"". With this financial support, the university hired Banting as Canada's first Research Professor and established the Banting and Best Department of Medical Research in 1930, with Banting as the chair of the department and Best as a research associate. Banting remained committed to medical research and scientific discovery and participated in research relating to silicosis, cancer and aviation medicine, among many other projects. Banting was also an avid painter and was close friends with A.Y. Jackson of the Group of Seven, who mentored and encouraged Banting's artistry. Banting's pursuit of painting allowed him refuge from the pressures and fame of his early success and, today, he is regarded as one of Canada's most important amateur artists.Banting was also a decorated soldier and served Canada in both World Wars. During the First World War, he served in the Canadian Army Medical Corps and was awarded the Military Cross in 1919 for his ""distinguished and meritorious services"" during the Battle of Cambrai in 1918. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Banting again volunteered to serve Canada, coordinating the National Wartime Medical Research effort with the National Research Council of Canada, where his team researched treatments for mustard gas, anti-gravity suits and oxygen masks. He served as a liaison officer between British and North American medical services; in this capacity, he was travelling to England in February 1941, when his plane crashed in Newfoundland and his life was tragically cut short.Banting's legacy lives on in the numerous researchers who followed in his footsteps and who made medical breakthroughs at the research institutions bearing his name. His childhood farm in Alliston, now called The Banting Homestead Heritage Park, attracts school and community groups annually. The house in London, Ontario, where he originally conceived the idea that led to the discovery of insulin, is now Banting House National Historic Site of Canada, a museum dedicated to preserving Banting's important legacy. Later coined the ""Birthplace of Insulin,"" the museum has become an unofficial pilgrimage site and attracts visitors from around the world each year who wish to pay tribute to the famous co-discoverer of insulin. ~Author credit: A.

Paleo-Ketogenic Diet Benefits (+ Advanced Tips) • Dr Zsofia Clemens PhD,"Listen to the Podcast Episode on Apple iTunes • Overcast • Spotify • Stitcher App for Android • Google MusicVIDEODr Zsófia Clemens: Neurobiologist and clinical researcherIn today's interview I get to speak with, Dr Zsófia Clemens, a neurobiologist and clinical researcher about how the Paleo-Ketogenic Diet (PKD) can cure multiple health issues by healing, what Zsófia believes to be the underlying cause to all serious health problems, intestinal permeability.Zsófia is very passionate about helping patients heal and find effective cures for their illnesses. She developed the PKD with her clinical team based solely on credible scientific research.In today's interview, we get a chance to talk about how the PKD approach differs from other paleo/low-carb/ketogenic and carnivore diets.While there are similarities between these diets, Zsófia believes the increased therapeutical effectiveness and the absence of negative side-effects (and more serious consequences) are due the some vital differences. No dairy or plant-based oils, such as coconut oil, is a big one. However, there is also the stricter guidelines around the necessary fat content and organ meat that needs to be consumed for optimal health and results.If you know someone who is interested in finding out more about the Paleo-Keto Diet and how it can help them heal a myriad of health issues ranging from various autoimmune diseases like arthritis and Chron's to diabetes, epilepsy and cancer, this interview is for them.I enjoyed this interview with Zsófia and I learned a lot from our conversation. She shared a lot of valuable information and insights into why some people may not be getting the desired results or may be struggling with certain side-effects (such as leg cramps, thyroid issues) even after making the switch to low carb/keto lifestyle. I also learned some great tips on how to remedy these!Special thanks to Zsófia for joining me on the show. Enjoy the episode!Show Notes with Timestamp Linkshttps://omnystudio.com/d/clips/303f3935-d96e-47f7-8f9b-a75a00ba8f31/63993e1e-67bd-4453-bc07-a75a00bb10b8/9cfc0128-96e8-48f9-bdbe-a95400b76f7d/audio.mp3Highlights of what we talk about during the interview:Click on one of the timestamp links in the brackets to jump to that point in the interview audio[00:19] – Introducing, Dr Zsofia Clemens, a neurobiologist and clinical researcher specializing in nutrition, nutritional therapy, and neurology. She is a specialist in the Palaeolithic ketogenic physiology, and the head of the PaleoMedicina research group in Hungary, which has been using the Palaeolithic ketogenic diet exclusively since 2013 to help patients with a variety of conditions.[01:30] – What is a Palaeolithic-Ketogenic diet (a.k.a PKD)? In short, it is an animal meat-based diet that requires eating animal fat and organ meats. Zsofia explains how they use the meat-based approach in combination with the ketogenic diet to treat many severe diseases.[03:31] – PKD sounds a lot like a keto-carnivore diet. The difference is, however, that the PKD has clear guidelines with regards to dairy products, a clearly defined protein to fat ratio as well as advice on including organ meats as an important part of the diet; all of this is unclear with the carnivore diet.[05:36] – The PKD excludes some components that are included in the classical ketogenic diet. Number one is the dairy and there is a lot of research and reasoning why it should be excluded. Dairy is especially harmful if you are suffering from autoimmune disease or cancer as it is linked to boosting tumour genesis and causing type one diabetes; in fact, type one diabetes could result from a ketogenic diet that includes a lot of dairy![08:16] – The problem is not due to lactose, but the milk protein. Zsofia explains this is because milk promotes tissue growth so that the small animal grows, and that dairy shouldn't be consumed past the age of three.[09:26] – Zsofia has seen this connection between dairy and disease both in patients and in clinical research studies. For males, it commonly manifests as prostate cancer and for women, breast cancer.[10:27] – Dairy is not a good option even for people who are just looking to get their fat content up; the fat should come from animal meat instead of dairy products. Zsofia explains some side-effects she sees with many patients on the classical ketogenic diet include magnesium deficiency, iron deficiency, anaemia, as well as more serious side-effects and pneumonia because of less than optimal diets.[12:59] – The risks are the same for both the classical 80/20 ketogenic diet and the modified ketogenic or Atkins diets because the diet components are the same e.g. heavy cream, coconut oil etc. Dr Eric Kossoff has shown this with his epilepsy clinic studies which looked at the efficacy vs side-effects of these types of diets.[15:05] – Zsofia talks about the efficacy of the classical ketogenic diet being much lower than most people think; only one child in 10 becomes seizure free, and 50% have half the amount of seizures. While this is a significant improvement, the PKD almost always results in seizures stopping completely.[17:12] – Children who are put on the classical ketogenic diet for the short-term are taken off it when they are ready. PKD should be sustained for their entire life because there are no negative effects like you get with the classical ketogenic approach. e.g. bone quality decrease in growing children (so they are usually smaller than the average) because of the unhealthy composition of the diet, not ketosis itself. (Listen to our interview with Emma Williams From Matthews Friends for more on the Ketogenic diet and seizure control).[18:58] – Zsofia also believes medium chain triglyceride oils, or MCT oils, are detrimental because they are plant oils and cause gastrointestinal issues. Examples include: GI pain, diarrhoea, constipation and increased inflammation.[19:48] – People are increasingly adopting a ketogenic way of living just for the ketosis component and using MCT in their drinks or on food could also be causing issues over the long term. Zsofia explains coconut oil (or any type of vegetable oil) start to develop decreased thyroid function and increased fatigue.[22:50] – As well as decreasing thyroid function, Zsofia explains that these oils cause autoimmune issues which in turn attack the thyroid gland and cause problems. She believes that the root of all autoimmune disease is the increase in membrane permeability and there is no way to reverse this other than adopting the PKD.[25:11] – In Zsofia's clinic they measure intestinal permeability with PEG 400 testing when possible. She explains it can be a relatively expensive test, but is a relatively simple process to perform clinically. You start by ingesting a solution then your urine sample gets tested for specific markers that shouldn't normally be in the urine and indicate a leaky gut.[28:35] – Zonulin is another marker for intestinal permeability, but it is not a direct measurement since it is measured in the blood. It indicates membrane permeability in general, not just in the intestines. This is important as there are other membrane barriers that can get leaky with time incl. the mouth, nose, or the most important one, the blood-brain barrier.[30:01] – Even our blood-brain barrier could become affected by what we're eating. This then contributes to brain fog, as well as potentially more serious conditions. Zsofia explains that first, the intestinal permeability develops and over time other members become compromised giving rise to autoimmune diseases.[36:16] – PKD is adapted from the Paleo diet, but to ensure the gut lining is healthy and there is no autoimmune reaction attacking multiple systems in your body, it goes a step further. No gluten, nuts and other plant-based foods are allowed.[32:24] – Colostrum, which is derived from dairy, is used as a treatment for irritable gut and helps with gut issues for certain individuals. Zsofia explains why she doesn't believe colostrum is a good solution; studies she has seen use methodology she disagrees with, affecting the reliability of the results and she's never seen colostrum reverse any serious disease.[34:29] – Previous guests on the show, including, Mikhaila Peterson, Amber O'Hearn, Kelly Hogan, and Dr. Shaun Baker had great success on carnivore diets. Mikhaila especially has an autoimmune condition which improved drastically. Zsofia has seen this happen many times; reversing intestinal permeability is the basis for these results.[35:41] – If symptoms resolve on a PKD diet can certain foods ever be re-introduced? Zsofia advises against this because these barriers are highly dynamic and eating certain foods will affect the lining leading to symptoms returning. There are certain foods that should never be consumed; these include dairy, cereals, and vegetable oils. Allowances can be made by increasing vegetable or fruit intake and drinking a limited amount of coffee.[37:10] – What's in coffee that Zsofia feels is detrimental? She explains coffee is a plant and all plants are full of bioactive substances. One of these groups is the polyphenol group.[38:29] – We know that a Western diet, high in carbohydrates, results in high production of free radicles in the mitochondria. A diet high in antioxidants (which counteract oxidative stress) such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and polyphenols is considered beneficial. Zsofia explains, however, that the polyphenols are ""double-faced"" molecules, and act as pro-oxidants in some conditions and antioxidants in others.[40:39] – Zsofia explains how they have never seen a patient develop vitamin C deficiency on PKD. She explains this is only a concern if blood glucose level is high, due to a phenomenon called glucose ascorbate antagonism; the availability of vitamin C is much lower in high carb contexts. Her tip is that Vitamin C needs to come from organ meats because there is not much of it in other meat.[43:32] – While there is a risk of nutritional deficiency on a carnivore diet where no organ meat is included, Zsofia does not exclude the possibility that healthy people could be fine without it. But those patients who are recovering from illness will need more nutrients to regenerate tissue.[44:34] – The organ meat with the highest concentrations of minerals and vitamins is the liver and the brain; the brain can contain 100 times the vitamins found in the blood of the animal! Bone broth is also good initially to help with the leaky gut, but it is not sustainable to only eat broth. As a base for good long- and short-term health, Zsofia recommends eating fatty meat and organ meats.[47:07] – Carnivores usually underestimate the amount of fat they should be eating. We need to replace the energy from carbohydrates with enough fat to avoid energy problems. The ratio should be 2 fat to 1 protein.[48:18]- Some good examples of fat sources include tallow, streaky bacon, bone marrow and fat drippings as well as good quality sausage or smoked slab.[51:18] – One pitfall with an all meat diet is that people could be eating too much protein and not enough fat. The average person shouldn't need more than 400 grams a day provided they keep to the correct ratios; if you are doing a lot of exercise, this needs to be increased accordingly. Zsofia always encourages patients to ensure they are adding enough (animal) fat to their meal.[54:27] – Is salt an important component to longevity on this diet too? Zsofia explains that more salt is needed when eating a carbohydrate-based diet because of the sodium-dependent glucose channel. Decreasing the carbohydrates in your diet and in your blood means less salt is needed. Any additional salt, however, is excreted by your kidney without a problem.[56:16] – Zsofia also explains that unlike the loss of minerals that occurs during the adaptation process when switching to a classical keto diet, on PKD we get all the minerals we need in a more bioavailable form, e.g. if you had magnesium deficiency before, your magnesium levels will be normalised.[56:48] – There are other transitory side-effects that occur when we switch the metabolism from carbs to fat; common ones are low energy, headaches and diarrhoea.[57:40] – Tips for someone who is dealing with these symptoms is to be aware it's only a transitionary phenomenon. If diarrhoea persists, however, it is indicative that too much meat (in relation to fat) is being consumed. We discuss an interesting study of how PKD helped heal Crohn's and stopped the need for meds; Zsofia cautions that patients on meds should be carefully managed by a qualified physician.[1:00:50] – Some people complain meat gives them irritable bowel syndrome. While there are rare exceptions of people reacting more to red meat, the question in these cases needs to be, what kind of meat is it? Small nuances are important, substances such as additives or supplements, even in very small amounts, can derail progress made.[1:03:51] – A common concern for many people is the question of fibre and normal bowel movements? You will have bowel movements much less frequently (in some cases only once in 10 days) but this does not mean you are constipated nor is it less healthy. The amount will also be smaller, but this is normal. Also, it is good to note that dairy can give you real constipation.[1:06:26] – What about the debate that meat contributes to bowel cancer? Any links are not due to less frequent bowel movement but the additives and the consumption of processed meats with nitrites/nitrates.[1:08:49] – Measuring blood glucose and ketones provide very useful feedback. Patients take measurements at home or while at the retreat get their blood glucose and ketones measured along with weight and blood pressure. It is all part of the learning process and good a way of making sure patients stick to the diet and stay in ketosis.[1:10:15] – One of the problems with the carnivore diet is that if someone's not eating enough fat they won't be in ketosis. Zsofia explains that there is an optimal range of ketosis that should be reached, and it should be as consistent as possible every day to achieve the best therapeutical benefits and avoiding symptoms returning.[1:13:19] – One side effect of the ketogenic diet is cramping. Zsofia explains this is due to the magnesium deficiency, which can be temporary. Her clinic published a study where they've have shown patients who have been following the PKD all had normal magnesium levels and no cramps. To solve this problem, stop eating fructose and eat meat and fat.[1:16:44]- For people on low carbohydrate diet/ketogenic diets who are getting leg cramps it could indicate they are not getting enough magnesium. Combination of not eating enough organ meat and doing a lot of heavy exercise will deplete stores. Her tip is to help deal with muscle cramps; increase your intake of liver.[1:17:58] – Zsofia explains how in young, newly diagnosed patients with type one diabetes, there is a narrow window (within six weeks of diagnosis) where the condition can be managed by strict adherence to the PKD, without injecting insulin. This is because their pancreas is still producing a small amount of insulin. Zsofia urges people not to try this on their own without consulting a medical professional.[1:23:32] – Long-time type one diabetics normally don't see spikes in glucose after fatty meals and are usually very stable; if this is not the case it can indicate problems and improper diet adherence or incorrect fat/protein ratio.[1:24:33] – It is not overly surprising that this diet approach is suitable for type two diabetics to help the body heal because the blood glucose levels can be controlled with the classical ketogenic diet, the Palaeolithic diet or any low carb diet. Zsofia explains the PKD offers additional benefits in terms of inflammation and it is crucial if you want to prevent further complications of diabetes.[1:26:14] – There are at least three inflammatory markers measured in patients; the C reactive protein (CRP), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fibrinogen. Normally when someone adopts this way of eating, those markers normalize too. If not, there is usually a problem with the diet.[1:27:24] – A patient comes to the clinics once a week, every month and their treatment focuses primarily on food; the fat, the protein and the organ meat. There's no other supplements or medicines prescribed. In addition, at the clinic, they aim to educate the patient about dietary aspects, facilitate groups of patients so they can share experience, manage data on medications, and give advice for those medicines that cannot be stopped within a short period of time. They also set up a plan on how to control the disease for the long-term.[1:30:23] – Zsofia explains that they never impose fasting on patients and argue against this practice in individuals with disease because they need to be nourished. Usually, this means two meals a day, which is a normal frequency of the meals due to higher satiety.[1:32:10] – The clinic in Hungary is, for ethical reasons, only for patients who have a pre-existing condition. If someone wanted to learn more about adopting this way of eating, they are providing individual consultations on the internet.[1:33:52] – For those wanting to find out more on related topics, read articles and more details about consultations visit the Paleomedicina clinic's websiteThanks for Listening!Now it's time to share your thoughts.You can: Share this episode on Twitter, Facebook, or Pinterest.

Milton Alvis's answer to What is insulin resistance?,"Insulin resistance, crucial to lifelong health, means cells which used to respond to insulin and Amylin (especially liver and muscle cells) no longer respond as well.A huge range of variance in response exists, very high responsiveness is optimally healthy; reduced responsiveness is always characteristic of advanced disease.Why would this happen?Answer: The cells would become sick and die if they responded to insulin as well as previously; when healthier.What does insulin do?Answer: It is one of two small protein signaling proteins (the other is amylin) produced by the Beta cells of the Islets of Langerhans within the pancreas, always released in a fixed ratio, under both local and especially brain control (many specifics still poorly understood), that induce responses in other cells to lower glucose concentrations [optimal average of 100 mg/dL (HbA1C=5.0%, or lower) from human observational studies without treatments, despite many medical disease industry references which indicate higher is OK] in body water.Do either insulin or amylin directly reduce glucose concentrations?They are only endocrine hormones which (like all endocrine hormones) which may alter the activity of other cells.What is the response of cells which express insulin receptors on their outer cell membrane?Answer: These receptors relay the momentary insulin binding from their external receptor to internal cell signaling pathways which MAY result in internal membranes containing glucose transporter proteins being moved and fused into the outer cell membrane elsewhere (from the insulin receptor) on the surface of the cell. The glucose transporter proteins allow glucose to move from the water outside the cell into the water inside the cell. Without glucose transporter proteins within the outer cell membrane, glucose and other charged molecules will NOT pass through the two layers of fat molecules (phopholipid and cholesterol) of which all animal cells are primarily constructed, called a lipid bilayer, i.e. all cell are microscopic fat organized water droplets and all life on the planet is based on fat organized water droplets.Why would a cell which, when very healthy, expresses insulin receptors on its outer fat membrane no longer either express as many insulin receptors or insulin receptor binding no longer result on glucose transporter proteins being moved into the outer lipid bilayer?Answer: Because it is already overloaded with glucose: more than it needs, can burn or store as glycogen.What would induce cells to become insulin resistant?Answer: The unhealthy sugar overload inducing Low Fat Diet, as promoted by Ancel Keys and George McGovern, versus Nutritional Ketosis, long verified to be vastly healthier for humans, a fundamental adaptation which allowed humans to develop a larger, more energy intensive, critical for survival organ, the human brain.What is the most effective fuel for brain cells? Answer: Sugar or Fat? Definitely Fat! Yet the brain has little access to fat if the body owner keeps choosing low fat foods.Do these same issues apply to a huge number of other common human disease which have greatly increased over the last half century on the Western diet? Answer: Absolutely!Then why has the US Gov, USDA, NIH, AHA, ADA, Big Food and the medical disease industry long promoted, indeed still largely do? Answer: (You can likely figure this one out for yourself with some accuracy.)I would suggest study some of the work of Stephen Phinney, an MD and PhD, a researcher who has long studied these issues, along with a huge number or other online resources such as DietDoctor, Low Carb Down Under, etc.I hope this helped.",https://t.co/I6qATf06G1,others
Anabolic Mineral Support for Elite-Level Athletes and Lifters,"Anabolic Mineral SupportIf you train hard, you're likely deficient in five key minerals:MagnesiumZincSeleniumChromiumVanadiumAthletes and lifters lose these minerals through sweat and exercise, especially intense weight training. In fact, one intense workout can deplete magnesium levels for up to 18 days. Similar effects can occur with zinc and other crucial minerals.These minerals support a host of important biological functions, including a few that all hard-training athletes and bodybuilders should be concerned about:Optimal testosterone productionProtein synthesis (a series of chemical reactions that form the basis of muscle building)The regulation of blood sugar levels and insulin What Happens If I'm Deficient?In short, a deficiency in these five minerals can lead to suboptimal testosterone levels, disappointing results in training, fatigue, and difficulty losing body fat or staying lean.*ElitePro Mineral Support contains the highest quality, most easily absorbed forms of these minerals, ensuring that your body has what it needs for high-level performance.*What Makes ElitePro Minerals Elite?NFL players are required to supplement with vitamins and minerals. Tim Ziegenfuss, a PhD in Exercise Science and Sports Nutrition, works with a lot of these players, providing them with dietary protocols. But a few years ago he had a problem. He knew that average store-bought mineral supplements weren't designed for the elite athlete's needs, and he knew that most of these formulations just didn't work well. Dr. Ziegenfuss asked Biotest to come up with a designer formulation using only the highest quality minerals that the body can actually absorb and put to work. Biotest utilized the ultimate mineral research group and manufacturer, Albion Labs, to make the world's best mineral supplement. Albion's patented technology produces totally reacted amino-acid chelates. This means that each mineral atom is double-bonded to an amino-acid molecule, thereby making an amino-acid chelate that's not only small enough to pass through the intestine, but small enough to be transported right into the cell itself.*Mineral formulations that aren't chelated are problematical. At worst, they're not absorbed. At best, they're absorbed nominally because the majority of the foods we eat have chemicals in them that inhibit their absorption. But because of the chelation process, it doesn't matter if you take ElitePro Minerals with food or without food. However, we recommend taking the formulation at night because magnesium has a mild sleep-inducing effect.Further, to guarantee quality, the amino acid chelates used in ElitePro Minerals have been tested by the following methods:*X-Ray DiffractionElectron Paramagnetic Resonance SpectrometryInfrared SpectrometryFourier-Transformed Infrared SpectrometryThe Ultimate GuaranteeThe ElitePro formula ensures that hardcore athletes have energy systems, protein synthesis, hormone production, bone density, and insulin and blood-sugar management required for elite-level performance. You can know for certain that all your mineral-supported biological functions are optimized and running at full speed.*",https://t.co/qCth4idVeT,others
Can You Recognize Insulin Resistance in Children?,"The International Pediatric Association biennial meeting has long focused on the terrifying list of threats to child health: poverty, malnutrition, vaccine-preventable disease, toxic stress. But this year's meeting, held in Panama City, Panama, March 17-21, added a new agenda item: the paradoxical twin burden of undernutrition and obesity. A range of experts described the rising incidence of obesity, particularly as more countries have turned away, for myriad reasons, from locally sourced traditional foods to mass-produced, cheap, nutritionally poor yet calorically dense foods to feed their populations. This rise in overweight and obesity is underpinning a rise in insulin resistance. While historically a problem that does not manifest until adulthood, insulin resistance—and the resultant cascade effects of hyperglycemia, prediabetes, and, if unchecked, diabetes—heralds a lifetime of health risks for the affected child. Diva De León-Crutchlow, MD Diva De León-Crutchlow, MD, chief of the division of endocrinology and diabetes, and director of the Congenital Hyperinsulinism Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, presented the latest research on this topic at the conference and joined Medscape after her talk to summarize key messages. What is the incidence of insulin resistance in both the United States and internationally? While obesity is well recognized as a risk factor, what other factors increase risk? Can you ""tell by looking"" which children may have insulin resistance? We don't have a specific test to measure insulin resistance, so it's difficult to pin down hard-and-fast incidence numbers. But the studies that have followed obese or overweight children longitudinally indicate that a large percentage of those children will develop insulin resistance, particularly those with unfavorable fat distribution. The reality is that if you start with fat distribution in subcutaneous tissue, it is going to move to other tissues that impact insulin sensitivity, such as the liver. Normally this is a problem that occurs in adults, but increasingly it also occurs in children, and that is very highly associated with obesity. A rise in obesity is accompanied by a parallel rise in insulin resistance. One study[1] that followed healthy 6-year-olds found a prevalence in insulin resistance of over 25% in the children who were overweight or obese. However, I'm hesitant to cite some of those studies because there is not agreement on which measures should be used to assess insulin resistance in children. There are several specific risk factors that clinicians may not recognize. Infants born small for gestational age, especially those who then gain weight very rapidly early in childhood, are at particular risk, even if they are not obese during adolescence and later. Another group at risk are girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome and menstrual irregularities. The general practitioner, while addressing the menstrual irregularity, may not put that into the context of the whole metabolic profile. These girls often have insulin resistance and are at risk for type 2 diabetes. There is a genetic component that increases insulin resistance independent of weight. I don't think we completely understand what these genetic predispositions are, but it is important to ask about the frequency of type 2 diabetes in the child's family. The child of a mother with gestational diabetes is at higher risk for obesity and insulin resistance. You mentioned that there is not agreement on measures to assess insulin resistance. How can clinicians best identify these children? Rapid weight gain during the first year of life has been shown to be particularly important in predicting later adiposity, which correlates with insulin resistance. We're all so frustrated with the difficulty in successfully addressing overweight and obesity—particularly for children living in poverty, with more limited food options and environments that may not support vigorous outdoor play. Your practice is in an urban environment. Could you talk about some practical strategies that you have used? We tell parents to provide a high-fiber, low-sugar diet, but many people really don't know what that means. So in our one-to-one or group educational sessions, which are conducted by a nutritionist, we explain the different food groups and how to implement them in the diet. We teach people how to cook foods that are healthy and edible, too. Not all clinicians may have the ability to refer their kids to these kinds of educational interventions. In terms of physical activity, you're absolutely right that there are so many factors that are outside the control of the families and the medical community that affect a child's opportunity for physical activity. Schools are key. There are a lot of things that can be done inside the school that can be impactful, from the foods served to the opportunity to play. I frequently ask children if they like to dance. Most people like to dance, and that may be a perfect way of exercising inside the house or school, as well as doing it with friends. Are diet and exercise enough? Should pharmacotherapy be part of the strategy? If so, for which kids? The reality is that even in adult populations, there's no good evidence that metformin is indicated just for insulin resistance. I think that the approach to pharmacotherapy may change in the future as we realize that the results of nonpharmacologic interventions are not enough. But right now, with the evidence we have, there is not, in my opinion, a role for using pharmacotherapy in a child who doesn't have some comorbidity. What about surgery? We've been resistant to thinking about surgical intervention for obesity. But that's changing. We are realizing that surgery for an adolescent that is done by a multidisciplinary team that addresses all of the potential consequences and helps that family to support the needed lifestyle changes is an effective intervention. We're going to need more data outside the context of a research environment before we recommend this intervention for younger children. But for adolescents, it's becoming more and more of an option. Can surgery get teens off the insulin resistance slope? Can a child return to normal insulin sensitivity? The studies that have been done demonstrate that one can. The question is sustainability of the interventions that support a child in staying off that ramp. If the initial interventions that support a healthy lifestyle are sustained, that can permanently get that child off the track to insulin resistance and diabetes. We know that type 2 diabetes is a more severe disease in a young person than in a 60-year-old. Do you think the message that type 2 diabetes is a life-threatening condition in kids is getting out there? I have to say, probably not. I don't think it is recognized that it is a severe disease. There is a whole risk profile that accompanies type 2 diabetes in kids, including a very high risk for cardiovascular disease and complications we're used to seeing in adults that are now seen even at presentation in children. That is out of proportion to adult presentation of type 2 diabetes. I don't know that we understand why that is. Is the lack of recognition that diabetes is present—the long delay until diagnosis—the reason there is so much comorbidity at presentation? Or is the comorbidity a result of the severity of the disease itself? I think it's probably a combination. It is a more severe disease, and not only because it affects individuals for a longer time when it starts early, but because the disease itself is different, even within the same family. The parent may have developed diabetes at age 40 or 50 years of age, but the child develops diabetes at a younger age. It is likely a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors that determines the severity of the condition in children and adolescents. And while we're all learning to screen children earlier, not all kids see a healthcare provider annually. The lack of access to medical care, especially for vulnerable populations, affects how early the condition is recognized in a child and therefore how early intervention is sought. If we're going to effectively prevent this disease cascade, we really have to be looking at the whole cluster of risk factors in the children we are seeing for well-child visits. Thinking about how the child and family are eating, the opportunities for play, the family genetics, are all necessary. Early recognition of this profile and early intervention before the child even becomes overweight and insulin resistant are critical. As of now, we're not doing enough.

Prices of select insulin shoots up to 20% in one yr,"Chennai: Fluctuating US Dollar has pushed prices of insulin pens, cartridges and basal insulin by up to 20% over the last few months, thereby pushing up medical bills of diabetics in India. Diabetologists say, nearly a third of of their insulin dependent patients are now paying more for their daily medication. Data sourced from the online medical store, Netmeds, show that cost of basal insulin — the type of insulin that regulates glucose levels between meals preventing low sugar, and premixed varieties that come in pens and cartridges have gone up anywhere between 3.5% to 20.9% between January and December 2018. For instance, the cost of insulin pens sold by pharma giant Eli Lilli and Company has gone up by Rs 134 in December 2018 from Rs 640 in January. This is a 20.9% increase in a year, while Basalog One 100IU Pen Injection from Biocon went up by Rs 79 or nearly 10% higher increase to the current price of Rs 823.1. The cost of basal insulin by Sanofi went up by Rs 277 to Rs 2,983 in 2018 per vial.Companies said the fluctuation in US Dollar prices over the last few months has pushed up costs and hence a price increase. ""For the products made in India, prices have been stable. Some products, like pens, cartridges and basal insulin are imported. Cost for most such products has gone up. Commonly used insulin that can be drawn into syringes from vials haven't gone up,"" said pharma analyst R Srinivasan. However strict vigilance by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, has helped maintain pointless price rise, he added. The International Diabetes Federation data shows that the prevalence of diabetes among people between 20 – 79 years of age in India is 72.9 million. In Chennai more than a fifth of its population are diabetics.Although less than a quarter of the patients across the country take insulin, at least 30% of those are prescribed basal insulin. Nearly a third of diabetics in India are prescribed basal insulin. ""These insulins are given to patients when there is a need. We also see if they can afford them,"" said award winning senior diabetologist Dr V Mohan. The cost of managing diabetes is mostly out of pocket as most health insurers don't pay for outpatient therapy and drugs. The average monthly expense for a diabetic comes to be anywhere between Rs 3,000 to Rs 8,000 per month. In case of hospitalisation, it can cost anywhere between Rs 40,000 to Rs 1.5lakh for medical management including intensive care. For instance, 46-year-old chartered accountant Srinivasan R was advised a switch over — from human insulin on vials to basal insulin two years ago, after he complained about palpitation and dizziness at work. ""Tests show that my sugar levels were dropping down to dangerously low levels at certain times when the insulin is at its peak. My sugar levels were also fluctuating through the day The basal insulin acts uniformly through day and I found the change comfortable,"" he said. But Srinivasan, who was paying around was paying around Rs 2,700 for this insulin till mid-2018, has to pay at least Rs 2,980 now. ""This would mean at least Rs 5,000 more for me every year. Medical insurance doesn't fund it,"" he said.",https://t.co/JCtiIF6D9K,others
Schizophrenia Risk and Insulin Resistance Intrinsically Linked,"New research provides more evidence of genetic ties between schizophrenia and insulin resistance and suggests that patients with insulin-resistant schizophrenia may constitute a distinct subgroup with diminished response to antipsychotics medications. ""Because these patients show diminished response to antipsychotic medication, they might require personalized treatment tailored to their endophenotype,"" lead researchers Sabine Bahn, MD, PhD, and Jakub Tomasik, PhD, from University of Cambridge, UK, told Medscape Medical News. The study was published online April 3 in JAMA Psychiatry. Shared Genetic Factors? Patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of impaired glucose metabolism, yet the comorbidity between the two conditions cannot be fully explained by known risk factors such as obesity, smoking, stress, or antipsychotic medication. Previous family and genome-wide studies have suggested that the co-occurrence between schizophrenia and impaired glucose metabolism may be due to shared genetic factors, as illustrated by increased risk of diabetes in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia, but the biological mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. Bahn and colleagues studied the association between insulin resistance, schizophrenia polygenic risk, and response to treatment in 58 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 58 matched healthy individuals while controlling for a range of demographic (age, gender, body mass index), lifestyle (smoking, alcohol and cannabis use) and clinical (psychopathology scores, treatment drug) factors. They found that insulin resistance significantly correlated with schizophrenia polygenic risk score in patients, with higher genetic risk of schizophrenia associated with increased insulin resistance. They also found that patients with higher insulin resistance were more likely to switch antipsychotic medication during the first year of treatment (adjusted odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 - 3.52; P = .02), which implies lower clinical response. ""Future large-scale pharmacogenomic studies in drug-naive patients with longitudinal clinical follow-up will help to further examine the association between insulin resistance, schizophrenia, and antipsychotic treatment response, in addition to determining the effects of other lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise, identifying specific genetic variants underlying shared susceptibility to schizophrenia and insulin resistance, and potentially guiding the development of novel, personalized treatment approaches,"" the investigators said. Alternative Explanations? Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Toby Pillinger, MRCP, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, UK, noted that the study's outcomes are ""consistent with a theory that was first proposed over 100 years ago — that risk of developing both schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes are intrinsically linked."" There are, however, other potential explanations for the outcomes, he noted. ""For example, the influence of diet and exercise was not assessed. Increased genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with worse symptoms and functioning, so you might expect patients with higher polygenic risk scores to have worse diet and reduced exercise levels, which would increase insulin resistance,"" he said. Similarly, the observation of increased insulin resistance predicting nonresponse to treatment may simply be explained, Pillinger said, by patients with more severe symptoms at baseline (which will respond less well to treatment) having poorer lifestyle factors that increase insulin resistance. ""In other words, these outcomes may not actually be directly (intrinsically) related,"" Pillinger said. ""So, while the findings are novel and interesting, future studies need to consider the influence of confounders such as lifestyle before we can make definitive statements regarding intrinsic links and causality."" The study was supported by grants from the Stanley Medical Research Institute. Tomasik was a consultant for Psynova Neurotech Ltd, until April 2016.

Track 30: Food SustainableFood is essential to life. It also forms an important part of our cultural identity, and plays an important role in the economy. Many of today´s food production systems compromise the capacity of Earth to produce food in the future. Globally, and in many regions including Europe, food production is exceeding environmental limits or is close to doing so. Nitrogen synthesis exceeds the planetary boundary by factor of four and phosphorus use has reached the planetary boundary. Land use change and land degradation, and the dependence on fossil energy contribute about one- fourth of Greenhouse Gas emissions. Agriculture, including fisheries, is the single largest driver of biodiversity loss. Regionally, water extracted by irrigation exceeds the replenishment of the resource.Price volatility, access restrictions and the interconnectedness of global commodity markets, as well as the increasing vulnerability of food production systems to climate change and loss of agro-biodiversity, will make food even more inaccessible for the poor in the future.What drives our food system?Global trends in population and affluenceFood prices / volatility / availabilityChanges in dietFood wasteChanges in the supply chainFisheriesWaterPhosphorusBiodiversity lossHow can we move towards a more resource efficient and sustainable food system?Better technical knowledge on the environmental impacts of foodStimulating sustainable food productionPromoting sustainable food consumptionReducing food waste and lossesImproving food policy coherenceRecommended Conferences: Food and Beverage Conferences | Food Conferences | Food Technology Conferences | Food Agro Processing ConferencesRelated Conferences:23rd Edition of International Conference on Food Nutrition &amp; Beverages, September 25-26, 2019, Copenhagen, Denmark; The Food Defence Conference, May 22-24, 2018, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Nano-Enabled Technologies to Improve Efficiency, Quality, and Health in Food and Agriculture Conference, June 02 - 03, 2018, South Hadley, US, North American Food Safety &amp; Quality Conference 2018,June 05-06, 2018, Chicago, IL, International Food Blogger Conference, August 24-26,2018, New Orleans, Louisiana, 21st European Food &amp; Nutrition Conferences, June 11-12, 2018, Dublin, Ireland; 10th Euro-Global Aquaculture Conferences, October 08-09, 2018, London, UK.2nd International Food Science and Bioprocess Technology Conference, October 01-03, 2018, Frankfurt, Germany.14th International Nutrition Conferences, July 19-20, 2018, London, UK; 14th International Childhood Obesity Conferences, February 18-19, 2019, Rome, Italy. 9th European Food Safety Conferences, November, 29-30, 2018 Dublin, Ireland.15th International Food &amp; Nutrition Conferences, May 24-26, 2018, Vienna, Austria.21st International Food Technology Conferences, October 02-04, 2018, London, UK.3rd International Food Packaging Conferences, July 16-18, 2018, Rome, Italy; 6th International Nutrition Conferences, August 16-18, 2018, Dublin, Ireland; 8th International Food Safety Conferences, June 11-12, 2018 Barcelona, Spain; 3rd International Food Security and Sustainability Conference, May 21-22, 2018, New York, USA.22nd Euro-Global Food Conferences, February 28- March 02, 2019 London, UK.21st International Food Summit, October 11-13, 2018, Moscow, Russia.Related Societies:Europe: Food Additives and Ingredients Association, Chilled Food Association, European Dairy Association, European Federation of Food Science and Technology.USA: U S Food and Drug Administration, International Association for Food Protection, Centre for Food Safety | Protecting Our Food, Farms &amp; Environment, International Dairy Foods Association.Asia: Centre for Food Safety, Federation of Asian Nutrition Societies, Asian Food Safety and Security Association, Thai Food Processors' Association.",https://t.co/kyjZJhx9VG,others
CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway activates brown adipocytes and induces insulin resistance in CXCR4-deficient mice under high-fat diet,"Ethics statementAll experimental procedures were performed in accordance with specified guidelines and regulations for the care and use of laboratory animals. All animal procedures were approved by the Chiba University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Establishment of immortalised brown adipocytesThe BAT derived from C57BL/6 mice was finely chopped in balanced salt solution of Hanks with collagenase (C2139; Sigma) and bovine serum albumin (A9647; Sigma). Tissue samples were incubated with hot water at 37 °C for 30 min under constant shaking. The cell suspension was filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)- high glucose (D5796; Sigma) and immortalised by infection with SV40 lentivirus (Applied Biological Materials Inc.). Introduction of SV40 lentivirus into cells was confirmed from the expression of SV40 lentiviral gene with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. These cells were called as CB-1 cells.Differentiation of brown adipocytesConfluent CB-1 cells were exposed to a differentiation medium. Differentiation medium is DMEM-high glucose containing 20 nM insulin (I6634; Sigma) and 1 nM T3 (T2877; Sigma). On the second day, the medium was changed to induction media, which comprised the differentiation medium plus 0.125 mM indomethacin (I7378; Sigma), 2 μg/mL of dexamethasone (D4902; Sigma), and 0.25 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (I7018; Sigma). On the third day, the medium was changed to differentiation medium. The differentiation medium was exchanged every 2 to 3 days after the fourth day. The state of CB-1 cells was observed, and the experiment was conducted in CB-1 cells with many lipid droplets in the cytoplasm after about 15 days from differentiation induction.Activation of brown adipocytes by CXCL12Mature CB-1 cells were treated with 20 or 100 nM of recombinant CXCL12 (Murine SDF-1α: CXCL12 #250-20A; PEPROTECH) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. About 1 mM of CL316,243 (C5976; Sigma) as a selective β3AD-R agonist was added to mature CB-1 cells for the positive control of brown adipocyte activation.Evaluation of mRNA expression levelWe extracted mRNA using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). After treatment, CB-1 cells were washed thrice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by RLT buffer. The cell lysate was collected from the bottom of the culture dish using a scraper and transferred into the column of RNeasy kit. RNA was eluted using 20 μL of RNase-free water. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from the eluted RNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). Expression of mRNA in the cells was examined by qRT-PCR (ABI7900; Applied Biosystems) with the cyber green method of the primer set (Supplementary Table S1). Level of mRNA were normalised to 36B4 gene.Detection of protein expression by western blottingProteins were extracted using the radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing Complete (04693116001; Roche) as a protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell lysate was transferred into microtubes and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. After collection of the supernatant, protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce® BSA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were mixed with 6 μL of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer and the volume was adjusted to 20 μL using RIPA buffer. The samples were heated at 98 °C for 4 min and applied into the wells of 10% polyacrylamide gel® (ATTO) with electrophoresis apparatus. About 5 μL of Precision Plus Protein Standards (#161-0374; BIO-RAD) as protein markers were applied to a specific well of the polyacrylamide gel. The samples in the well were run at 0.04 A for 80 min. The separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Sequi-Blot PVDF Membrane; BIO-RAD) at 20 V for 90 min. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% of Tween-20 (TBS-T) in 5% skim milk. After washing thrice with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaker with anti-UCP-1 antibody (ab10983; Abcam) as the primary antibody. The membrane was washed with TBS-T and treated with an anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked Whole Antibody (NA934; GE Healthcare) in TBS-T as the secondary antibody for 1 h on a shaker at room temperature. Anti-β-actin antibody (A1978; SIGMA-ALDRICH) was used as an internal control. After washing thrice with TBS-T, the membrane was treated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) mix (RPN2209; Amersham) for 5 min. The protein bands were exposed to an X-ray film in the dark and quantified using densitometry with ImageJ software (National Institute of Health).Measurement of oxygen consumptionDifferentiated CB-1 cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in a non-CO2 incubator. OCR and ECAR in each well were evaluated with XF 96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience Inc.). Twelve measurements were approximately taken after every 7 min. CXCL12 and CL316,243 were added to each well via an injection device after the third measurement. The final concentrations of CXCL12 and CL316,243 were adjusted to 100 μM and 1 mM, respectively, in each well.Signal pathway experimentDifferentiated CB-1 cells were preincubated with P38, ERK, and PKA signal inhibitor at 37 °C for 30 min and treated with 100 nM of CXCL12 for 2 h. SB203580 (#5633; Cell Signalling Technology) as a P38 inhibitor, FR180204 (#0320; Sigma-Aldrich) as an ERK inhibitor, and H89 (#9844; Cell Signalling Technology) as a PKA inhibitor were adjusted to a final concentration of 10, 25, and 10 μM, respectively. At the end of the reaction, cell lysate was harvested using RLT buffer and RNeasy Mini kit. Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and examined with qRT-PCR to detect UCP-1 mRNA expression.Phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated ERKCXCL 12 was added to CB-1 cells, and proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer after 15 minutes and 30 minutes. After western blotting, total p38(9212 S; Cell Signaling), phosphorylated p38(9211 S; Cell Signaling), total ERK (9102 S; Cell Signaling), and phosphorylated ERK (9106 S; Cell Signaling) were reacted as primary antibodies. After reacting with ECL using HRP secondary antibody, it was exposed to x-ray film, and the band was finally quantified.Mice with cold circumstances or HFD feedingC57/B6 mice were placed at 4 °C as a cold environment for 4 h, and their BATs were excised after stimulation. C57/B6 mice as the control mice were left at 28 °C (room temperature) for 4 h. The expression of mRNA in the BAT was evaluated using qRT-PCR. An obesity model mouse induced with HFD was prepared. Four-week-old C57/B6 mice were fed with 60 kcal% of fat as a part of HFD (D12492; RESEARCH DIET INC.) for 4 weeks. Mice fed with 5 kcal% of fat as a normal fat diet (ND) (CE-2; CREA Japan Inc.) were regarded as a control group.Extraction of mRNA from tissuesThe BAT was homogenised with 1 mL of TRIZOL reagent (15596018; Invitrogen) for ~30 mg of BAT. After homogenisation, the insoluble fraction was removed with centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant sample was treated with 0.2 mL of chloroform at room temperature for 5 min. The tube was vortexed for 15 s and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 0.5 mL of isopropyl alcohol. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellet was washed once with 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 75,00 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was dried and 30 μL of RNase-free water was added to the pellet. The pellet was mixed by pipetting and incubated at 60 °C for 10 min. cDNA was prepared using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (205311; QIAGEN) from the obtained RNA, and mRNA expression was examined with qRT-PCR.Generation of knockout miceCXCR4flox mice were purchased from RIKEN BioResource Center (Ibaraki, Japan). UCP-1 Cre mice were provided by Charles River Labs Japan Inc. CXCR4flox/flox mice were crossed with UCP-1 Cre mice to obtain F 2 generation of brown fat-specific CXCR4-deficient mice. Primary brown adipocytes derived from the BAT of these mice were cultured and the expression of mRNA was confirmed with qRT-PCR. BAT, WAT, and liver were excised from these mice, and the gene expression level was tested in each tissue. CXCR4flox/− mice sibling was regarded as control mice.Exposure to HFD or normal chow dietHFD containing 60 kcal% of fat was administered to male knockout mice and control mice until 32 weeks. Body weight and occasional blood glucose level were weekly measured. Food intake were estimated every five weeks.Evaluation of glucose metabolismIntra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was carried out after 5 weeks of HFD or normal chow diet feeding. Mice were fasted for 15 h, and the glucose amount for injection was set at 2 g/kg. ITT was carried out to evaluate insulin sensitivity at 7 weeks after HFD or normal chow diet feeding. Mice were fed ad libidum and the amount of insulin was set at 0.6 units/kg. IPGTT was administered by the same protocol at 26 weeks after HFD or normal chow diet feeding. Insulin amount was set to 1.0 units/kg in ITT at 26 weeks. Blood was collected from the vein of the tail at fasting and 30 min after glucose loading. Serum insulin level was measured with Morinaga Ultra Sensitive Mouse/Rat Insulin ELISA Kit (M1104; Morinaga).Evaluation of CXCL12, and CXCR4 protein level in BATProteins were extracted using RIPA buffer in the liver of wild type and the knockout mice. After western blotting, anti-CXCL12 (ab18919; abcam) antibody and anti-CXCR4 (ab124824; abcam) antibody were reacted as primary antibodies. After reacting with ECL using HRP secondary antibody, it was exposed to x-ray film, and the band was finally quantified.Measurement of serum CXCL12 concentrationThe concentration of serum CXCL12 was measured at 5 and 26 weeks after feeding with HFD using R&amp;D Systems Quantikine ELISA Mouse CXCL12/SDF-1α (#MCX120; R&amp;D Systems).Single injection of CXCL12 in BAT of wild type miceWild type mice were injected phosphate buffered saline, CXCL12, or CL316, 243 as control, CXCL12, or positive control, respectively. Injection dose of CXCL12, and CL316,243 were 10 μg and 0.1μg base on 1 g body weight, respectively. Each BAT was excised 4 hours after injection and RNA was extracted. UCP-1 mRNA levels as an activation marker for BAT were quantified by qRT-PCR.Quantification of Phosphorylated Akt in the Liver of Mice with High Fat DietProteins were extracted from the liver by RIPA buffer. After electrophoresis of proteins, western blot is performed, and phosphorylated Akt antibody (2965 S; Cell Signaling) and total Akt (4691 S; Cell Signaling) antibody are reacted as a primary antibody, and ECL is added after reaction with a secondary antibody with HRP. It was taken in as an image after exposure to X-ray film.RNA-seq in BAT of the wild type and the knockout mice with the high-fat chowA series of RNA-seq libraries was prepared in Kazusa DNA Research Institute.We compared wild type and knockout mice with the R (Bio Conductor software package; version 3.4.1) and listed about 120 genes with P &lt; 0.01. The biological process, KEGG pathway was obtained by analysing these genes into the String-database (https://string-db.org/). Furthermore, I made a figure of 12 genes included in the Positive regulation of lipid metabolism, which comes to the top by Biological process.",https://t.co/OY8UxSN5iA,others

Dr. Fung discusses calories and how its not about the calories, it's about the hormones, specifically insulin. Insulin makes you fat. Diets that lower calories fail repeatedly. The cause of obesity is too much insulin. Lowering your carbs and intermittent fasting. We don't need to eat 10 times a day and snack all day. This raises insulin over and over and insulin is a fat storage hormone and makes us fat.Dr. Berg also talks about the kidney and insulin, about insulin resistance, about the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 52 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.

Mobile-based insulin dose adjustment for type 2 diabetes in community and rural populations: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Insulin initiation and/or titration for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is often delayed as it is a resource-intensive process, often requiring frequent exchange of information between a patient and their diabetes healthcare professional, such as a credentialed diabetes educator (CDE) for insulin dose adjustment (IDA). Existing models of IDA are unlikely to meet the increasing service demand unless efficiencies are increased. Mobile health (mHealth), a subset of Ehealth, has been shown to improve glycaemic control through enhanced self-management and feedback leading to improved patient satisfaction and could simultaneously reduce costs. Considering the potential benefits of mHealth, we have developed an innovative mHealth-based care model to support patients and clinicians in diabetes specialist community outreach and telehealth clinics, that is, REthinking Model of Outpatient Diabetes care utilizing EheaLth - Insulin Dose Adjustment (REMODEL-IDA). This model primarily aims to improve the glycaemic management of patients with T2DM on insulin, with the secondary aims of improving healthcare service delivery efficiency and the patients' experience.METHODS/DESIGN: A two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted for 3 months with 44 participants, randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either the mHealth-based model of care (intervention) or routine care (control), in diabetes specialist community outreach and telehealth clinics. The intervention arm will exchange information related to blood glucose levels via the Mobile Diabetes Management System developed for outpatients with T2DM. They will receive advice on insulin titration from the CDE via the mobile-app and receive automated text-message prompts for better self-management based on their blood glucose levels and frequency of blood glucose testing. The routine care arm will be followed up via telephone calls by the CDE as per usual practice. The primary outcome is change in glycated haemoglobin, a marker of glycaemic management, at 3 months. Patient and healthcare provider satisfaction, and time required to perform IDA by healthcare providers in both arms will be collected. This pilot study will guide the conduct of a large-scale pragmatic RCT in regional Australia.",https://t.co/bhlAFFXUDh,others
"Live slow, die old: Mounting evidence for caloric restriction in humans","Let's say you wanted to hear a first-hand story of ordinary life 100 years ago. Where might you go to find a storyteller? Maybe you want to hear as many stories as possible. Where might you go then?Undoubtedly you would choose the subtropical Japanese island of Okinawa, where you would find centenarians at three times the rate of already long-lived mainland Japan. Once their own state, Okinawa is a proud maritime culture home to the endangered Uchinaaguchi dialect, a sizeable and little-loved American military presence going back to World War II, and the largest natural experiment in human longevity on record. Some elderly Okinawans might attribute their longevity to habushu, a traditional rice liqueur with a pit viper coiled at the bottom of the bottle. In fact, the habu snake does possess the curious property of being able to survive long spans of time, up to a year, without food, and perhaps this is where Okinawans take their dietary cues from. In 1972, the Japan National Nutrition Survey found that they consumed 17% less energy than the Japanese average, much of it from plant-based material like the Japanese sweet potato, their staple food, in contrast with the rice-heavy cuisine of the mainland. Partly as a result of this diet, Okinawans died of heart disease, cancer, and cerebral vascular disease at rates 60-70% of the Japanese average, and lived on average a year and a half longer.Okinawans were far from the first to benefit from such a lifestyle, though. Anecdata on the benefits to lifespan and health of restricting caloric intake stretch back to Luigi Cornaro's 16th century Discorsi della vita sobria. This four-part guide to living long and well detailed his own regimen of 350g of food per day, plus 400mL of wine, a habit which he claimed to be responsible for his 102 years of life. But prior to the scientific era, all sorts of odd practices were sworn by as preventative treatments for aging, and there was little to distinguish Cornaro's account from the dubious claims that abounded on the topic.Animal models offer support for longevityThen in the 1930s, researchers at Cornell's Animal Nutrition Laboratory were able to increase rat lifespans up to 50% by restricting their caloric intake, and in the following decades it became clear that this method could also be used in flies, worms, dogs, and other short-lived animals. Data on long-lived animals was sparse, though, and there was disagreement as to whether the pathways on which caloric restriction worked were conserved across all species. Primate studies were especially important: since clinical trials in humans would be nearly impossible to conduct due to the length of our lives and the infeasibility of enforcing dietary constraints over that span, these results would likely either serve as confirmation or be the death knell for caloric restriction in humans. So the scientific community went from excitement in 2009, when the University of Wisconsin published positive results for CR's longevity benefits in rhesus monkeys, to confusion in 2012 when the NIA published their own findings contradicting these results. As is often the case, the devil was in the details–methodology varied substantially between the two studies, from the ages of the monkeys used, to the types of food in their diets, to the amount of food the control animals ate. NIA monkeys were fed a diet rich in whole foods, while UW monkeys' diets contained more refined sugar and fat, and the gap in caloric intake between the NIA's test and control groups was noticeably smaller than UW's–meaning that all of the NIA monkeys ate a somewhat restricted diet.Even more telling was the age difference in test groups. The NIA began their trial with juvenile and elderly monkeys, while the UW monkeys were all adults. Previous studies in animals had indicated that the later the intervention occurred, the less improvement was seen, and the best results were achieved in rodents if CR began immediately after weaning, so it was unsurprising that the NIA's elderly group failed to demonstrate substantial benefit. Unlike rats and mice, however, youth didn't predict better treatment results. In fact, young CR monkeys in the NIA study died at a slightly higher rate than controls. Considering humans' closer relationship to primate development than to rodents, this likely indicates that we too would be better served by only beginning CR in adulthood. In all, the UW study that had originally reported positively on CR in adult monkeys seemed to have the advantage. The research community was tentatively optimistic once again, but for clinicians, evidence from animal models alone would never be enough to wholeheartedly recommend an intervention.Biomarkers present a shortcutBy the early 2000s, a wide array of data on caloric restriction in humans was available, much of it from observational studies of self-selected individuals who practiced CR as a lifestyle. There was also growing interest in the possibility of using biomarker predictors of aging diseases and longevity, particularly in overweight populations. Early biomarker studies of CR in humans were almost universally small and short, but in 2015, Duke's CALERIE trial results reported on a large, 2-year randomized control study tracking measures associated with diseases of aging and longevity. Focusing on metabolic activity and inflammation, measures of both categories were improved, including a reduction in C-reactive protein (associated with inflammation), glucose control and blood pressure. However, not all markers showed clear and consistent response to CR treatment.The apparently incomplete response may have been due to the study's failure to meet its goal of reducing caloric intake to 25% below the amount subjects would normally have eaten, averaging only 12% reduction over 2 years. This was despite participants receiving help from a ""very intensive behavioral intervention"" over the duration of the study, highlighting one of the most daunting challenges of translating CR from laboratory models to humans: compliance.Convenient possibilitiesIt would seem that few are eager to sacrifice a quarter of their diet, even for the promise of longer life. Dr. Roy Walford and Brian M. Delaney cofounded the Caloric Restriction Society in 1994 to advocate the practice for humans, and have collected roughly 7,000 members to date that are committed to maintaining 20-30% calorie reduction over their entire lives. Before his death in 2004, Walford wrote numerous books and articles, made television appearances and even a risky gambit during his tenure as a crewmember of Biosphere 2 to persuade the rest of the crew to adopt a meager near-starvation diet, proving himself a dedicated champion of CR. But despite the campaigning of its devotees, dietary restriction for longevity has scarcely built momentum in the general public.Instead, many scientists have turned their attentions toward CR mimetics–small molecule drugs that target similar pathways to those affected by CR. These agents would ideally provide the benefits of CR without the side effects sometimes present in long-term practitioners, such as loss of libido and persistent hunger. Numerous candidates acting on metabolic mechanisms have been proposed, including the antioxidant resveratrol, famously present in wine, but few have lived up to the hype surrounding CR mimetics. One of the more promising medications is metformin, a diabetes drug currently in clinical trials for preventing multiple diseases of aging.How could a diabetes drug prevent cancer?Long-term caloric restriction appears to lead to a variety of metabolic changes, making the exact source of the benefits difficult to tease apart. However, insulin signaling surely plays an important role, both directly in the case of an age-linked metabolic disease like type II diabetes, and indirectly by affecting the risk of developing diseases like cancer. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, and decreases activity of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), a protein that promotes growth and leads to tumor formation. Scientists think that IGF-1 was useful in our ancestral environment, when food was harder to come by and people endured periods of famine interspersed with times of relative plenty, but now that our cells don't need to rush to grow and divide while energy conditions are favorable, high IGF-1 activity likely does more harm than good. Faced with the modern metabolic curse of overabundant food, one growing contingent may be having their cake and eating it too: intermittent fasters are becoming more prevalent among the health-conscious, many finding the regimen easier to adhere to than stringent limits on their overall intake. Intermittent fasting may involve reducing caloric intake, but more often simply compacts an individual's normal intake into feast periods that are bracketed by fasting, varying between 24 hour fasts once per week, to daily 16 hour fast periods. This could simulate an energy balance that is more similar to ancestral conditions, and seems to improve insulin function and glucose regulation. Though it may not produce the full spectrum of beneficial effects that proponents of true CR lay claim to, its combination of health benefits and relative convenience could make it a formidable contender as the next widely-adopted longevity practice.

Leave Dairy for the Cows,"If you chance to drive down some rural road you may see cows roaming and grazing. It looks quite pastoral and serene and you start to feel calm and then you see a calf or two, how sweet, the calf is drinking some milk. The calves don't need to graze on the tough grasses; they have the perfect food available.If milk is perfect for a calf, or a kid if one is inclined to drinking goats' milk, what makes us think that milk is a perfect food for us? For the most part, we turn to dairy in the hope that it will protect our bones and our strength. Milk and other dairy foods are sources of calcium and protein as well as the nutrients magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamins A, B12, D, and riboflavin. Cultured dairy products, yogurt and kefir for example, contain probiotics that can enhance the good bacteria in the digestive systems which kills Candida yeast and promotes digestion. Dairy Is Not as Protective As We ThinkMilk consumption has never been shown to reduce the occurrence of bone fractures. The Nurse's Health Study showed that dairy intake could increase the risk of fractures by 50 percent! As well, it appears to be vitamin D, and not calcium, supplementation that is more important in preventing bone fractures.Dairy plays a negative role in cancer development. Consumption of dairy products increases the levels of cancer promoter insulin-like growth factor-1 in the body. Dairy products and calcium supplementation may increase the risk of prostate cancer by up to 50 percent. On the other hand, calcium supplements, but not dairy products, may reduce the risk of colon cancer.The Nurse's Health Study determined that up to 75 percent of the world's population could be lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance is the inability to properly digest milk and dairy products; as we grow into late childhood and then adulthood we lose our ability to metabolize lactose, the sugar in milk. Some people have a severe intolerance and feel intense gastrointestinal distress while most may feel bloating, headaches, weight gain, and general malaise – symptoms easy to attribute to other causes. It is interesting to note that countries with low dairy and calcium consumption, such as those in Africa and Asia, also have low incidence of osteoporosis. Dairy is high in saturated fat and increases prevalence of heart disease and aggravates irritable bowel syndrome. Where Else Can We Get Calcium and Other Nutrients?Dark, leafy green vegetables should be called 'power houses'. They contain lots of calcium as other nutrients including folate, iron, and vitamins A, C, and K. Other good sources of calcium are tahini, sardines, and bone-in salmon.Strong bones require regular weight-bearing exercise that applies stress to your bones. What is the best thing you can do for your bones? Slip on your shoes and go for a brisk walk! If you prefer a gym environment try pilates, resistance weight-training, and yoga. Other ideas include dancing, hiking, golfing, jogging, tai-chi, and tennis.As stated earlier, current research suggests that vitamin D is more crucial to building strong bones than is calcium. If you don't live in a sunny clime, talk to your doctor about supplementing with 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily. Daily Scenarios Where Dairy Intake Can Be Reduced– Like a little coffee with your milk? Take your coffee black instead of your usual caffè latte or whipped concoction and start savouring the taste. Or, if you're not a coffee lover and drink it purely for the jolt, try it with unsweetened almond or rice milk instead. – Unsweetened almond or rice milk can also be used on your morning cereal in place of milk or yoghurt. Or, toss your cereal with berries or other fruit and start a new breakfast trend. If you have already begun to cut out processed foods and want to stop eating cereal for breakfast, try beans on toast for a filling breakfast, or steel-cut oats cooked in unsweetened almond, rice milk, or water with cinnamon. – As a cheese lover, I struggle to find a good alternative! There are plenty of non-dairy cheeses on the market; give them a try, and you may find one that suits your taste – however, please check the ingredient list as they can be full of preservatives and processed ingredients that do you no favours. If you are feeling brave, you can try making your own non-dairy cheese. Start 'Googling', find a recipe you like, and let me know about it! Milk and dairy foods are not formulated for adult consumption. Start reducing your intake today and feel the benefits! Work toward eliminating it completely. Your heart will thank you.

Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels,"Maintaining healthy blood sugar levelsSugar-laden diets, low physical activity and stress which are so prevalent in today's busy lifestyles, can contribute to a condition known as IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) – a condition which is often experienced prior to the onset of diabetes.1 When we experience glucose intolerance, it means that our body has reduced sensitivity to insulin and increased levels of glucose can then occur in the blood. This can have a negative effect our weight management efforts, not to mention overall health (kidney, cardiovascular and nerve damage, vision impairment).1More specifically, stress and poor diet can cause our bodies to become depleted of the important trace mineral chromium. When our chromium level is low, the body releases the hormone cortisol. Cortisol works contrary to insulin, which manages blood sugar levels, by increasing cellular resistance of insulin and also stimulates appetite and binge-eating. By supplementing with the mineral chromium, we can help the body metabolize carbohydrates and fats while providing it with support for healthy glucose metabolism.2 Healthy glucose management results in glucose being turned into cellular energy.There are several forms of chromium available for supplementation. In recent years, many companies have promoted chromium picolinate as the best source of chromium. Studies on chromium absorption, however, have shown that the bisglycinate form of chromium, a chromium niacin amino acid chelate (branded as Chromium Chelavite®), is actually better absorbed than the picolinate form. Chromium picolinate showed an absorption rate of only 37.5% compared to chromium bisglycinate at 57.5%.3 Chromium bisglycinate supplementation has been shown to reduce levels of cortisol by 19-27% in studies, increasing insulin sensitivity.3An extract of a plant-based ingredient that we are all familiar with on a daily basis, cinnamon, also has potential for helping to support healthy glucose metabolism. Several studies done on humans have shown that cinnamon is able to reduce glucose blood levels and increase insulin sensitivity, as well as lower LDL cholesterol levels.4References:1.

Update on the effects of physical activity on insulin sensitivity in humans,"Stuart et al15Eleven participants with MetS and seven non-diabetic, sedentary controls.Exercise intervention. Preintervention versus postintervention comparison.Eight weeks of increasing intensity stationary cycle training.Cycle training without weight loss did not change IR in MetS subjects or sedentary controls. Muscle insulin receptor expression increased in both MetS and sedentary groups, while GLUT4 expression also increased in the MetS subjects. The excess phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser337 in MetS muscle tended to increase further after training in spite of a decrease in total IRS-1.In the absence of weight loss, the cycle training of MetS subjects increased the expression of insulin receptors and GLUT4 in muscle but did not decrease the IR.Malin et al18Twenty-four older, obese adults with IFG and/or IGT.Exercise intervention.Twelve weeks of exercise (60 min/day, 5 days/week at ∼85% HRmax).Exercise increased clamp-derived peripheral and hepatic SI more in adults with IFG or IGT alone than with IFG + IGT.Exercise increased peripheral but not hepatic SI.Reichkendler et al19Sixty-one, healthy, sedentary, moderately overweight young men.Randomised, controlled trial.Moderate (300 kcal/day) or high (600 kcal/day) physical exercise for 11 weeks, versus sedentary living (control). Pretraining and post-training, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was assessed in five individual femoral muscle groups and four different adipose tissue regions.Aerobic exercise training increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle but not in adipose tissue.Aerobic exercise training enhances glucose uptake in muscle but not adipose tissues, indicating a differential effect on these tissues.Prior et al32Sixteen sedentary overweight, obese, older men and women, with IGTPreintervention versus postintervention comparison.Six months of aerobic exercise and weight loss. Three sessions a week progressing from 20 min at 50% HRR to 45 min at 85% of HRR.Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp and OGTT. Capillary density was measured via biopsies of the vastus lateralis.Insulin sensitivity increased and 120 min postprandial glucose was lower postintervention. These changes were associated with increases in capillary density.Malin et al34Thirty-five older obese adults with prediabetes.Exercise intervention.Progressive 12-week exercise intervention (60 min at~85% HRmax 5 days/week).Exercise increased first-phase and second-phase DI; β cell function = glucose-stimulated insulin secretion × clamp-derived SI).Exercise training plus weight loss increased pancreatic β cell function in a linear dose-response manner in adults with prediabetes. Relatively high exercise doses (&gt;2000 kcal/week) may be necessary to enhance β cell function in adults with poor insulin secretion capacity.Madsen et al36Ten, non-active patients with T2D(56±2 years) and 13 matched healthy participants.Preintervention versus postintervention comparison.Three sessions per week of HIIT (10 × 60 s) for 8 weeks for both patients with T2D and healthy participants. Glycaemic control was assessed using HOMA-IR and β cell function assessed.Patients with T2D displayed significant improvements in HOMA-IR and β cell function. The healthy group, who displayed superior HOMA-IR and β cell function results at baseline, exhibited no change in these measures, which was not unexpected given their baseline values.HIIT was effective in improving HOMA-IR and β cell function in patients with T2D.Brennan et al35Seventy-seven sedentary, obese men and women.Repeated measures, intervention versus control condition.Three to four months of aerobic exercise versus controlHyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp and VO2 peak.Changes to insulin sensitivity were not associated with changes to VO2 peak.de Sousa et al96Forty-four patients with T2D, aged 48–68 years (27 women, 17 men).Randomised trial: diet versus football training plus diet.Football training: 3 × 40 min/week for 12 weeks.Football training plus diet group displayed improvements in HOMA-IR, whereas diet alone did not.Football training plus diet was potentially better at preventing T2D complications than diet alone. It was also more effective than diet alone at improving other markers of metabolic and cardiovascular health, such as blood lipid profile and CRF.Motahari-Tabari, et al52Fifty-three women with T2D.Randomised clinical trial: exercise versus control.Thirty minutes at a maximum intensity of 60% increase in heart rate, three times a week for 8 weeks.HOMA-IR improved and fasting plasma glucose and insulin were lowered.Exercise was effective at improving SI.Ryan et al53Seventy-seven overweight and obese, sedentary, postmenopausal women.Prospective controlled study.Six months of: 'aerobic exercise (3 days/week) + weight loss' versus 'weight loss without exercise'.IR decreased in both groups. Glucose utilisation increased by 10% with 'aerobic exercise + weight loss' and 8% with 'weight loss without exercise'.No statistically significant difference in changes to IR between 'aerobic exercise + weight loss' versus 'weight loss without exercise'. However, exercise benefited other markers of metabolic health.Mitranun et al54Forty-three participants with T2D.Randomised controlled trial.Sedentary (control) versus continuous exercise versus INT. For 30 min/day and 40 min/day, three times/week for 12 weeks.Fasting blood glucose levels decreased in both exercise groups. Glycosylated haemoglobin levels decreased only in the interval trainingINT group.Both continuous training and INT were effective in improving glycaemic control, but the INT programme appears to confer greater improvements.Skleryk et al55Sixteen sedentary, obese men.Exercise intervention.Two weeks of reduced-volume SIT (three sessions of 8–12 × 10 s sprints/week) compared with TER (5 × 30 min sessions at 65% peak oxygen consumption/week).HOMA-IR, AS160 phosphorylation and COX II, COX IV, GLUT-4, Nur77 and SIRT1 protein expression assessed at baseline and approximately 72 hours after the final training bout were unaltered in either group.Two weeks of reduced-volume SIT or TER did not elicit any measurable metabolic adaptations in previously sedentary, obese men.Trachta et al56Fifteen obese women.Intervention with comparison group comprising 'healthy' lean subjects who did not undertake the exercise intervention.Three-month exercise programme consisting of 30 min of aerobic exercise, three times a week.HOMA-IR improved in the obese group.Three months of regular exercise improved blood glucose and HOMA-IR, but had no significant effect on lipid profile and blood pressure.Many et al57Eleven morbidly obese minority adolescents (BMI 41.4±1.8 kg/m2)Exercise intervention.Eight weeks of aerobic exercise training (~180 min/week at 40–55% VO2 peak). Preintervention and postintervention, SI and inflammatory markers were assessed.Insulin action improved in response to training, as indicated by a ~37% increase in SI.This study supports the efficacy of exercise training interventions on improving MetSfeatures in morbidly obese minority youth.Racil et al58Thirty-four obese adolescent girls.Randomised controlled trial.Twelve- weeks of MIIT or HIIT exercise.Significant decrease in IR (HOMA-IR) occurred in both HIIT and MIIT groups (−29.2±5.3 and −18.4±8.6%, respectively.INT improved SI. High intensity interval exercise produced greater benefits than moderate intensity interval exercise.Kurose, et al59Forty three obese patients.Exercise intervention.Thirty minutes on a cycle ergometer or treadmill, three times per week for 6 months, with training intensity adjusted to anaerobic threshold.HOMA-IR improved.Aerobic exercise improved SI. Additionally, IR was the only independent factor influencing improvement in endothelial function.Reichkendler et al60Sixty-one healthy sedentary moderately overweight young men.Randomised controlled trial.Eleven weeks of PA at moderate dose (300 kcal/day), high dose (600 kcal/day) or sedentary living.In both exercise groups, peripheral SI improved. HOMO-IR decreased.Physical activity improved SI and small additional health benefits were found when exercising at ∼3800 kcal/week versus ∼2000 kcal/week in young moderately overweight men.Di Raimondo et al61One hundred and seventy-six subjects with MetS.Exercise intervention.Walking for 1 hour, 5 days a week for 24 weeks at an intensity higher than the one classified as 'comfortable' by the patient.Mean fasting glucose improved.Regular walking at a moderate to hard intensity improved glycaemic control.Lee et al62Forty-four obese adolescent girls.Randomised controlled trial.Three months of 180 min/week aerobic exercise versus resistance exercise versus a non-exercising control group. SI was evaluated by a 3-hour hyperinsulinamic (80 mU·m2/min) euglycaemic clamp.Compared with control, aerobic exercise improved SI but resistance exercise did not.In obese, adolescent girls, aerobic exercise but not resistance exercise was effective in improving SI and did so independently of weight loss or calorie restriction.Bacchi et al63Thirty-one sedentary adults with T2D, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Randomised controlled trial.Effects of 4 months of aerobic or resistance training on SI.Post-training, SI was increased and hepatic fat content reduced in both groups.Resistance training and AER were both effective in improving SI and reducing hepatic fat content in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Motahari-Tabari et al64Fifty-three women with T2D.Exercise intervention versus non-exercise control condition.Eight weeks of walking for 30 min three times a week.Exercise improved HOMA-IR, fasting plasma insulin and glucose.The exercise intervention was effective in lowering plasma glucose, insulin levels and IR.Herzig et al65One hundred and thirteen men and women with prediabetes.Exercise intervention versus non-exercise control condition.Three sessions of 60 min walking per week, for 3 months versus non-exercise control.The exercise intervention improved HOMA-IR, fasting insulin and glucose.Compared with controls, the exercise group improved HOMA-IR and fasting insulin, but did not improve VO2 max or fasting glucose.Damirchi, et al66Twenty-one middle-aged men with MetS.Exercise intervention versus control condition.Six weeks of aerobic exercise: three sessions per week, for 25–40 min of walking or running at 50–60% VO2 peak. Followed by 6 weeks of detraining.HOMA-IR improved after 6 weeks of training, but had returned to baseline after 6 weeks of detraining.Regular exercise improved insulin sensitivity, but needs to be maintained as SI is lost if regular exercise ceases.Solomon et al67One hundred and five participants, with IGT or T2D.Observational clinical study.Twelve to 16 weeks of aerobic exercise training.Glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting glucose and 2-hour OGTT were improved postintervention in 69%, 62% and 68% of subjects, respectively, while SI improved in 90% of the participants.Training-induced changes in glycaemic control were related to changes in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but not SI. Training-induced changes in β cell function may be a key determinant of training-induced improvements in glycaemic control.Grieco et al68Forty-five healthy recreationally active young adults.Randomised controlled trial.Six-week exercise intervention. Four groups: moderate intensity (50% HRR), vigorous intensity (75% HRR), maximal intensity intervals (95/50% HRR) and non-exercising control group.There were no significant changes in insulin effectiveness (HOMA and QUICKI in any exercise group.The exercise intervention did not significantly affect insulin effectiveness in a young adult population as assessed by HOMA or QUICKI.Chen et al69Twenty-three men and women with MetS and 87 men and women without MetS; mean age 48 and 49 years, respectively.Pre-exercise versus postexercise intervention comparison.Three months home-based exercise programme of three x 30-min sessions per week at a moderate intensity of either 'stepper' or 'cardio-dance'.HOMA-IR was maintained in the non-MetS group (1.8 vs 1.9), but deteriorated in the MetS group (3.6 vs 4.3).The authors reported that 72% of the non-MetS group but only 39% of the MetS group achieved the minimum exercise compliance, and suggested that this may have affected the poor outcome in the MetS group.Duvivier et al74Eighteen healthy subjects.Cross-over design to compare daily regimens of activity and exercise.Four days of each of the following regimens: (1) 14 hours/day sitting, (2) 13 hours/day sitting +1 hour/day vigorous exercise, (3) 8 hours/day sitting +4 hours/day walking +2 hours/day standing.OGTTs were undertaken the morning after 4 days on each regimen. AUC for insulin was lower following the walking and standing regimen compared with the others.Reducing sitting time by walking and standing was more effective than 1 hour of vigorous exercise in maintaining SI.Earnest et al75Men at risk for IR.Randomised, controlled, exercise intervention trial.Three months of eucaloric (12 kcal/kg/week) steady state AER compared with INT.Twenty-four-hour and 72-hour postexercise fasting OGTT improved. HOMA-IR was improved with INT and AER. Stratification of participants based on pretraining values for HOMA-IR revealed that both low and high HOMA-IR participants demonstrated significant reductions with INT, whereas only high HOMA-IR showed significant improvements with AER.Eucaloric AER and INT appear to affect fasting glucose OGTT similarly. Both INT and AER benefited those with high HOMA-IR, while INT also benefited those with low HOMA-IR, thereby suggesting that INT may have a greater impact by benefiting across a wider spectrum of HOMA-IR.Gillen et al76Twenty-five sedentary men (27±8 years).Randomised control trial.For 12 weeks, three sessions per week of either: (1) SIT (3 × 20 s maximal sprint, interspersed with 2 min cycling recovery at 50 W), (2) 45 min of moderate intensity cycling at ~75% HRmax (~110W) or (3) non-exercise control. SI was assessed via intravenous glucose tolerance tests.Both exercise regimens produced significant and similar improvements in SI as measured via intravenous glucose tolerance tests performed before and 72 hours postexercise. Likewise VO2 peak improved (~19%) in both exercise groups, as did skeletal muscle mitochondrial content. There were no statistically significant changes in the control group.SIT produced similar fitness and SI improvements to prolonged moderate intensity exercise, despite requiring a fivefold lower exercise volume and time commitment.Shepherd et al77Ninety previously inactive volunteers.Randomised control trial.Ten weeks, three sessions per week of either: (1) HIIT (15–60 s with target HR &gt;90% HRmax, with 45–120 s active recovery for a total of 18–25 min, including warm-up) or (2) 30–45 min continuous exercise at an intensity ~70% HRmax.HOMA improved in both groups, but was achieved with less time commitment and greater adherence in the HIIT group.HIIT may provide a time-efficient alternative to continuous moderate intensity exercise.Arad et al80Twenty-eight overweight/obese African American women.Randomised control trial, with diet determined to maintain body weight. Exercise intervention n=14; control n=14.For 14-weeks, three sessions per week of HIIT (4 × 30–60s at 75–90% HRR with 180–210s at 50% HRR between high intensity bouts) or non-exercise control. SI was assessed using 3-hour euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp.While some parameters of exercise metabolism improved, there were no improvements in SI compared with the control group.HIIT did not improve SI when weight was maintained.Lanzi et al81Nineteen obese men.Randomised control trial.Two-week exercise intervention, four sessions per week of either: (1) HIIT (10 × 60 s at 90% HRmax, with 60s recovery) or (2) 40–50 min continuous exercise at an intensity identified as that eliciting Fatmax.Aerobic fitness improved in both groups, but HOMA2-IR only improved in the Fatmax group.In the short term (2 weeks) exercise training of a continuous moderate intensity (Fatmax) was more effective than HIIT at improving glycaemic control.Fisher et al82Twenty-eight sedentary overweight/obese men (20±1.5 years).Randomised control trial.Six weeks, five sessions per week of either: (1) HIIT (20 minutes comprising repeated bouts of 30 s at 85% of peak Wingate power with 4 min recovery at 15% of peak Wingate power) or (2) 45–60 min continuous exercise at an intensity of 55–65% VO2 max.Postintervention, both exercise groups displayed improvements in SI but neither exercise group displayed statistically significant improvements in HOMA-IR.Both exercise regimens improved SI, as determined by OGGT, but not HOMA-IR (fasting insulin (µU/ml) x fasting glucose (mmol/L)).Matsuo et al83Twenty-six men with metabolic risk factors.Randomised control trial.Eight-week exercise intervention, three sessions per week of either: (1) HIIT, (3 × 3 min at~80–85% VO2 peak with 2 min recovery at 50% VO2 peak or (2) 40 min at 60–65% VO2 peak, followed by 4 weeks of a low-calorie diet.Both exercise interventions showed trends for improving HOMA-IR, and this was statistically significant in the HIIT group after the subsequent 4-week low-calorie diet.SI trended towards improvement with both HIIT and moderate intensity exercise, and was further improved with the low-calorie diet in the HIIT group.Inoue et al87Forty-five postpubertal, obese adolescents.Preintervention versus postintervention comparing an aerobic exercise regimen (AT), with two exercise regimens that included both aerobic exercise and resistance exercise (LP and DUP).Twenty-six weeks of exercise intervention, 3 × 60 min sessions a week.SI (HOMA-IR) improved in both the groups undertaking combined aerobic and resistance training, but statistically significant improvements were not found in the group undertaking aerobic exercise without resistance training (AT).The combination of aerobic plus resistance exercise improved SI more effectively than aerobic exercise alone.Dâmaso et al88One hundred and sixteen obese adolescents.Preintervention versus postintervention comparing: (1) aerobic exercise regimen with (2) aerobic exercise plus resistance exercise regimen.One year of: (1) an aerobic exercise regimen or (2) aerobic exercise plus resistance exercise.SI measured as HOMA-IR.While both exercise regimens improved important clinical parameters, the 'aerobic plus resistance exercise' regimen produced better metabolic outcomes than aerobic exercise alone.Nikseresht et al89Thirty-four sedentary, obese, middle-aged men.Exercise, interventions versus control condition.Twelve weeks of three sessions per week of: (1) 40–65 min of resistance training; (2) aerobic INT (4 × 4 min at 80–90% HRmax, with 3 min recovery between intervals); (3) non-exercise control.Fasting HOMA-IR.Compared with control condition, both aerobic interval training and resistance training were equally effective in reducing IR.Conceição et al90Twenty postmenopausal women.Exercise intervention, randomised controlled trial.Resistance training: 10 exercises, with 3 × 8–10 maximal repetitions three times per week.Compared with the control group, the resistance training group displayed decreases in fasting blood glucose.Resistance training performed three times a week may reduce the MetS Z-score with concomitant decreases in fasting blood glucose.Molsted et al91Twenty-three patients treated by dialysis, with (n=14) and without (n=9) IGT.Control period, followed by the exercise intervention.Sixteen weeks of strength training three times a week.After the strength training, fasting insulin, 2-hour insulin and 'area under the curve' insulin were significantly lower in patients with IGT or T2D.Strength training was associated with a significant improvement in glucose tolerance in patients with IGT or T2D undergoing dialysis. The effect was not associated with muscle hypertrophy.Mavros et al92One-hundred and three older adults with T2D.Participants were randomised to the resistance training intervention or non-exercise control group.Twelve months of resistance training 3 days per week, or sham exercise.Within the resistance training group, changes in HOMA2-IR were associated with changes in skeletal muscle mass and fat mass. Changes in visceral adipose tissue tended to be related to changes in HOMA2-IR.Improvements in metabolic health in older adults with T2D were mediated through improvements in body composition, only if they were achieved through high intensity progressive resistance training.Garnett et al93One hundred and eleven obese adolescents with prediabetes and IR.Repeated measures, exercise intervention with groups differing in dietary regimen.Twelve weeks of 45–60 min, moderate to vigorous circuit training, twice a week.OGTT following an overnight fast.SI improved within 12 weeks of commencing the exercise intervention and was still improved compared with baseline at 12 months.Trussardi Fayh et al97Forty-eight obese individuals, aged 31.8±6.0 years.Randomised clinical trial.Participants were allocated to a diet-only group or a diet and exercise group. The intervention was maintained until 5% of the initial body weight was lost.Both regimens produced significant and similar decreases of visceral adipose tissue and HOMA-IR.Five per cent weight loss reduced abdominal fat and IR in obese individuals, but exercise did not add to the effect of weight loss on the outcome variables.",https://t.co/tqStKZUwUl,others
Developing Nanotech for Better Insulin Therapy,"Bob Geho refers to himself as a ""liver evangelist"" when it comes to improving diabetes care. That's because he's on a holy mission to get insulin to be better absorbed in the bodies of PWDs (people with diabetes), using nanotechnology targetting that organ.The 50-year-old from Cleveland, OH, also happens to live with type 1 himself, diagnosed during college in the early 90s. That was a life-changing moment that shifted not only how he thought about his own health, but also set him on a career path in medical science that his father had paved before him.Today, he is CEO of Cleveland-based startup Diasome Pharmaceuticals, developing nanotechnology known as HDV (short for Hepatocyte Directed Vesicles), that would be injected as an insulin add-on or swallowed as a pill. It would attach to insulin, causing the medication to be better absorbed into the liver's metabolic cells (rather than the muscles or fat) before being released back into the bloodstream.In short, this liver-targeted compound could be a game-changer for how insulin works -- because while the medication obviously saves lives, getting the dosing right is a huge challenge, fraught with guess-work and risks. It is well-known that injected insulin doesn't work fast enough in the body, so Diasome's product could be a revolutionary fix. ""The revolution that has to happen, and that I view us as vanguard of, is a need for this kind of (more precise and predictable) insulin therapy,"" Geho says. ""It's not generally well understood either in the pharmaceutical industry or in routine clinical practice why insulin doesn't work in the liver like it should, and we think this would dramatically change the day-to-day of insulin therapy. We want to turn this whole thing upside-down.""Share on PinterestImage created by DiabetesMine Father and Son Tackle Diabetes ResearchGeho never dreamed he would follow in the footsteps of his famous medical researcher father, Dr. W. Blair Geho. His dad entered medical school in the early 60s and was taken under the wing of the great pharmacologist Dr. Earl Sutherland Jr., who won a Nobel prize in 1971 for his work on protein chemistry and was part of the team that identified ""the mystery protein of glucagon"" in the 70s.W. Blair Geho, MDStudying under Sutherland, the elder Geho learned the foundation of knowledge that he'd go on to use in developing liver-specific insulin years later. Geho joined Procter &amp; Gamble in the 60s and helped build the company's Research Division, which his son says gave him more insight into the body's chemical process than those working directly in Pharma because of P&amp;G's research on Crest toothpaste, that delved into bone metabolism. While at P&amp;G, Blair Geho also led the development of Didronel, the first bisphosphonate drug approved for human use, and Osteoscan, the first bone imaging agent.Blair Geho didn't have any personal connection to diabetes, other than family members with type 2, but his research led him down the path of liver-specific insulin. In the early 90s, he would go on to found the tech-startup SDG Inc. in Cleveland as a way to continue his work developing techniques to improve insulin delivery in diabetics.Right around that time in the early 90s, his son Bob was studying music and planning to become an orchestra conductor (following graduate business school, which he went into as a ""fallback"" in case music didn't materialize). But a routine physical led to a type 1 diagnosis, and the first call after seeing his own doctor was to his father. From that point on, diabetes became his world -- personally and professionally. It's now been 26 years.""My father was just starting SDG and continuing his odyssey of creating an insulin therapy device, so I went there and got my feet wet... the rest, as they say, is history,"" Geho says. ""I jumped ship from the music world and got very intrigued by (my father's) mindset and that kind of diabetes research.""The two have been on a joint path ever since, at the helm of several startups all aiming at the same goal: to get this HDV oral and injection insulin therapy through the research phases and onto the market. The 1994-created SDG holding tech company is now in its 25th year, and the father-son team also jointly founded Diasome Pharmaceuticals, now in its 15th year. After a down-period in which they've been quietly working on the science as well as funding, Bob Geho stepped back in as CEO and Director of Diasome a few years ago and his father now serves as Chief Science Officer.Their mission hasn't changed, and Geho tells us they're getting closer than ever before. The Concept Behind Diasome Really, the concept of HDV tech (Hepatocyte Directed Vesicles) is pretty simple to understand: making insulin work in your body the way it should, as it does in those without diabetes.As Geho puts it: ""Why can we inject twice as much insulin as a healthy, non-diabetic, but still have high blood glucose levels? Because insulin doesn't work the way it should in the body.""This illustrates the need for therapy beyond just getting the insulin into our bodies, he says.In those without diabetes, food triggers insulin from the pancreas but it first goes into the liver, where about 65% of the glucose is stored. But for us PWDs, the subcutaneous insulin we take is used first by fat and muscle cells and not the liver. So when we're taking insulin at the time of a meal, instead of the liver storing as much as two-thirds of the glucose we eat, almost all of it goes through the liver and into the blood. Only the hepatocytes in the liver can both store and then release the glucose, but that's not what happens with the insulin we're using.Think of it like the ""streetlight effect"" -- where someone is standing under a street light at night looking for their keys or a dropped coin, blocks away from where they actually dropped it; someone asks why they're not searching closer to where it was dropped, and the searcher responds: ""Better light here."" That is the equivalent of what's happening with HDV and insulin, Geho says; the Liver is the darkness and insulin just doesn't get there to work effectively. Rather, it's just going to where the light is and PWDs are left hoping it works.Geho points to recent outcomes data from the Jaeb Center and T1D Exchange showing bleak results on how few people with diabetes are actually meeting their A1C or outcomes goals. With HDV, they can help shine a little more light into those dark areas and help the insulin work better, he says.While their HDV tech is undergoing clinical trials, the vision for a product prototype could involve a few different options:Diasome could market HDV for patients to add into the vial or pen they are using in increments of 20 nanometers. The HDV nanoparticles would attach to the insulin and allow a certain portion of it, when injected into the body, to go into the PWD's liver. Nothing about the insulin structure would change, so it's simply an add-on for the life-sustaining meds we already use each day. That HDV solution could be sold right in the package with existing insulin products, for patients to add to their pens, vials or pump cartridges when ready. But it's more likely to be sold as a separate product, since insulin developers may not be keen to coupling it with their products.Or if partnerships did materialize with insulin manufacturers Lilly, Novo and Sanofi, there could be a way to add the HDV into those insulin products during the production process, as an ingredient making their insulins more effective.Diasome is also developing an oral capsule form, which contains five units of the HDV insulin molecules.""It's almost an alarmingly simple idea,"" Geho says. ""No one else in the insulin world is looking at a liver-targeted meal-time insulin therapy, and that leaves Diasome out in front -- possibly on its own."" A Big Insulin Oversight? As a type 1 himself, Geho is grateful for the insulins we have today, but certainly not content. ""Now, I love being able to inject 15 minutes before a meal, rather than longer times before that. I appreciate that and love what these companies are giving us to do that. But it's a terrible product from a day-to-day aspect. You really couldn't design a worse product. That's the reason we exist, to change that and develop a tech that allows our insulin to understand glucose metabolism.""Geho even says that new, faster injectable insulins -- including Novo's faster-acting Fiasp -- face the same challenge because they won't solve the issue of going into the liver. Inhaled insulin like Afrezza is a bit of a different animal, because it goes into the lungs rather than the liver, he says.But he can't quite understand why this liver pathway has been all but ignored to date. ""At a certain level, people should be outraged because the insulin companies aren't telling us this story,"" Geho says. ""Every high school student learns that the liver stores glucose, but for some reason the Pharma insulin-makers don't seem to realize that. It's puzzling.""While Pharma giants Lilly and Novo have abandoned their own liver-targeted insulin therapies, there continues to be quite a bit of interest in the area of research, he says. JDRF Support of Insulin and Liver StudiesSo why hasn't Diasome moved along faster in the past five years? Geho points out that there has been quite a bit of change and ""expanded thinking"" in the insulin world. This has been helped along by JDRF's T1DFund, founded in 2015 to narrow the gap between scientific advancements and commercial solutions. In 2017, that investment fund took on Diasome's research as one of its projects, which has kickstarted their clinical studies in recent years. Part of that also involves looking Beyond A1C in clinical research, so that other outcomes such as reduced hypoglycemia and Time In Range (TIR) will also be examined as they develop this HDV insulin therapy.""We are trying to be as forward-thinking as possible,"" Geho tells us.To date, Diasome has completed three human clinical studies of its HDV nanotech in PWDs with type 1:Its Phase 2 ""Good to Great"" double-blinded, multi-center study that compared injected HDV added to rapid acting insulin (lispro) versus lispro alone in 42 patients with baseline A1C levels between 6.9% and 7.9% over six weeks of dosing.Its Phase 2 ""Insulin Pump"" double-blinded crossover study that compared injected HDV added to lispro versus lispro alone in seven subjects on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion over three weeks.Its Phase 2b ""InSulin Liver Effect"" (ISLE-1) double-blinded, multi-center study that included 176 patients and compared injected HDV added to lispro versus lispro alone over six months of dosing.Going forward, more research is on tap and already underway:The first type 1 PWD has been enrolled in a Phase 2 clinical trial known as ""OPTI-1 study,"" which looks at dosing guidance for HDV injections. It's a six-month study started in March 2019, and is expected to enroll 60 people. Here is a news release on that study.If everything goes as planned, Diasome expects to work with FDA in 2019 to finalize Phase 3 clinical trial protocols, and those could begin in early 2020. If so, he hopes to have HDV additives to market by 2022.The science and concept are very intriguing, as well as the mission: to make every unit of insulin work better with the body's normal metabolic system -- making all insulins more effective and much safer. It sure will be interesting to watch Diasome and this HDV therapy move forward!Oh, and does Geho still have any music in his life?He laughs, and tells us all four of his kids play piano but for the most part music is now a strictly personal way to help clear his head when needed. The main orchestra he's conducting these days is all about insulin therapy, and the hope is that it turns out to be for the Diabetes Community what Mozart was to the music world.",https://t.co/CW0LghzZ51,others
Insulin too pricey? Some options to cut costs for diabetics,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The skyrocketing price of insulin has some diabetics scrambling to cover the cost of the life-saving medication.Others are skipping doses or using smaller amounts than needed, and sometimes landing in the emergency room, patients and advocates told Congress recently.About 7.4 million Americans use insulin to keep their blood sugar at safe levels. Insulin needs vary by patient, as do costs depending on insurance coverage.Amid the public uproar about costs, drugmakers and some prescription plans are starting to offer patients bigger discounts. Express Scripts and its parent company, insurer Cigna, just began offering a month's worth of insulin to eligible patients for $25 per month. Express Scripts is now lining up other insurers whose prescription plans it manages.For most insulin and other diabetes medicines, manufacturers offer coupons reducing monthly out-of-pocket costs.The American Diabetes Association connects patients to assistance programs through www.insulinhelp.org , though not everyone qualifies.""We do not want anyone to skip or ration doses,"" says Dr. William Cefalu, the advocacy group's chief scientific officer.If you are struggling to afford insulin, tell your doctors, says Cefalu. They might be able to recommend a free clinic or patient assistance plan, or suggest cheaper options.If cost is an issue, here are other ways to save money:TRY OLDER KINDS OF INSULINTalk to your doctor about switching to older, cheaper kinds of insulin, suggests Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Dangerous blood sugar plunges are more common with those, as they don't control blood sugar as tightly as newer, more expensive insulins. Patients using older products such as Novolin and Humulin R must test their blood sugar more often, and more carefully time when they inject insulin before meals, Gabbay stresses.SWITCH TO VIALSPatients who've been using insulin pens — injection devices containing multiple insulin doses — could switch to insulin vials. They are cheaper but less convenient. It requires drawing insulin out of the vial into a syringe, which makes doses less precise, and the abdominal injections hurt a bit more. Another option is Basaglar, a cheaper near-copy of the popular long-acting Lantus insulin pens.CHECK INSURANCEReview your insurance company's list of covered medications for insulin with the lowest copayments; coverage and copayments often change in January and there may be cheaper choices. Other savings options include getting a 90-day supply instead of 30-day refills.SHOP AROUNDCheck prices at different pharmacies. Prices can vary widely for insulin, other diabetes drugs and the testing strips and lancets needed to check blood sugar levels. Patients can look up drug prices at multiple drugstores and get coupons for big discounts at the pharmacy counter at www.GoodRx.com . Or try www.healthwarehouse.com , which sells medicines at cash prices, which can be cheaper even if you have insurance.Medicare and Medicaid patients can't combine coupons with their insurance, but a coupon alone might be the cheapest option.The three main insulin makers offer savings, including:—Sanofi's Insulins ValYOU Savings Program offers uninsured and cash-paying patients one insulin vial for $99 or one insulin pen for $149 each month. Starting in June, it will offer up to 10 vials and/or pens of most of its insulins for $99. Its Sanofi Patient Connection offers low-income uninsured patients free insulin.—Eli Lilly will soon sell Insulin Lispro, a half-price version of its top-selling insulin Humalog KwikPens, for $265 per month. Its Lilly Diabetes Solution Center helps patients find affordable options.—Novo Nordisk has long sold an older insulin, ReliOn, through Walmart for about $25 a vial. It's now available through CVS Health and Express Scripts. Novo Nordisk offers copay savings cards for Tresiba and other insulins, plus patient assistance with generous income limits at www.NovoCare.com .___Follow Linda A.

How insulin and glucagon regulate blood sugar,"How insulin and glucagon regulate blood sugarThe pancreas secretes insulin and glucagon. Both hormones work in balance to play a vital role in regulating blood sugar levels. If the level of one hormone is higher or lower than the ideal range, blood sugar levels may spike or drop.Together, insulin and glucagon help maintain a state called homeostasis in which conditions inside the body remain steady. When blood sugar is too high, the pancreas secretes more insulin. When blood sugar levels drop, the pancreas releases glucagon to raise them.This balance helps provide sufficient energy to the cells while preventing the nerve damage that can result from consistently high levels of blood sugar.In this article, we explain the functions and processes of insulin and glucagon as well as their effects on diabetes.Insulin, glucagon, and blood sugarnurse checks woman's blood sugarInsulin and glucagon affect how the body manages blood sugar levels.The body converts the carbohydrates from food into glucose, a simple sugar that serves as a vital source of energy.Blood sugar levels are a measure of how effectively the body uses glucose.These vary throughout the day. However, in most instances, insulin and glucagon keep these levels within a healthy range.When the body does not convert enough glucose, blood sugar levels remain high. Insulin helps the cells absorb glucose, reducing blood sugar and providing the cells with glucose for energy.When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon. Glucagon instructs the liver to release stored glucose, which causes blood sugar to rise.Islet cells in the pancreas are responsible for releasing both insulin and glucagon. The pancreas contains many clusters of these cells. There are several different types of islet cell, including beta cells, which release insulin, and alpha cells, which release glucagon.An overview of insulinAn overview of insulinLearn more about the different types of insulin by clicking here.READ NOWHow insulin worksThe cells need glucose for energy. However, most of them are unable to use glucose without the help of insulin.Insulin gives glucose access to the cells. It attaches to the insulin receptors on cells throughout the body, instructing the cells to open up and grant entry to glucose.Low levels of insulin constantly circulate throughout the body. A spike in insulin signals to the liver that blood glucose is also high. The liver absorbs glucose then changes it into a storage molecule called glycogen.When blood sugar levels drop, glucagon instructs the liver to convert the glycogen back to glucose, causing blood sugar levels to return to normal.Insulin also supports healing after an injury by delivering amino acids to the muscles. Amino acids help build the protein that is present in muscle tissue, so when insulin levels are low, muscles may not heal properly.How glucagon worksThe liver stores glucose to power the cells during periods of low blood sugar. Skipping meals and poor nutrition can lower blood sugar. By storing glucose, the liver makes sure that blood glucose levels remain steady between meals and during sleep.When blood glucose falls, cells in the pancreas secrete glucagon. Glucagon instructs the liver to convert glycogen to glucose, making glucose more available in the bloodstream.From there, insulin attaches to its receptors on the body's cells and ensures that they can absorb glucose.Insulin and glucagon work in a cycle. Glucagon interacts with the liver to increase blood sugar, while insulin reduces blood sugar by helping the cells use glucose.Ideal blood sugar levelsA range of factors, including insulin resistance, diabetes, and an unbalanced diet, can cause blood sugar levels to spike or plummet.The standard measurement units for blood sugar levels are milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Ideal blood sugar ranges are as follows:TimingBlood glucose level (mg/dL)Before breakfastPerson without diabetes: 100 mg/dLPerson with diabetes: 70–132 hours after a mealPerson without diabetes: Less than 140 mg/dLPerson with diabetes: Less than 180 mg/dLBedtimePerson without diabetes: 120 mg/dLPerson with diabetes: 90–150 mg/dLA1C is a measurement that gives a picture of average glucose levels over an extended period. A1C readings should be under 7 percent for people with diabetes and less than 6 percent for those without diabetes.Read more about optimal blood sugar levels by clicking here.How blood sugar levels affect the bodyInsulin and glucagon do not take immediate effect, particularly in people whose blood sugar levels are extremely high or low.High blood sugarman itchingDiabetes can cause itching.The symptoms of high blood sugar include:Urinating more often than usual: The kidneys respond to high blood sugar by trying to get rid of excess glucose.Excessive thirst that accompanies frequent urination: The kidneys can cause dehydration and feelings of intense thirst when trying to regulate blood sugar.Feeling excessively hungry: High blood sugar does not directly cause feelings of hunger. However, a drop in insulin often causes hunger when it accompanies high blood sugar.Over time, extremely high blood sugar may lead to the following symptoms:unexplained weight lossslow healingitchy, dry skinincreased likelihood of infectionsheadachesfatigue or difficulty concentratingblurred visionconstipation, diarrhea, or botherectile dysfunctionLow blood sugarDelays between meals, poor nutrition, some diabetes medications, and certain medical conditions can cause low blood sugar.The symptoms of low blood sugar include:dizzinessrapid heartbeatweaknesstingling, particularly in the tongue, lips, arms, or legshunger alongside nauseafaintingconfusion and difficulty concentratingirritabilityWithout treatment, low blood sugar can lead to seizures or loss of consciousness.Types of diabetesDiabetes develops either when insulin becomes ineffective or when the body cannot produce enough of it. The disease causes problems with blood sugar regulation.There are several different types of diabetes:Type 1 diabetesType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that often presents at a young age. For this reason, it is sometimes called juvenile diabetes.This type of diabetes involves attacks by the immune system on some of the insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas.People with type 1 diabetes often experience very high blood sugar. Low insulin levels, however, mean that they cannot use much of the glucose in their blood.Type 2 diabetesType 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, and it usually develops due to lifestyle issues, such as being overweight.People with type 2 diabetes have insulin resistance, which means that the cells do not respond properly when insulin instructs them to absorb glucose from the bloodstream.Gestational diabetespregnant person with partnerDiabetes can develop in women who are pregnant.Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that develops in some women during pregnancy.When a woman is pregnant, the placenta that supports the developing baby might impair her body's ability to use insulin.The result of this is insulin resistance that triggers symptoms similar to those of type 2 diabetes.Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born. However, it is a risk factor for the later development of type 2 diabetes.SummaryInsulin and glucagon are vital for maintaining normal ranges of blood sugar.Insulin allows the cells to absorb glucose from the blood, while glucagon triggers a release of stored glucose from the liver.Everyone who has type 1 diabetes and some people with type 2 diabetes will need to supplement their insulin and manage their blood sugar through diet and regular exercise.",https://t.co/5g74TeJYU0,others

A high-monounsaturated-fat/low-carbohydrate diet improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients,"A high-monounsaturated-fat/low-carbohydrate diet improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patientsA high-monounsaturated-fat/low-carbohydrate diet improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patientsParillo, M.; Rivellese, A.A.; Ciardullo, A.V.; Capaldo, B.; Giacco, A.; Genovese, S.; Riccardi, G.Metabolism Clinical &amp; Experimental 41(12): 1373-13781992It is commonly believed that high-carbohydrate (CHO) diets improve peripheral insulin sensitivity; however, this concept is based on anecdotal evidence. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients treated with insulin, a high-monounsaturated-fat (MUFA) diet is more effective than a high-complex-CHO diet in reducing blood glucose levels. The aim of our study was to compare the effect of a high-MUFA diet and a high-CHO diet on peripheral insulin sensitivity and metabolic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Ten non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients aged 52 +- 8 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 26.7 +- 3.5 kg/m-2 who were being treated with diet alone (n = 5) or with diet plus glibenclamide (n = 5) were randomly assigned to a 15-day period of either a high-MUFA/low-CHO diet (CHO, 40%; fat, 40%; protein, 20%; fiber, 24g) or a low-MUFA/high-CHO diet (CHO, 60%; fat, 20%; protein, 20%; fiber, 24g) and were then crossed-over to the other diet. Diets were similar in their content of monosaccharides, disaccharides, and saturated fats, and were administered to the patients in a metabolic ward. The dosage of hypoglycemic drugs was maintained at a constant level throughout the study. With the high-MUFA/low-CHO diet, a decrease in both postprandial glucose (8.76 +- 2.12 v 10.08 +- 2.76 mmol/L; P lt .05) and plasma insulin (195.0 +- 86.4 v 224.4 +- 75.6 pmol/L; P lt .02) levels was observed. Furthermore, fasting plasma triglyceride levels were reduced after the high-MUFA fat/low-CHO diet (1.16 +- 0.59 v 1.37 +- 0.59 mmol/L; P lt .01). Insulin-mediated glucose disposal, evaluated with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (470 pmol/L) clamp, was significantly higher with the high-MUFA/low-CHO diet (5.8 +- 2.1 v 4.6 +- 1.8 mg/kg/min; P = .02). This study demonstrates that a high-MUFA/low-CHO diet has clinical and metabolic benefits in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients.(PDF emailed within 0-6 h: $19.90)Accession: 002284030Download citation: RIS BibTeX TextPMID: 1461145DOI: 10.1016/0026-0495(92)90111-mCarbohydrate and lipid metabolism in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet vs a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids.

Dr Jason Fung: Therapeutic Fasting and Weight Loss,"Dr Jason Fung is a Canadian nephrologist. Seeing many diabetic patients with kidney complications, he has taken special interest in obesity and diabetes. He has pioneered the use of therapeutic fasting regimens for weight loss and type 2 diabetes control, with great success, at his Intensive Dietary Management clinic in Toronto. This talk was given at the Public Health Collaboration conference 2017 in Manchester.The current international consensus is that a caloric deficit (weight gain = calories in – calories out) is required to achieve weight loss, and that this is achieved by eating less and exercising more. But when looking at the scientific literature, it is clear that this approach is not very well evidenced at all. For example, the TODAY Study found that over 60 months, metformin plus lifestyle changes (in the form of the eat less, exercise more approach) was no more effective for weight loss than metformin alone, with neither group losing any weight. In fact, according to the UK General Practice Database 2004-2014, the probability of an obese person achieving a normal weight by following 'eat less, exercise more' advice is 0.6%. In addition, 80% of people managing a 10% reduction in weight will regain this weight within a year. This effectively means that the vast majority of calorie restriction or 'eat less, exercise more' strategies are doomed to fail.So why does the current model not work? The main reason for the failure of calorie restriction is that the body, as a survival mechanism, lowers its basal metabolic rate (BMR) when calorie intake is reduced. Therefore, when the body is taking in less calories, it's also burning less too. This leads to reduced energy levels, increased hunger (which involves changes to satiety hormones) and trouble staying warm. The worst part of this is, when the BMR falls enough to match caloric intake, weight loss stalls or even reverses. We have actually known this for around a century, with the findings being reiterated fairly often since. In addition, exercise has also proven an ineffective tool in preventing and reversing weight gain in the long term. The potential reasons for this are increased hunger following exercise and compensation for increased exercise with longer periods of rest. Thus, neither manipulation of calorie intake, nor the amount of exercise, is managing to achieve weight loss.The key to losing weight is breaking into the body's fat stores for energy, and the main hormone that controls this is insulin. Eating food, particularly carbohydrates, throughout the day maintains raised levels of insulin, even if the overall calorie intake is reduced. This instructs the body to switch off lipolysis (fat burning) whilst activating lipogenesis (fat creation), resulting in fat gain. On the other hand, abstaining from caloric intake altogether, for an extended period of time, lowers insulin levels and allows lipolysis to be switched back on, thus, the body is permitted to break into its fat stores for energy. This practice is called intermittent fasting and has physiological effects distinct from those of calorie restriction. During periods of fasting, not only is BMR maintained via increased noradrenaline levels, but there is also no net increase in hunger, measured via ghrelin levels. Furthermore, intermittent fasting also preserves lean body mass, and so is said to be muscle-sparing.People cannot just make a decision to burn more fat calories, or to feel less hungry. These are physiological issues and must be addressed via physiology. It is time to stop scolding people for lack of willpower, and to start showing them how to lose weight in a healthy fashion, without torturing themselves.",https://t.co/jHEyJ1iBH5,others

In Experiment 1, cumulus-oocyte complexes were matured in the absence or presence of IGF-I (100 ng.mL(-1)) and then vitrified-warmed with or without 2mM of GSH. Maturation rate was evaluated before vitrification, and oocyte viability, DNA fragmentation and relative transcript abundances of BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX), BCL2-like1 (BCL2L1), heat shock protein 70 (HSPA1A), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) genes were assessed in fresh and vitrified-warmed oocytes. In Experiment 2, fresh and vitrified-warmed oocytes were in vitro fertilized and their developmental competence determined. Whereas the addition of IGF-I to maturation medium had no effect on oocyte maturation, it caused an increase in the survival rate of vitrified-warmed oocytes. This effect was accompanied by a concomitant augment in the relative transcript abundance of HSPA1A and a decrease of BAX. Furthermore, the addition of GSH to vitrification-warming media increased survival rates at post-warming. Likewise, the action of GSH was concomitant with an increase in the relative abundance of GPX1 and a decrease of BAX transcript. Blastocyst rates of vitrified-warmed oocytes did not differ from their fresh counterparts when IGF-I and GSH were combined. In conclusion, supplementing maturation medium with 100 ng.mL(-1) IGF-I and vitrification-warming solutions with 2 mM GSH improves the quality and cryotolerance of IVM pig oocytes, through a mechanism that involves BAX, GPX1 and HSPA1A expression.(PDF emailed within 0-6 h: $19.90)Accession: 066383436Download citation: RIS BibTeX TextPMID: 30692931DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.01894In-vitro development of vitrified-warmed bovine oocytes after activation may be predicted based on mathematical modelling of cooling and warming rates during vitrification, storage and sample removal.

Objective: Characterize the effectiveness of insulin glargine alone, exenatide alone, or combined in subjects taking stable doses of metformin and evaluate their impact on hemoglobin A1C, hypoglycemia, weight, and glucose variability. Methods: Open-label, randomized, parallel-arm study of adults with type 2 diabetes naïve to both insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist who were not at A1C goal despite treatment with metformin. This prospective interventional study employed blinded continuous glucose monitoring ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) reports over 32 weeks. Subjects were randomized to treatment with glargine (Iglar), exenatide (GLP-1), or combination of glargine and exenatide (Iglar + GLP-1). At midpoint, those not at A1C target had the second medication added; those on Iglar + GLP-1 continued therapy optimization. Results: Decreases in A1C were: 7.6 to 6.2% for Iglar + GLP-1, 7.5 to 6.6% for Iglar, and 7.5 to 6.4% for GLP-1. Iglar + GLP-1 achieved A1C targets faster (14 to 16 weeks) but had more hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia rates increased slightly for all arms. Weight loss was achieved in all regimens including GLP-1. Glucose variability was not reduced to the same extent in the Iglar arm as the GLP-1 arm. Conclusion: Addition of Iglar and/or GLP-1 to metformin for patients not at treatment goal was safe and effective. The order of medication addition needs to consider individualized AGP patterns and goals. Iglar + GLP-1 resulted in rapid A1C lowering, whereas GLP-1 was noted to have less hypoglycemia. Weight loss was most pronounced in GLP-1 monotherapy, suggesting that GLP-1 may mitigate the weight gain of Iglar. Any treatment with GLP-1 showed significant decreases in glucose variability.

This study aimed to investigate the association of calorie and carbohydrate intake with tumor grade in early detection of breast cancer in Iranian women. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 62 women with high grade breast cancer were included in the study as the case group and control group included 93 women with low breast cancer grade. Information about confounding variables was collected through a questionnaire. Dietary intake of calorie and macronutrient was assessed by a valid 122-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The subjects were categorized according to quartiles of calorie and carbohydrate intake. Results: Individuals with high grade breast cancer had significantly more calorie (0.16, 0.04-0.61) and carbohydrate intake (4.02; 1.28-12.63) compared with those with low grade breast cancer after controlling for age. This correlation remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors including body mass index, age at menarche, Physical activity, smoking, family history, and taking contraceptives and estrogen. Conclusion: Our results showed that high intakes of dietary calorie and carbohydrate are directly related to the high grade of tumor in people with breast cancer after modifying a wide range of confounding factors. Further studies in this area may help to provide appropriate nutritional advice to cancer patients.Keywordsbreast cancer; Macronutrients; Calorie intake; Tumor gradeMain SubjectsEpidemiology generalStatisticsArticle View: 557",https://t.co/boUHm6EeMW,others
Effects of Coffee Consumption on Fasting Blood Glucose and Insulin Concentrations,"Randomized controlled trials in healthy volunteersHigher habitual coffee consumption was associated with higher insulin sensitivity (1) and a lower risk for type 2 diabetes (2–6) in diverse populations. In contrast, short-term metabolic studies showed that caffeine intake can acutely lower insulin sensitivity (7–9) and increase glucose concentrations (10–15). Randomized intervention studies are needed to examine whether tolerance to these acute effects develops after longer-term consumption (16). We therefore examined the effects of coffee and caffeine on fasting blood concentrations of glucose and insulin over 2–4 weeks in two crossover studies in healthy volunteers.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThe studies were approved by the TNO Nutrition and Food Research Medical Ethics Committee, and all participants gave informed consent. The trials were originally designed to study the effects of coffee and caffeine on plasma concentrations of homocysteine, and the study designs have been reported in detail previously (17,18). Participants were regular coffee consumers (more than five cups/day) and did not have known diabetes.The first study was a 4-week crossover study that compared the effects of regular paper-filtered coffee consumption with that of coffee abstinence. A total of 40 volunteers used 1 l of coffee (70 g coffee grounds) for 4 weeks and abstained from coffee for 4 weeks in random order. Fourteen participants did not complete the trial because of nausea and restlessness (n = 7), possible susceptibility to adverse effects of caffeine intake (n = 3), or reasons unrelated to treatment (n = 4). Thus, 26 participants were included in the analysis. The second study had a Latin-square design with three treatments given in random order for 2 weeks each: caffeine (a total of 870 mg in six capsules), regular paper-filtered coffee (52 g ground coffee/day in 0.9 l), and placebo (six capsules containing cellulose). Of the 54 volunteers, 6 subjects withdrew because of severe headaches (n = 2), study-related illness (n = 1), or reasons unrelated to treatment (n = 3). For the current analyses, we excluded participants because of missing blood samples (n = 1), not completing the whole caffeine intervention (n = 1), or who were clear outliers for an insulin concentration (n = 1). Thus, 45 subjects were included in the analysis. Caffeine-containing products (other than those provided) were prohibited during the entire trial. Venous blood samples were collected after an overnight fast. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured using the glucose hexokinase method. Serum insulin concentrations were measured using an immunoradiometric assay (Medgenix Biosource Diagnostics, Fleuris, Belgium).In study 1, treatment responses were compared using paired t tests. In study 2, we tested for overall treatment effects using ANOVA. All reported P values were two sided, and P values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSStudy 1Of the participants that completed the study, 62% were women, mean (±SD) age was 37 ± 12 years, and mean BMI was 23 ± 3 kg/m2. After 2 weeks, coffee consumption tended to lead to higher fasting glucose concentrations, but no appreciable effect was observed after 4 weeks (Table 1). Fasting insulin concentrations, measured only after 4 weeks, were higher after the coffee period than after the no coffee period (Table 1). Tests for carry-over effects did not indicate that these existed (insulin: P = 0.79; glucose: P = 0.27).Study 2Of the participants that completed the study, 56% were women, mean age was 40 ± 14 years, and mean BMI was 24 ± 3 kg/m2. Fasting glucose concentrations were similar after the caffeine, coffee, and placebo period (Table 1). Compared with the placebo period, fasting insulin concentrations tended to be higher after the coffee and caffeine periods (Table 1).CONCLUSIONSWe found that high coffee consumption for 4 weeks increased fasting insulin concentrations compared with coffee abstinence. Consumption of somewhat weaker coffee and caffeine intake were nonsignificantly associated with higher fasting insulin concentrations. No substantial effects of coffee or caffeine on fasting glucose concentrations were observed.The increased fasting insulin concentration after high coffee consumption in our study probably reflects decreased insulin sensitivity. In short-term metabolic studies, caffeine intake acutely lowered insulin sensitivity over 100–180 min (7–9). In a study of 5 days of caffeine intake, complete tolerance to the effects of caffeine on fasting glucose concentrations developed (19), but effects on norepinephrine and free fatty acid concentrations partly remained for the high-dose caffeine treatment. Thus, effects of high amounts of caffeine on catecholamines and free fatty acids may have contributed to a decrease in insulin sensitivity in our studies. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the elevated insulin concentrations after coffee consumption were due to higher insulin secretion (20) or to reduced hepatic insulin clearance as a result of increased free fatty acid concentrations (21).Our findings seem to be at variance with the inverse association between coffee consumption and risk for type 2 diabetes that has been observed in cohort studies (2–6). Several factors may contribute to this discrepancy. First, the results of cohort studies may reflect the effects of decades of regular coffee consumption, whereas the present study compared 2–4 weeks of coffee consumption with 2–4 weeks of coffee abstinence. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that the rapid transition to high coffee consumption (equivalent to ∼13 conventional cups of coffee in study 1) in our studies had detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity. For example, experienced psychological stress may have lowered insulin sensitivity through increased stress hormone concentrations. Third, habitual coffee consumption may improve aspects of glucose metabolism that are not reflected in the outcome parameters of the present study (for example, postprandial glucose metabolism).In conclusion, the present results indicate that tolerance to the adverse effects of high coffee consumption on insulin-glucose homeostasis does not develop within a 4-week period. This stresses that it is premature to advocate high coffee consumption as a means to lower risk for type 2 diabetes. Long-term trials of coffee consumption that include detailed measures of insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism are warranted to elucidate the apparent discrepancy with studies that observed an inverse association between habitual coffee consumption and risk for type 2 diabetes.Table 1— Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations after paper-filtered regular coffee consumption, caffeine intake, and coffee/caffeine abstinenceAcknowledgmentsSupported by the Wageningen Center for Food Sciences, an alliance of Dutch food industries; TNO Nutrition and Food Research; Maastricht University; and Wageningen University and Research Center, with financial support from the Dutch government.We thank the volunteers for their participation, all those involved at TNO Nutrition and Food Research for their dedication, and the laboratory staff at the Vrije Universiteit Medical Center for their careful analysis.References↵Arnlov J, Vessby B, Riserus U: Coffee consumption and insulin sensitivity.

AACE 2019 Poster Gallery,"(14) ULTRA-RAPID PROFILE OF INSULIN HUMAN INHALATION POWDER MIMICS TIME-ACTION PROFILE OF PHYSIOLOGIC ABSORPTION OF GLUCOSE FROM MIXED-MEAL TOLERANCE TESTS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES Authors: David Kendall, MD – Chief Medical Officer, MannKind Corporation, Westlake Village, CARich Bergenstal, MD – Executive Director, International Diabetes Center, Park Nicollet, Minneapolis, MNSimon Bruce, MD – Clinical Development, Kinexum Services LLC, San Diego, CAAnne Peters, MD – Director, USC Clinical Diabetes Programs, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CAMarshall Grant, PhD, MSc – Senior Director, Clinical Pharmacology, MannKind Corporation, Westlake Village, CAFrank Pompilio, PharmD – Vice President, Medical Affairs, MannKind Corporation, Westlake Village, CA Abstract: Objective : To compare the metabolic responses to 2 insulins demonstrating distinctly different pharmacokinetic profiles, Technosphere® Insulin (TI) inhalation powder and subcutaneous insulin lispro (LIS). TI inhalation powder undergoes ultra-rapid absorption with a correspondingly fast onset and quick rise to peak action with a short duration of effect. LIS is absorbed more slowly with a longer time to peak action and longer duration of glucose-lowering effect.Methods : Twelve patients with type 2 diabetes underwent 2 mixed-meal tolerance tests after receiving LIS 10 U (n=12) or TI 16 or 24 units (n=6 per dose) in random order in a cross-over design. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) rate and glucose absorption (Ra) and disposal rates (Rd) were derived from tracer data.Results : With TI, the maximum Rd and maximum EGP suppression occurred 30 to 45 minutes after the start of the meal and coincided with the maximum Ra from the meal. With LIS, pharmacodynamic effects peaked after the maximum Ra.Discussion : The mean PPG curves for the 3 treatments demonstrated that TI achieves nearly constant glucose concentrations for 90 minutes after the start of the meal, while PPG significantly rises within the first 30 minutes after administration of LIS. The mean PPG excursion of the group receiving TI 24 units did not exceed 10 mg/dL during the first 90 minutes. In contrast, the PPG excursion after LIS 10 U required less than 20 minutes to reach 10 mg/dL. A dose of TI 16 units controlled PPG excursions below 10 mg/dL for more than 45 minutes. Differences from the LIS-PPG curve were statistically significant from 30 to 60 minutes at the low dose of TI and from 45 to 105 minutes at the higher dose of TI. The tight control of early PPG results from the agreement in timing of TI's insulin-induced glucose demand and glucose absorption from a mixed meal. The duration of PPG control is dose dependent. Consistent with its short duration of effect, PPG started to rise approximately 120 minutes after dosing, but TI's rapid clearance suggests a small supplemental dose may be taken at that time to extend control with little risk of late postprandial hypoglycemia.Conclusion : These studies confirm that TI, with its well-timed, insulin-mediated glucose disposal and suppression of EGP, can handle early absorption of glucose during mixed meals.",https://t.co/YHVhoTuK0U,others
Teaching Patients How to Use Inhaled Insulin,"Anne L. Peters, MD: Ever since I completed a research study using inhaled insulin, I found myself using it a lot more frequently. I realized that in doing this study, not only did I get used to it and how it worked in my patients, but I also developed a way to teach patients how to use it. I basically reduced the barriers to my using it, and now I use it often; therefore, I'm quite comfortable with it. I wanted to share that experience with you and also have you learn from Mark Harmel, my diabetes educator, who is so good at teaching patients how to use it that it works quite effectively. Inhaled insulin works as follows. You have a patient pick a dose; it comes in a cartridge of 4, 8, or 12 units. The patient takes the dose just before eating. The insulin works very fast and it also goes away pretty quickly. It helps the patient really catch that first postprandial rise. If the patient's glucose level is high after eating, they can take another puff to bring down that blood glucose level. It doesn't cause the stacking phenomenon that you get with injected insulin. When to Take It Inhaled insulin is really good at the start of a meal. It's also a great correction insulin. My patients will use it after a meal—1 to 2 hours later if they have high levels—or when they're running high. For example, if a patient is on a sensor and he sees that his levels have been high all afternoon, he can take a puff of the inhaled insulin and his glucose level will come back down without going too low. Inhaled insulin is an incredibly useful tool for my patients with diabetes. I use it in both type 1 individuals and people with type 2 diabetes who are on insulin. The way I start patients is by having them pick one meal—usually dinner. I'm not a big believer in having a patient switch entirely to a different way [of taking insulin]. Obviously, patients stay on their basal insulin and I usually have them get used to taking it before dinner. How Much to Take Many patients may be nervous at first and they often don't take enough. They say, ""Oh, I only need 4 units."" Well, that's not true in most cases; they'll need 8 or 12 units. I let them work up and then see the effects. It's easy for patients who are on a continuous glucose monitor to see the effect of the inhaled insulin and see if their blood sugar is subsequently high. Those who are self-monitoring blood glucose with finger sticks can test an hour or two after a meal to see if they need a correction. I'll start patients with taking it with one meal a day and then advance to more meals per day as they fit this into their routine. I see it as an exceedingly useful tool to add to what my patients already have for managing their diabetes. Some patients will use it often (for every meal), some patients use it for correction, and some patients use it for both. The key to getting a patient to use inhaled insulin comfortably is in the teaching. I'm going to have Mark give you a lesson on how to teach your patients the correct way to use inhaled insulin. Teaching Your Patients Mark Harmel, MPH: Thank you, Anne. When I get study participants or patients in the clinic, the first thing I do is a lung test. We have to check and see if their lungs are healthy enough to use inhaled insulin. We use this device that measures lung capacity to do the FEV1 test. There is a little cardboard tube that goes onto this device. The patient takes a deep breath and blows it out very quickly, and then we measure the reading on the front of the device. We put that into a CDC website calculator, and if their lung capacity is at 75% or more, they qualify to use inhaled insulin. Next, you have to teach the patient how to inhale. There is this inhaler that's about the size of a whistle. You pop it open, and there are individual cartridges that you insert into the inhaler. You can see that there's a little point on the tip of one of them, and the tub that holds the powdered insulin is at the bottom. The tub goes down, you fit the point on the cartridge to the point on the inside of the inhaler, and then you snap it closed. Once you close the inhaler, it's important to keep it level because the insulin will fall out if you tip it over. Take off the mouth guard, take a little sip of water, inhale smoothly and gently, hold it in your lungs for a few seconds, and then exhale. There's a video on the Afrezza website that worked wonders for some of my patients. We also have to teach patients how to take care of the insulin. Inside the package, there are two folded pieces of paper. One of them has the typical drug warnings that are in many of your medications. Another paper has some nice illustrated instructions. There is also the refrigeration page. Just like your liquid insulin, you have to keep it refrigerated. It could take a couple of days or a week before patients really get the hang of using inhaled insulin. Be conservative to start, and make sure that patients have their fast-acting glucose with them in case they use too much. They'll learn how to use it over time. Many people find that they really like inhaled insulin as an option. Some people shift to it completely for mealtime use and others only use it occasionally. Your patients will find what's right for them. Peters: Thank you very much for that, Mark. If you feel comfortable with this, take the time to teach your patients, and have them watch the appropriate videos. You can teach your patients to quickly become experts in using inhaled insulin. Hopefully, it can help improve their outcomes.",https://t.co/83bTLDQiy0,others
Insulin crisis: Skyrocketing prices sending patients to Canada,"The American Diabetes Association says the average price of insulin tripled between 2002 and 2013. That's sending many Americans to Canada, where they pay up to 10 times less per vial. The FDA allows it if it's for personal use and a three-month supply or less. The rising prices are also causing diabetics in this country to skip doses or ration their insulin, which can mean serious complications or death. Adam Kozie is an insulin-dependent diabetic. His cost of a vial of insulin shot up from $40 to $135, even though he has insurance. ""I was exasperated, paying so much for my drugs. I need this to keep myself alive,"" Kozie said. Kozie's doctor, Irl Hirsch, professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told him he could drive to Canada, save money and get more than the one-month supply. ""That's a huge benefit to being able to buy in Canada without a prescription, is that I have a fridge full of insulin right now. If something goes wrong, I have a huge supply of the thing that I need to stay alive,"" Kozie said. A diabetic himself, Hirsch has studied insulin prices for decades. He said Humalog went from $24 a vial when it came out in 1996 to $300 full retail now. People can get Humalog in Canada for $32 Canadian. ""That means they're making money on that $30 vial of insulin, which in the U.S. at retail cost is 10 times that price,"" Hirsch said. ""It just infuriates me to no end that this drug that we've had for almost 100 years is inaccessible for so many people."" He said the difference is Canada regulates drug costs, the U.S. does not. ""We are now hearing of not just hospitalizations for people who have rationed or run out of their insulin, but now, this year, we are hearing of deaths,"" Hirsch said. He said he'll keep fighting until insulin is accessible and affordable, and he hopes change is coming. Several insulin makers are named in a class action lawsuit for alleged price fixing. The companies themselves are launching programs to make insulin more affordable, especially for the 3.2 million uninsured Americans. Patients do have another option now in the U.S.: they can buy less expensive human or synthetic insulin for as little as $25 at Walmart. But it's an older insulin and may act differently.

Insulin allergy can be successfully managed by a systematic approach,"This study was conducted retrospectively and included data from the Allergy Centre database, ACbase, on patients seen at the Odense Research Center for Anaphylaxis (ORCA), Allergy Centre at Odense University Hospital from 2003 through March 2017 with suspicion of insulin allergy. Since 2010 the Allergy Centre in Odense has been the only place in Denmark to evaluate patients suspected of insulin allergy in collaboration with the Department of Endocrinology, Odense University Hospital.The examination comprised a comprehensive medical history (type of diabetes, duration and severity of symptoms, prior treatment etc.), measurement of specific IgE against human, bovine, and porcine insulin and—where appropriate—also ICT with different insulins.Specific IgE measurement (ImmunoCAP) against human, bovine and porcine insulin was performed by Thermo Fisher, Uppsala Sweden. Values above 0.35 kIU/L were considered positive.Intracutaneous tests were performed by injecting 20–50 µL of the different insulins in the concentration 5 IE/mL, and reactions were considered positive if the wheal size diameter was 3 mm larger than the initial bleb. ICTs were read after 20 min, according to guidelines from the European Network on Drug Allergy (ENDA) [13]. As controls, skin prick tests were performed with histamine 10 mg/mL (ALK-Abello, Denmark) as the positive control and isotonic NaCl as the negative control.The insulins available for the test varied over time, and some of the first patients seen (n = 3) were only tested with a selection of the available insulin types, based on the clinician's judgment. The majority, however, were tested with the full panel of insulins, which included rapid acting human insulin (Humulin Regular®, Insuman Rapid®, Actrapid®), rapid acting analogue insulin lispro (Humalog®), and insulin aspart (NovoRapid®), and intermediate acting isophane human insulin (Humulin NPH®, Insulatard®, both containing protamine), and long acting analogue insulin: Insulin glargine (Lantus®), and insulin detemir (Levemir®). Most recently, the following additions have been made to the panel: Toujeo®, Abasaglar® (both insulin glargine), Tresiba (insulin deglucec), NovoMix® (insulin aspart with added protamine), and Apidra® (insulin glulisine).SPT with insulin was initially a part of the examination but was abandoned due to the poor sensitivity and specificity of the test. Basophil histamine release (HR test) was performed in a few patients but not systematically. Consequently, the results of SPT and HR test are omitted.The patients—or in the case of children, their parents—gave informed consent to store their data in the ACbase. All data for this study were collected after approval from the Danish Data Protection Agency (17/11270).",https://t.co/3d8HIhOZn8,others
US Lawmakers Hone in on PBM Role in Insulin Prices,"US lawmakers are focusing on the role that pharmaceutical middlemen may play in the rising cost of insulin, which is making the critical drug unaffordable for many people with diabetes. Influential members of Congress from both parties say they will work together to try to put insulin within financial reach of more Americans. It's estimated that around 7.5 million Americans are taking insulin, including 1.2 million who have type 1 diabetes and require daily insulin. Type 2 diabetes, which affects nearly 30 million Americans according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), is treated with a variety of other medications but many of those patients may also eventually become dependent on insulin. In letters released yesterday, leaders of the Senate Finance Committee demanded detailed information from three of the nation's biggest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs): Cigna's Express Scripts, CVS Health Corp, and UnitedHealth's Optum unit. The senators want to bring into the light the often unseen mechanisms that let PBMs profit from serving as a go-between on insulin prescriptions between patients and manufacturers. ""Even though insulin has been used to treat diabetes for almost 100 years, its price has continued to increase, putting stress on patients and taxpayers alike,"" wrote Senate Finance Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee's ranking Democrat. The information demanded by Grassley and Wyden will likely frame the debate for an April 9 Senate Finance hearing on PBMs. Senate Finance has also summoned executives from Humana and Prime Therapeutics to appear at the hearing. And in the House of Representatives yesterday, a hearing with diabetes experts also set the stage for an expected deeper examination of insulin costs later this month. Prices for commonly prescribed insulins rose over the past two decades from about $20 per vial to over $250 per vial — a more than 700% increase after adjusting for inflation, said the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee in a background memo for the hearing. Spiraling insulin prices reflect poorly on the work of PBMs as negotiators, at least when it comes to serving patients, according to Rep. Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter (R-GA), who owns drugstores in his community and describes himself as Congress' only pharmacist. ""Their mission is to keep prescription drug prices low,"" Carter said at the hearing. ""Well, I would ask you, 'How's that working out?' Obviously, it's not working out very well at all."" Call for More Transparency Around PBM Pricing Strategies Like the Senate Finance Committee, Carter argues for a need for greater information about the rebates paid to PBMs. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed a plan to allow discounts on prescription medicines to flow more directly to patients in the Medicare Part D pharmacy program, while disrupting the flow of rebates to PBMs. Carter and his Democratic and Republican colleagues want more open access to information about PBMs' rebates, price concessions, and other direct or indirect remuneration in prescription drug plans. The House Energy and Commerce's Health Subcommittee last month approved a bill to increase transparency in drug pricing that Carter had put forward with Democratic and GOP colleagues. It would provide the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission with more access to data on rebates, a step that could aid Congress with future PBM legislation. ""When you have three PBMs that control almost 80% of the market, I don't think we have enough competition in that area,"" Carter said. ""We need transparency. It's the only way that we're ever going to see exactly how we attack this problem that impacts everyone. It is a nonpartisan problem."" There's deep shared interest among Democrats and Republicans in Congress in addressing drug costs, with insulin a particular cause of concern. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, said she and her GOP counterpart on the panel had planned yesterday's hearing together. She and Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, the panel's ranking Republican, had agreed on the selection of witnesses. That's a break from tradition, in which the minority party usually gets to weigh in on only one choice of a witness for a hearing, DeGette said. DeGette has a notable track record for helping bring both parties together to pass health law. She was a key lawmaker behind the 2016 passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, a law meant to aid biomedical research. DeGette has cited her daughter's type 1 diabetes as one of her reasons for championing that measure. ""We are committed to fixing this,"" said DeGette at the hearing on insulin prices. ""We are committed to a bipartisan solution."" Why Can't CMS Pay for Insulin? A perhaps more surprising example of bipartisanship at the hearing was a quick endorsement from Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a liberal Democrat from Illinois, for an idea tossed out by Rep. Michael C. Burgess, MD, a conservative Republican from Texas. Burgess suggested having Medicare and Medicaid pick up the tab for insulin for patients with diabetes. Burgess and Schakowsky spoke of this idea as a potential cost saver for these programs, sparing them from having to pay to treat complications people suffer because of poorly controlled diabetes. ""Why do we even charge for insulin? If someone has got a diagnosis of diabetes, why not just treat it?"" Burgess said. ""Why would the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] not just cover that?"" Skipping doses of insulin because of cost puts people at risk for ""devastating and sometimes deadly complications,"" including cardiovascular and kidney disease, blindness, and lower-limb amputations, William T. Cefalu, MD, chief scientific and medical officer of the ADA, told the House panel. ""The amount of money a person pays for insulin is going to have a direct effect on their adherence,"" Cefalu said in reply to Burgess' suggestion. ""Whatever we can do to lower the cost of insulin is going to increase adherence."" Burgess noted that Energy and Commerce has jurisdiction for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. He said he intended to follow up with CMS Administrator Seema Verma on the idea of providing insulin without charging patients in government health plans. ""In a federal program, why don't we just cover it?"" Burgess wondered. ""That's a question that I think this committee in Congress needs to ask,"" replied Cefalu. Sellers' Market: Patients Skimping on Insulin a Common Occurrence In his testimony, Cefalu also urged Congress to have the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) further streamline the process for clearing so-called biosimilar insulins. Prices for these copycat versions of pricier insulin analogs won't drop until there are several potential rivals that can be substituted for the brand-name version, he said. The FDA has also announced a May 13 public hearing about steps needed to bring more competition to the insulin market. As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, there has been some reluctance on the part of physicians and patients to switch to biosimilars. Although biosimilar insulins are cheaper than branded insulins, the prices have not yet been low enough to make changing products enticing in some cases. ""While the regulatory transition of insulin products nears, we're cognizant of the fact that it won't be soon enough for the millions of Americans who struggle to pay for their insulin today,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said in a statement. ""We all need to do our part. A drug that's nearly a century old should not have a list price that increases between 15% to 17% annually."" At the House hearing, Kasia Lipska, MD, MHS, of Yale-New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, spoke about her published research that found one in four insulin-treated patients surveyed at the Yale Diabetes Center rationed their insulin because of cost. Lipska told the House Energy &amp; Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations panel these results indicate the phenomenon of people skimping on insulin is common nationwide. And Rep. Raul Ruiz, MD, (D-CA) told his colleagues on the Energy and Commerce panel about having seen this phenomenon in both his own family and his own practice, as an emergency room physician. Patients who are not yet suffering ill effects or diabetes complications may be unwilling to pay for insulin, putting themselves at risk, he said. ""I've done talks about how this is the silent killer,"" Ruiz said. He explained how he has struggled to persuade his uncle, who has diabetes, to take adequate insulin. Ruiz said his uncle rebuffs the advice, saying he'd rather put his money toward buying groceries and filling his gas tank to get to work. In the ER, Ruiz said he saw people who had fallen into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic comas because of missing insulin doses, and he said he has treated people for pain caused by neuropathy and cardiac arrest. And through his work as a community activist, he has witnessed the struggles of people to come up with the money for insulin. He said he once encountered an elderly woman rummaging through trash. She told him she was looking for aluminum cans, for which she could collect rebates. The money she earned this way would pay for insulin. Ruiz said the woman tried to reassure him about her situation. ""'Don't worry, doctor,' she told me. 'Don't worry. I only take half a dose, so it can last,'"" Ruiz recalled. Ask the Tough Questions: Why Has the Price of Insulin Skyrocketed? Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-CA), who also has family members with diabetes, said lawmakers must act quickly to address the forces that are putting insulin beyond the reach of many Americans. ""Something is broken and people look to Congress"" to fix it, Barragán said, calling for a hearing with representatives of PBMs and insulin makers as witnesses. ""I want us to ask the tough questions,"" she said. ""We've got to get down to why this is happening. Why is it that [the price of] insulin has skyrocketed?"" Barragán said Congress should also act to assuage public concerns about lawmakers' financial ties to drugmakers, noting that many Americans think Congress has failed to do much on drug prices because of the lobbying influence of drugmakers. The pharmaceutical industry has been a significant contributor for many years to congressional campaigns of both Democratic and Republican candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonprofit group based in Washington. ""We have to come together to show that we don't care about the lobby, we don't care about private industry in the sense that we are colluding with them, because sometimes the American people think that,"" she observed. Barragán seemed to have missed an earlier comment from DeGette, who said her panel will call executives from three insulin makers to appear at a hearing. She did not immediately name the companies whose representatives she has summoned. But, given her comment, it appears likely that she meant the three big insulin manufacturers, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk. At the hearing, DeGette asked permission to interrupt Barragán as the junior member of the committee argued for a need to call a hearing with drugmakers and PBMs. ""We're bringing them in next week,"" DeGette told Barragán, who replied ""Fantastic."" ""You're welcome,"" DeGette said. For more diabetes and endocrinology news, follow us on Twitter and on Facebook.",https://t.co/A1qt7IuebC,others
Flaxseed for Diabetes and Prediabetes,"Flaxseeds may be a beneficial dietary supplement for managing diabetes or prediabetes. More specifically, in helping reduce insulin resistance, improve cholesterol and decrease belly fat.Yes, although these tiny seeds may be small in size, research shows the health benefits of flaxseeds are fairly enormous!Read on to discover more about them.JUMP TO: What is flaxseed | Nutrition facts for flaxseed | How do flaxseeds improve health | Insulin resistance and blood sugar | Cholesterol | Prediabetes | How to use flaxseedWhat is Flaxseed?Flaxseeds (also known as linseeds) are small edible seeds derived from a flowering plant native to India and the Mediterranean, but it is now cultivated in North America and various other parts of the world as well.There are three flaxseed products that you may come across in your local grocery market or health food store: whole flaxseeds, ground flax (flaxseed meal), and flaxseed oil.Flaxseed oil often comes in capsule form and is a great way to consume omega-3 fatty acids, especially if you're vegetarian and can't stand the thought of fish oil.Whole flaxseeds may improve your digestion, but they aren't ideal since they pass through your gastrointestinal tract largely undigested, though they still do produce a gel-like fiber.However, if you want to reap the full benefits of flaxseeds then you'll want to get ground flaxseeds (flaxseed meal) – this is the seeds broken down into a dense powder, which makes the nutritional components much easier to digest and absorb.Nutrition Facts for FlaxseedHere's what you'll find in 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed:Calories: 37Fat: 3 gProtein: 1.3 gCarbohydrates: 2 gDietary fiber: 1.9 gOmega-3s (in the form of alpha-linoleic acid): 2,112 mgMagnesium: 10% RDAVitamin B1: 10% RDAManganese: 12% RDAWhen it comes to flaxseed oil supplements the amount of omega-3s will vary between brands. However, the following label for generic flaxseed oil shows that one capsule contains 700 mg of omega-3s in the form of alpha linoleic acid (ALA).It also contains some omega-6 and omega-9 fats, but compared to omega-3s, these are less important, as the typical Western diet is often greatly lacking in omega-3s.Taking a supplement may be the most convenient way to get your omega-3s, but consuming ground flax gives you the added bonus of more dietary fiber (1.9 g per tablespoon!), as well as the vitamins and minerals you won't get from a capsule.How Do Flaxseeds Improve Your Health?As you just read, flaxseeds are high in fiber. Flax fibers include both soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, the proportion of soluble to insoluble fiber varying between 20:80 and 40:60.Insoluble fiber helps improve digestion and prevent constipation, while soluble fiber helps in maintaining blood glucose levels and lowering blood cholesterol levels.In addition, the omega-3 fatty acids found in flaxseeds have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects inside the body, working to dampen systemic inflammation and scavenge free radicals that are associated with health conditions such as diabetes and prediabetes.The ALA in omega-3-rich flaxseed oil also has hypoglycemic (blood sugar lowering) and hypolipidemic (blood cholesterol lowering) effects.Insulin Resistance and Blood GlucoseThere is quite a substantial amount of research showing that flaxseeds can improve insulin resistance. This is great news since insulin resistance can be a major underlying problem faced by most people with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.A 2017 study found that mice with artificially induced insulin resistance experienced great improvements when given ALA-rich flaxseed oil.These insulin-sensitizing effects have also been seen in many human studies.One study administered daily doses of ALA to obese patients with insulin resistance for 8 weeks. The researchers reported that the patients had decreased insulin levels and lower levels of insulin resistance. The patients also experienced lower levels of inflammation and reductions in triglycerides.Another study found that flaxseed powder supplementation (10 g/day for 1 month) resulted in reduced fasting blood glucose (-19.7%) and A1C levels (-15.6%) among type 2 diabetics.A product called flaxseed gum has also been shown to lower fasting blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes, from 154 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l) to 136 mg/dl (7.6 mmol/l) over a three month period, a reduction of 18 mg/dl (1 mmol/l).Please pin, tweet or share; then keep on reading.Back to topCholesterol and LipidsResearch has shown that flaxseeds have a favorable effect on cholesterol and blood lipids in those who have elevated levels.In one study, people with type 2 diabetes who consumed 5 g of flaxseed gum every day experienced a significant drop in both total cholesterol (from 182 mg/dl to 163 mg/dl) and LDL cholesterol (110 mg/dl to 92 mg/dl).Other studies have found that supplementing 10 g/day of flaxseed powder produced reductions in total cholesterol (-14.3%), triglycerides (-17.5%), and LDL cholesterol (-21.8%) among people with type 2 diabetes.PreDiabetes Flax seeds are also a great supplement for anyone who is trying to treat their prediabetes naturally.A study on prediabetes found that supplementing with 13 g of ground flaxseed daily for 12 weeks resulted in decreased glucose and insulin levels, as well as improved insulin sensitivity.In people with metabolic syndrome, supplementing with 25 mL/ day of flaxseed oil was shown to reduce total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, along with decreasing blood pressure.In another study of people with metabolic syndrome people were given 30 g/ day of ground flaxseed alongside active lifestyle advice, central belly fat was reduced by 36% compared to just 13% in those only given active lifestyle advice. The flaxseed group also had a reduction in insulin resistance.How to Use FlaxseedNow that you're familiar with all the potential health benefits of flaxseeds, how can you incorporate them into your life?Flaxseed oil capsules are perfect for increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce body-wide inflammation. Another great use for capsules is to decrease hunger.If you're finding you're eating a substantial meal but not getting that feeling of satisfaction, try including 2 flaxseed capsules with at least two of your meals each day. Animal studies have shown that supplementing with ALA increases the satiety (fullness) hormone leptin by around 10%. And we've been using this method with clients and it does seem to work.Other than taking a flaxseed oil capsule, ground flaxseed can be used in baking or mixed into foods you already know and love! Here are a few ideas for enjoying flaxseeds in your diet:Ground flaxseeds pair well with other low carb flours in recipes for muffins, crackers, pie crusts, and breadsFlax can also be found in store bought products like low carb cereals, or add it to a homemade low carb nut muesli for added fiberA combination of ground flaxseed and water can replace eggs in a pinch while bakingMix ground flax into Greek yogurt for some added fiberAdd one to three tablespoons of ground flax to your favorite smoothie and blend wellFlaxseeds have ample health benefits and make a great addition to any diabetic diet!Please pin, tweet or share this info to help others – thanks!

Teaching Patients How to Use Inhaled Insulin,"Anne L. Peters, MD: Ever since I completed a research study using inhaled insulin, I found myself using it a lot more frequently. I realized that in doing this study, not only did I get used to it and how it worked in my patients, but I also developed a way to teach patients how to use it. I basically reduced the barriers to my using it, and now I use it often; therefore, I'm quite comfortable with it. I wanted to share that experience with you and also have you learn from Mark Harmel, my diabetes educator, who is so good at teaching patients how to use it that it works quite effectively. Inhaled insulin works as follows. You have a patient pick a dose; it comes in a cartridge of 4, 8, or 12 units. The patient takes the dose just before eating. The insulin works very fast and it also goes away pretty quickly. It helps the patient really catch that first postprandial rise. If the patient's glucose level is high after eating, they can take another puff to bring down that blood glucose level. It doesn't cause the stacking phenomenon that you get with injected insulin. When to Take It Inhaled insulin is really good at the start of a meal. It's also a great correction insulin. My patients will use it after a meal—1 to 2 hours later if they have high levels—or when they're running high. For example, if a patient is on a sensor and he sees that his levels have been high all afternoon, he can take a puff of the inhaled insulin and his glucose level will come back down without going too low. Inhaled insulin is an incredibly useful tool for my patients with diabetes. I use it in both type 1 individuals and people with type 2 diabetes who are on insulin. The way I start patients is by having them pick one meal—usually dinner. I'm not a big believer in having a patient switch entirely to a different way [of taking insulin]. Obviously, patients stay on their basal insulin and I usually have them get used to taking it before dinner. How Much to Take Many patients may be nervous at first and they often don't take enough. They say, ""Oh, I only need 4 units."" Well, that's not true in most cases; they'll need 8 or 12 units. I let them work up and then see the effects. It's easy for patients who are on a continuous glucose monitor to see the effect of the inhaled insulin and see if their blood sugar is subsequently high. Those who are self-monitoring blood glucose with finger sticks can test an hour or two after a meal to see if they need a correction. I'll start patients with taking it with one meal a day and then advance to more meals per day as they fit this into their routine. I see it as an exceedingly useful tool to add to what my patients already have for managing their diabetes. Some patients will use it often (for every meal), some patients use it for correction, and some patients use it for both. The key to getting a patient to use inhaled insulin comfortably is in the teaching. I'm going to have Mark give you a lesson on how to teach your patients the correct way to use inhaled insulin. Teaching Your Patients Mark Harmel, MPH: Thank you, Anne. When I get study participants or patients in the clinic, the first thing I do is a lung test. We have to check and see if their lungs are healthy enough to use inhaled insulin. We use this device that measures lung capacity to do the FEV1 test. There is a little cardboard tube that goes onto this device. The patient takes a deep breath and blows it out very quickly, and then we measure the reading on the front of the device. We put that into a CDC website calculator, and if their lung capacity is at 75% or more, they qualify to use inhaled insulin. Next, you have to teach the patient how to inhale. There is this inhaler that's about the size of a whistle. You pop it open, and there are individual cartridges that you insert into the inhaler. You can see that there's a little point on the tip of one of them, and the tub that holds the powdered insulin is at the bottom. The tub goes down, you fit the point on the cartridge to the point on the inside of the inhaler, and then you snap it closed. Once you close the inhaler, it's important to keep it level because the insulin will fall out if you tip it over. Take off the mouth guard, take a little sip of water, inhale smoothly and gently, hold it in your lungs for a few seconds, and then exhale. There's a video on the Afrezza website that worked wonders for some of my patients. We also have to teach patients how to take care of the insulin. Inside the package, there are two folded pieces of paper. One of them has the typical drug warnings that are in many of your medications. Another paper has some nice illustrated instructions. There is also the refrigeration page. Just like your liquid insulin, you have to keep it refrigerated. It could take a couple of days or a week before patients really get the hang of using inhaled insulin. Be conservative to start, and make sure that patients have their fast-acting glucose with them in case they use too much. They'll learn how to use it over time. Many people find that they really like inhaled insulin as an option. Some people shift to it completely for mealtime use and others only use it occasionally. Your patients will find what's right for them. Peters: Thank you very much for that, Mark. If you feel comfortable with this, take the time to teach your patients, and have them watch the appropriate videos. You can teach your patients to quickly become experts in using inhaled insulin. Hopefully, it can help improve their outcomes.",https://t.co/sdvcddIyOF,others
Key House oversight panel to investigate rising cost of insulin,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), chair of the House oversight panel that's currently investigating the rising cost of insulin, announced today that her committee will hold its first of two hearings on the skyrocketing cost of the drug next Tuesday, April 2, at 10:30 a.m. ET.DeGette made the announcement while speaking at a health care policy summit on Tuesday where she told the crowd that her panel will hold two formal hearings this month to determine what Congress can do to make the life-saving drug more accessible to the millions of Americans who rely on it to survive.""The insulin pricing issue is a microcosm of what's going on throughout the prescription drug area,"" DeGette said. ""This is a drug that's been around for nearly one hundred years but, for some reason, has more than doubled in price over the last decade. In holding these hearings, we want to know what's going on and what Congress can do to help bring down the cost of this drug for the millions of Americans who need it to survive.""More than seven million Americans rely on insulin to maintain their blood sugar, but the steadily increasing price of the drug – which has more than doubled in recent years – has made it unaffordable for some patients who are now forced to take drastic steps, such as rationing their medication, in order to survive.DeGette, who has long been a leading advocate for Americans with diabetes, serves not only as chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, but also as co-chair of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus.In her role as co-chair of the Diabetes Caucus, DeGette launched a bipartisan inquiry into the rising cost of insulin last year to determine what Congress could do to make it more affordable for consumers.That inquiry led DeGette to release a bipartisan report in November that contained several policy recommendations for Congress to focus on in trying to combat the rising price of the drug – including, increasing competition among drug manufacturers, creating a standardized system for consumers to appeal an insurer's decision to deny coverage, and allowing consumers to pay the same price that wholesalers and pharmacies pay for certain drugs.Earlier this year, just weeks after taking over as the new chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel, DeGette sent letters to the heads of Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi – the three top manufactures of insulin in the U.S. – asking them to explain the rapidly increasing cost of insulin and why they are not providing a more affordable treatment to patients in need.DeGette plans to use the responses she received from those three drug makers as the foundation for the upcoming hearings.Next Tuesday's hearing, which will begin at 10:30 a.m. EST, will take place in room 2322 of the Rayburn House Office Building. A full list of the witnesses who will be testifying at the hearing will be released later this week. While a date for the second hearing has not yet been confirmed, it will be in April.Copies of the letters DeGette sent to the three manufacturers of insulin are available here.A copy of the bipartisan report DeGette released in Nov. 2018 is available here.",https://t.co/KkzTTf7hvu,others
Insulin Signaling Failures in Brain Linked to Alzheimer's,"Summary: A new study reveals impaired insulin signaling in the brain negatively affects cognition, memory and learning. The findings shed light on why those with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.Source: Joslin Diabetes Center.Scientists continue to find evidence linking Type 2 diabetes with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia and the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. However, little is understood about the mechanism by which the two are connected.Now, researchers at Joslin Diabetes Center, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, have demonstrated that impaired insulin signaling in the brain negatively affects cognition, mood and metabolism, all components of Alzheimer's Disease.In the study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the researchers, developed a novel mouse model in which they blocked the expression in the brain of both insulin receptors and the closely-related insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) receptors to two regions critical for learning, memory and mood.""This was the first [study] where we've really been able to show that disrupting these two signaling pathways, even with no other defects, was enough to impair learning and memory,"" said C. Ronald Kahn, Chief Academic Officer at Joslin and the Mary K. Iacocca Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, senior author on the paper. ""Since these two receptors can partially compensate for one another, what we did that was critical was this combined insulin and IGF receptor knockout. However, it was also important to do it in specific regions, since if it was everywhere it might have impaired brain development. By knocking out both [receptors], we removed not only the primary way they work but the backup system that's already built in.""The researchers targeted their double knockouts in the hippocampus and the central amygdala, two areas of the brain known to plays roles in impaired cognition and metabolic control. Mice with both of these receptors knocked out had effects on both systems, including control of blood glucose, anxiety and depression, and declining cognition.In one experiment, researchers placed the insulin and IGF1 receptor-impaired mice in a maze to study if they could recognize newly introduced stimuli. First, they were allowed to familiarize themselves with the maze. Eventually, a new roadblock would be introduced. Instead of exploring this new object–a measure researchers use to determine if a subject recognizes novelty–the mouse continued through the maze as though nothing had changed.""These mice had defects in learning and memory, as well as metabolism, and that's what made this particularly interesting,"" says Dr. Kahn. ""We've seen metabolic defects in [some previous] experiments, and we've seen mood defects in others but this was the first one that had a memory and learning defect.""These defects mirror one of the many cognition impairments associated with Alzheimer's disease.People with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk than the general population for developing Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have shown that impairments in insulin and IGF1 pathways in general increase the risk of premature cognitive decline, dementia, depression and anxiety. They have also seen that abnormalities in these receptors are more common in the brains of subjects with both Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. The Joslin study was the first to focus experiments on targeted regions of the brain to more specifically determine cause-and-effect.Through their work, the researchers noted one potential mechanism for the cognitive effects in particular. They saw that the mice had impaired expression of a neurotransmitter receptor known as glutamate receptor 1, or GluA1. The reduction in this neurotransmitter receptor could affect the brain's ability to make important synaptic connections that send information to the various systems in the body. This impairment could be the reasons behind the altered mood and decline in cognition. Confirmation of the role of GluaA1 in both cognitive decline and metabolic problems needs to be further explored in future experiments.People with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk than the general population for developing Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have shown that impairments in insulin and IGF1 pathways in general increase the risk of premature cognitive decline, dementia, depression and anxiety. NeuroscienceNews.com image is in the public domain.The researchers will next study the differences in risk and disease progression when these knockout mice are bred with mice genetically prone to developing Alzheimer's.Researchers know that insulin resistance affects insulin receptors and IGF1 receptors in humans, causing them to experience some form of cognitive decline–albeit in a milder form than what was seen in the double knock out mice. Understanding the mechanisms behind this process could help doctors develop ways to intervene and potentially slow or stop the development of Alzheimer's disease.""With diabetes and obesity, there is resistance in these pathways and therefore, we think that this could be an important factor as to why people with Alzheimer's disease and diabetes have a faster accelerated course or have more Alzheimer's disease,"" says Dr. Kahn.About this neuroscience research articleFunding: This work was supported by the German Research Foundation.Source: Jeffrey Bright – Joslin Diabetes Center Publisher: Organized by NeuroscienceNews.com.

"Visiting Mexico, asking strangers: Diabetics scramble for costly insulin","Mike Lawson will never forget how he ended up in the hospital 12 years ago when he had to decide between making a $300 car payment or buying insulin. ""I made a stupid choice,"" said Lawson, an Oakland resident who has Type 1 diabetes. ""That month I chose to pay for my car payment and to ration insulin."" These days, the price of insulin skyrocketing, and he is stockpiling the drug. Through Twitter, Lawson recently connected with a stranger who said she had four leftover bottles after switching brands. The two exchanged messages and met near her San Francisco office. Letting insulin go to waste ""is almost like tossing gold,"" Lawson said. The price of three commonly used insulin products has increased substantially in recent years. From 2013 to 2019, the cost of NovoLog nearly doubled, going from $289 to $540 per carton, according to according to letters sent in February to drug manufacturers by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating insulin prices. Another common drug, Lantus, rose in price from $244 to $431, the committee said. (The drug's maker, Sanofi, says the numbers rose from $228 to $425 over that time period, but the amount paid to the company actually fell 25% after Sanofi paid rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.) A vial of Humalog, a third popular insulin drug, cost $35 in 2001 and by 2015 had risen to $234, according to the Senate committee. And so, worried about cost, diabetics such as Lawson are increasingly seeking new ways to get, give away or exchange insulin cheaply or for free. Some are using unofficial channels on the internet. Others are traveling to Mexico, where pharmacies sell some popular types of insulin for a fraction of their cost in the United States. Lawson, who now is able to get insulin for a moderate price through insurance even though he still seeks out extra, has also given away some of his insulin to local strangers in need, who find him through Twitter by searching hashtags like #T1D (Type 1 diabetes) and #insulin4all. For the roughly 1.5 million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, the amount of money patients spent on insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $240 to $475 a month, according to a January report from the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care data. And spending in 2017 continued to rise, experts said. ""The risk isn't only that people are being trapped in debt,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, tweeted last weekend. ""Americans have actually died from diabetic ketoacidosis because they had to ration or skip their doses. We need to rein in Big Pharma greed to save lives."" Many stories have emerged nationwide about people who, like Lawson, rationed or delayed buying insulin because they could not afford it, often leading to deadly and dangerous results. About 1 in 4 diabetes patients uses less insulin than prescribed because of costs, according to a 2018 Yale University study. ""It's not just anecdotal, this is relatively widespread,"" said the study co-author Dr. Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. ""There are lots of patients having difficulty affording their insulin."" But why is insulin, which is naturally produced by the pancreas and first discovered for medical use nearly a century ago, so expensive? The scientists who invented it in 1923 sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto for the purpose of making it accessible. But the way the drug is produced and delivered to the body has changed significantly since then. Insulin was initially isolated from animal pancreases, but today it is made by inserting the human insulin gene into bacteria, producing the insulin protein, and then purifying it. Insulin is derived from live organisms and put through a complex process to become a medicine — so it's hard for a competing drug company to make a generic version of it. A handful of drug manufacturers have essentially patented the processes for creating modern-day insulin products just enough to keep exclusive patents under their name, experts said. Only three drug companies sell insulin in the United States: Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk. ""Some of the insulins have dozens of patents on them even though the active ingredient patent has expired,"" said Jeannie Biniek, a health economist who co-wrote the Health Care Cost Institute report. ""There's a question of whether these additional patents are providing a justified return on the investment or, if at some point, they are just providing the company the opportunity to maintain a monopoly on the market."" And, as is the case with many prescription drugs, it's not clear how the ""list price"" of insulin — what a patient would have to pay out of pocket for it, if they do not have insurance — is determined because negotiations between drug companies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers about who pays what are considered proprietary. Drug companies say lowering the list price wouldn't necessarily lead to lower costs for consumers because part of the list price gets paid to pharmacy benefit managers. In recent weeks, amid growing pressure from Congress, the drug companies and some insurers have announced plans to make insulin more affordable. But they fall short of many consumers' expectations. Eli Lilly, which makes Humalog, announced in March it will offer a half-price version of the popular fast-acting insulin for $137 per vial, but has not said when it will be available. A Lilly spokesman said the company also offers a free hotline that consumers can call for information about out-of-pocket reductions at the pharmacy and clinics where donated insulin is available. In April, hours before Sanofi executives were set to testify before a congressional committee on rising insulin prices, the company announced it will sell its insulin products for a fixed price of $99 a month, for up to 10 vials or boxes of insulin pens, to patients paying with cash. Patients who have commercial health insurance are eligible for co-pay cards that may lower their out-of-pocket expenses, a Sanofi spokesman said. Last year, 246,000 people used the co-pay cards and paid nothing or $10 a month for their Sanofi insulin, he said. Sanofi also provides free insulin for low-income uninsured patients who make about $30,000 a year or less. Novo Nordisk has provided free insulin to tens of thousands of uninsured people with diabetes since 2003 and spends $200 million each year on co-pay assistance to patients with commercial health plans. ""We know how challenging it is for a growing number of Americans with diabetes to afford their medicines, including the ones we make,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesman said. ""As a company focused on improving the lives of people with diabetes, this is not acceptable."" Cigna and Express Scripts, which recently merged, announced that they would cap out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $25 a month for patients whose pharmacy plans are managed by Express Scripts. Up to 700,000 people who are on employer-sponsored plans are eligible to receive this benefit if their employer decides to opt in. ""I'm glad to see the mounting pressure and public outcry are having an impact in Lilly releasing this generic and Cigna capping spending, but that's not enough,"" said Lipska, of Yale. ""Those are Band-Aid solutions that don't resolve the underlying issue of very high prices for these insulins."" Indeed, the discount and savings programs aren't reaching everyone. Sabella Larkin of San Diego said she has had to buy insulin in Mexico three times — once in Tijuana and twice in Rosarito. The first time was several years ago, when she was a college student in Texas, while working full time at a tanning salon and struggling to pay her bills. Her insurance at the time wouldn't cover an insulin refill until a certain date, and she couldn't wait. One of her customers at the salon lent her $200 to buy an insulin pen. ""Two weeks later when I got paid, I tried to reimburse her and she said no,"" said Larkin, 28. ""Being in that situation, that's when I went to Mexico and happened to see the insulin I take. It was only $20. I literally cried."" Larkin said she has purchased both NovoLog and Lantus in Mexico for $20 to $25, for the same amount of insulin that would have cost her hundreds of dollars at U.S. pharmacies. ""It was life changing,"" she said. ""It was this added security across the border."" Catherine Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Milton Alvis's answer to What is insulin resistance?,"Insulin resistance, crucial to lifelong health, means cells which used to respond to insulin and Amylin (especially liver and muscle cells) no longer respond as well.A huge range of variance in response exists, very high responsiveness is optimally healthy; reduced responsiveness is always characteristic of advanced disease.Why would this happen?Answer: The cells would become sick and die if they responded to insulin as well as previously; when healthier.What does insulin do?Answer: It is one of two small protein signaling proteins (the other is amylin) produced by the Beta cells of the Islets of Langerhans within the pancreas, always released in a fixed ratio, under both local and especially brain control (many specifics still poorly understood), that induce responses in other cells to lower glucose concentrations [optimal average of 100 mg/dL (HbA1C=5.0%, or lower) from human observational studies without treatments, despite many medical disease industry references which indicate higher is OK] in body water.Do either insulin or amylin directly reduce glucose concentrations?They are only endocrine hormones which (like all endocrine hormones) which may alter the activity of other cells.What is the response of cells which express insulin receptors on their outer cell membrane?Answer: These receptors relay the momentary insulin binding from their external receptor to internal cell signaling pathways which MAY result in internal membranes containing glucose transporter proteins being moved and fused into the outer cell membrane elsewhere (from the insulin receptor) on the surface of the cell. The glucose transporter proteins allow glucose to move from the water outside the cell into the water inside the cell. Without glucose transporter proteins within the outer cell membrane, glucose and other charged molecules will NOT pass through the two layers of fat molecules (phopholipid and cholesterol) of which all animal cells are primarily constructed, called a lipid bilayer, i.e. all cell are microscopic fat organized water droplets and all life on the planet is based on fat organized water droplets.Why would a cell which, when very healthy, expresses insulin receptors on its outer fat membrane no longer either express as many insulin receptors or insulin receptor binding no longer result on glucose transporter proteins being moved into the outer lipid bilayer?Answer: Because it is already overloaded with glucose: more than it needs, can burn or store as glycogen.What would induce cells to become insulin resistant?Answer: The unhealthy sugar overload inducing Low Fat Diet, as promoted by Ancel Keys and George McGovern, versus Nutritional Ketosis, long verified to be vastly healthier for humans, a fundamental adaptation which allowed humans to develop a larger, more energy intensive, critical for survival organ, the human brain.What is the most effective fuel for brain cells? Answer: Sugar or Fat? Definitely Fat! Yet the brain has little access to fat if the body owner keeps choosing low fat foods.Do these same issues apply to a huge number of other common human disease which have greatly increased over the last half century on the Western diet? Answer: Absolutely!Then why has the US Gov, USDA, NIH, AHA, ADA, Big Food and the medical disease industry long promoted, indeed still largely do? Answer: (You can likely figure this one out for yourself with some accuracy.)I would suggest study some of the work of Stephen Phinney, an MD and PhD, a researcher who has long studied these issues, along with a huge number or other online resources such as DietDoctor, Low Carb Down Under, etc.I hope this helped.",https://t.co/YU96ZyboED,others
"Impact of a 6-week non-energy-restricted ketogenic diet on physical fitness, body composition and biochemical parameters in healthy adults.","BACKGROUND: The ketogenic diet (KD) is a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat and adequate-protein diet that without limiting calories induces different metabolic adaptations, eg, increased levels of circulating ketone bodies and a shift to lipid metabolism. Our objective was to assess the impact of a 6-week non-energy-restricted KD in healthy adults beyond cohorts of athletes on physical performance, body composition, and blood parameters.METHODS: Our single arm, before-and-after comparison study consisted of a 6-week KD with a previous preparation period including detailed instructions during classes and individual counselling by a dietitian. Compliance with the dietary regimen was monitored by measuring urinary ketones daily, and 7-day food records. All tests were performed after an overnight fast: cardiopulmonary exercise testing via cycle sprioergometry, blood samples, body composition, indirect calorimetry, handgrip strength, and questionnaires addressing complaints and physical sensations.RESULTS: Forty-two subjects aged 37 ± 12 years with a BMI of 23.9 ± 3.1 kg/m2 completed the study. Urinary ketosis was detectable on 97% of the days, revealing very good compliance with the KD. Mean energy intake during the study did not change from the habitual diet and 71.6, 20.9, and 7.7% of total energy intake were from fat, protein, and carbohydrates, respectively. Weight loss was -2.0 ± 1.9 kg (P &lt; 0.001) with equal losses of fat-free and fat mass. VO2peak and peak power decreased from 2.55 ± 0.68 l/min to 2.49 ± 0.69 l/min by 2.4% (P = 0.023) and from 241 ± 57 W to 231 ± 57 W by 4.1% (P &lt; 0.001), respectively, whereas, handgrip strength rose slightly from 40.1 ± 8.8 to 41.0 ± 9.1 kg by 2.5% (P = 0.047). The blood lipids TG and HDL-C remained unchanged, whereas total cholesterol and LDL-C increased significantly by 4.7 and 10.7%, respectively. Glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 dropped significantly by 3.0, 22.2 and 20.2%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: We detected a mildly negative impact from this 6-week non-energy-restricted KD on physical performance (endurance capacity, peak power and faster exhaustion). Our findings lead us to assume that a KD does not impact physical fitness in a clinically relevant manner that would impair activities of daily living and aerobic training. However, a KD may be a matter of concern in competitive athletes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00009605, registered 08 January 2016.",https://t.co/HjbgC42jOp,others
Insulin Distress,"Abstract Diabetes distress (DD) is a commonly encountered adjustment disorder among persons living with diabetes. This article discusses insulindistress, a subtype of DD, which has distinct characteristics. Insulin distress can be defined as an emotional response to a suggestionto use insulin; characterized by extreme apprehension, discomfort, dejection, or denial; due to a perceived inability to cope with therequirements of insulin therapy. We describe the etiopathogenesis, clinical features and management of insulin distress. They highlight the clinicalchallenges that insulin distress poses in some persons. Pragmatic suggestions are shared regarding the addressing of insulin distress before orin parallel with insulin prescription.

While earlier authors defined DD as a set of unique, often hidden emotional burdens and worries that are part of the spectrum of patient experience when managing a severe, demanding chronic disease like diabetes,1 recent conceptualization views it as an emotional response characterized by extreme apprehension, discomfort or dejection, due to a perceived inability to cope with the challenges and demands of living with diabetes.2DD can be measured using validated scales, including the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS).3 Specific versions of DDS are available for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as parents of teens and partners of adults with type 1 diabetes. These scales help one assess the source of DD. The DDS documents four dimensions of distress. These are: emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress, and physician distress.4 The dimensions of DD in type 1 include powerlessness, management distress, hypoglycemia distress, negative social perceptions, eating distress, physician distress, and friends/family distress.5 Distress and insulin inertia Diabetes care providers are well aware of the barriers that prevent timely insulin initiation and intensification.6 The bridges that can overcome these barriers are also listed and classified in detail.7 The impact of clinical inertia on long-term outcomes is also well known, as are the advantages of timely insulin initiation and intensification.8 At times, however, the potential long-term advantages of insulin may be nullified by short-term diabetes ""distress."" Clinically evident distress in the patient may discourage diabetes care providers from discussing and prescribing biomedically apt therapeutic interventions. Insulin as a cause of diabetes distress One significant contributor to DD is insulin. Even the mere suggestion to initiate insulin is associated with a wide array of emotions among most people. These emotional responses range from innocuous apprehension to significant discomfort and even feelings of dejection, and are caused by a ""perceived inability"" to cope with the ""challenges and demands"" of using insulin. Also, it is not uncommon that these emotions are driven by underlying assumptions that are based on myths, rather than facts. However, more importantly, these emotions are real, and cannot be ignored. We therefore suggest that there is a need to address insulin distress as a separate entity.Insulin distress Insulin distress can be defined as an emotional response to the suggestion to use insulin, characterized by extreme apprehension, discomfort, dejection, or denial, due to a perceived inability to cope with the requirements of insulin therapy.Insulin distress is a construct based upon the biopsychosocial health model. Persons with diabetes may fear insulin for a variety of reasons. These concerns are perpetuated by a self-sustaining system of hearsay. The availability of easy communication tools, provided by modern technology, have facilitated the spread of such ""e-hearsay"".9 Etiopathogenesis The etiology of insulin distress may be biomedical, e.g., limited visual, tactile or motor dexterity. It may also be psychosocial in origin, such as fear of social ostracization or lack of financial support.10,11 While insulin distress is usually encountered before or during insulin initiation, it may occur at any time in the course of living with diabetes. Periods of poor glycemic control, poor symptom relief, suggestions for insulin intensification or change in preparation/delivery device may precipitate insulin distress. Distress may also occur in persons who are susceptible to negative reinforcement from friends, relatives, or practitioners of alternative medicine.Clinical course Insulin distress can present with a varied temporal profile and severity. While some persons may have ""acute"" or short-term distress, which resolves with counseling, others may experience subacute or chronic distress, which is refractory to diabetes education interventions. It is not uncommon to encounter ""relapses"" of insulin distress, precipitated by ill-informed relatives and friends, who counsel against insulin therapy.Insulin and diabetes distress—distinct entitiesWhile insulin distress is a part of DD, it is distinct and unique enough to warrant specific consideration. Insulin distress is spread over all domains of DD, as assessed by DDS type 1. Talk about insulin therapy may initially create a sense of powerlessness, and contribute to management distress. Concerns about hypoglycemia, negative social perceptions and restriction may be heightened with insulin use. Insulin conversations with physicians and friends/family may also lead to distress due to unfounded concern. While DD can accompany the lifelong journey of diabetes, insulin distress is usually episodic. Diabetes distress runs a chronic course, with peaks and troughs. On the other hand, insulin distress may be acute, subacute or chronic; monophasic or recurrent. Either may be precipitated by internal events (onset or worsening of complications), by changes in management strategy (frequency and intensity of diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions) or by psychosocial factors (suboptimal social or financial environment). Both of these types of distress respond to non-pharmacological measures, including strengthening of coping skills. While DD requires a generalized approach to management, insulin distress requires more specific and focused interventions.Disorders of adjustment The International Classification of Disease (ICD 10) by the World Health Organization (WHO) states that adjustment disorders are:""states of subjective distress and emotional disturbance, usually interfering with social functioning and performance, and arising in the period of adaptation to a significant life change or to the consequences of a stressful life event (including the presence or possibility of serious physical illness) […] Individual predisposition or vulnerability plays a greater role in the risk of occurrence and the shaping of the manifestations of adjustment disorders […] but it is nevertheless assumed that the condition would not have arisen without the stressor. The manifestations vary, and include depressed mood, anxiety, worry (or a mixture of these), a feeling of inability to cope, plan ahead, or continue in the present situation, and some degree of disability in the performance of daily routine"".12 This clinical picture suggests that insulin distress seems to meet the criteria of an adjustment disorder as specified in ICD 10.12The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) describes adjustment disorder as ""the presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s)."" In addition to exposure to one or more stressors, other DSM-5 criteria for adjustment disorder must be present:""The distress is out of proportion with expected reactions to the stressor and/or symptoms must be clinically significant leading to marked distress and impairment in functioning. The distress and impairment should be related to the stressor and are not an escalation of existing mental health disorders. Once the stressor is removed or the person has begun to adjust and cope, the symptoms must subside within six months"". These characteristics also suggest that insulin distress is a disorder of adjustment. However, six months may be an inappropriately long timeframe for assessing the adequacy of adjustment and coping with insulin.13 ManagementThe management of insulin distress takes significant cues from the management of DD.2 It is based upon four cardinal principles, namely, strengthening of self-care skills, optimization of coping skills, minimizing change-related discomfort, and utilization of external support. The umbrella term ""coping therapy"" can be used to encompass these principles. Insulin distress needs to be managed by addressing patient-related, physician-related and drug-related factors.7 Strengthening communication and coping skills, along with diabetes/insulin literacy, among all stakeholders, is a prerequisite to creating a sense of comfort with insulin. The clinical challenge, however, is in deciding whether to address insulin distress before prescribing insulin, or to postpone insulin initiation until distress is resolved (Figure 1).This planning is important, as it will set the stage for further diabetes care, and influence long-term outcomes. An in-depth understanding of both psychology and diabetology is needed to arrive at an appropriate decision. Take-home messages Keeping the aforementioned facts in mind, we suggest the following pragmatic and practical approach to this clinical situation:A thorough biomedical and psychosocial evaluation should precede and accompany discussion regarding insulin in persons with type 2 diabetes.Diabetes care providers must be aware of insulin distress, its etiology, clinical features, and management.Potential biomedical and psychosocial factors, which may limit insulin acceptance and adherence, must be explored and addressed. The need for insulin, and urgency of insulin prescription, should be balanced with the severity of insulin distress (see Figure 1B).In persons with life-threatening, organ-threatening, or limb-threatening illness for which insulin therapy is needed, insulin distress mitigation strategies should accompany insulin prescription.In persons with low or insignificant insulin distress, insulin therapy should be initiated as per clinical indications. Coping skills should be strengthened in parallel.In persons with significant insulin distress and no immediate threat to health, insulin distress should be addressed prior to starting insulin. Addressing of insulin distress may take one or more clinical interventions.A triage system, as proposed in Figure 1, may help prioritize between insulin initiation and insulin distress mitigation. Comfort level with insulin should be assessed and addressed if necessary, at every clinical encounter in persons using insulin.",https://t.co/Gf2T8Lpcs3,others

Around the world, the predominance of chronic, non-communicable diseases is expanding at an alarming rate. Confusions from Diabetes, for example, coronary corridor and fringe vascular malady, stroke, diabetic neuropathy, removals, renal disappointment, and visual deficiency are bringing about expanding inability, diminished future and tremendous wellbeing costs for essentially every general public. Diabetes is sure to be a standout amongst the most difficult medical issues in the 21st century. In this session, we are focusing on the complexity of Diabetes.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 2: Genetics of DiabeticsDiabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous group of disorders described by persistent hyperglycemia. Type 1 and type 2 both are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. In any case, there are other rare forms of diabetes that are directly inherited. These include maturity-onset diabetes and diabetes because of mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Within the following decade, the qualities that the genes that increase the risk of developing all forms of diabetes will likely be known. It is, in this way, important that researchers, wellbeing experts, health professionals, and members of the population at large consider how to maximize the advantages, and minimize the disadvantages of predictive genetic testing for diabetes.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 3: Nutrition &amp; DietNutrition and physical activity are essential parts of a healthy lifestyle when we have diabetes. Some foods raise blood glucose more than others. To deal with our blood glucose, we need to balance what we eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine if we take any. In recent years, there has been much new proof evidence demonstrating the potentially preventable nature of type 2 diabetes, especially by the implementation of lifestyle measures such as weight control and exercise. In perspective on this and the devastating health impact of the disease, it seems prudent that primary prevention should be a major priority. This session, concentrating on nutritional intervention in the prevention of type 2 diabetes is used to make disease-specific recommendations.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 4: Insulin MedicationsThe objectives of this session are to reduce morbidity and to prevent complications. Medications that reduce insulin resistance include thiazolidinedione and biguanides, which have anti-hyperglycemic effects and insulin-sensitizing. Vast amounts of insulin are additionally utilized in overcoming insulin resistance. Reaction to the normal dose of insulin is seen in occurrences in which the resistance is due to enhanced destruction at the subcutaneous injection site. Antiobesity drugs, for example, orlistat, may reduce insulin resistance and related cardiovascular risk factors through weight reduction and other mechanisms.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 5: Diabetes and Skin complicationsDiabetes can affect all aspects of the body, including the skin. Actually, such issues are sometimes the first sign that a person has diabetes. A variety of dermatologic indications have been connected with diabetes mellitus; these conditions fluctuate in seriousness and can be benign, deforming, and even life-threatening. Such skin changes can insight into patients' glycemic control and might be the first sign of metabolic derangement in undiagnosed patients with diabetes. Recognition and management of these conditions are imperative in maximizing the quality of life and in avoiding serious adverse effects in patients with diabetes.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 6: Obesity complication and ManagementObesity is the main source of preventable disease and passing in the world. In recent years, the number of overweight people in industrialized countries has expanded, altogether, to such an extent that the World Health Organization (WHO) has considered obesity an epidemic. In the United States, 69% of grown-up populace is overweight or obese. In Canada, the self-reported data demonstrate that 20% of men and 17% of women are obese and 40% of men and 27% of women are overweight. People who are obese are at a lot higher hazard for serious medical conditions, for example, heart attack, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, gallbladder disease, and different cancers than people who have a healthy weight.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 7: Diabetes PodiatryDue to the peripheral nerve dysfunction related to diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), patients have a reduced ability to feel torment. This implies minor wounds may remain undiscovered for quite a while. People with diabetes are likewise in danger of developing a diabetic foot ulcer. The research assesses that the lifetime occurrence of foot ulcers inside the diabetic community is around 15% and may move toward becoming as high as 25%. Those few patients are then 50% more likely to undergo another lower limb amputation. As such, diabetic foot care is one of the most essential parts of diabetes management and so we included this session at this wonderful gathering to discuss.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 8: Diabetes and Cardiovascular DiseasesDiabetes mellitus aggravates mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and heart failure. Unfortunately, these mechanisms are not sufficiently modulated by therapeutic strategies focusing solely on optimal glycemic control with currently accessible drugs or approaches. Women with diabetes have a considerably more serious danger of coronary illness compared to those of similar age who don't have diabetes. Actually, cardiovascular disease is by a long shot the most frequent reason for death in the two people with diabetes. Lamentably, in patients with diabetes, improvement in survival after a heart attack has been not exactly half as much as in the overall population. The main objective of this conference is to build open attention to early discovery and better treatment of diabetes to prevent its complications.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 9: Diabetes and CancerPeople with diabetes are at higher risk for some, but not all, forms of cancer. The relationship between the two diseases is complex and surrounded by unanswered questions. Diabetes is associated with increased risk for some cancers (liver, pancreas, endometrium, colon and rectum, breast, bladder). Diabetes is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. For some other cancer sites, there appears to be no association or the evidence is inconclusive.

A few medicinal plants have been researched for their medicinal use in various types of diabetes and have shown up in various scientific journals. The impacts of these plants may delay the advancement of diabetic difficulties and correct the metabolic irregularities using an abnormality using a variety of mechanisms. An impressive number of plants were exposed to clinical trials and were discovered effective. In addition, during the past few years, numerous phytoconstituents in charge of antidiabetic impacts have been separated from hypoglycaemic plants.Related Conferences: 3rd International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Healthcare, March 18-19, 2019, Las Vegas, USA | 2nd Global Experts Meeting on Diabetes, Hypertension &amp; Metabolic Syndrome, May 17-18, 2019, Singapore Atrium, Singapore | 2nd International Congress of Hypertension in Children and Adolescents, May 24-26, 2019, Warsaw, Poland | Diabetes and Endocrinology 2019, June 24-25, 2019 Rome, Italy | 18th Global Conference on Diabetes &amp; Nursing Care, June 27-28, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28th European Diabetes Congress, July 17-18, 2019, Edinburgh, Scotland | 31st International Conference on Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Diabetes, August 12-13, 2019, Tokyo, Japan | 12th International Conference on Diabetes &amp; Metabolism, September 18-19, 2019, San Francisco California, USARelated Societies: Estonia Diabetes Association | Bulgarian Diabetes Association | European Society of Endocrinology | FAND - Italian Association of Diabetics | Central European Diabetes Association | Franchise Association of Diabetics | German Diabetes Union | Spanish Diabetic Society | British Diabetes Association | Italian Association for the Defence of the Interests of Diabetics | Czech Diabetes Society | Albania Diabetes Association | Norwegian Diabetes Association | Swedish Diabetic Association | Albania Diabetes Association | Swiss Diabetes Association | Dutch Diabetes AssociationSession 16: Endocrinology and MetabolismThe endocrine issue is consistently astounding, including a mixed picture of hyposecretion and hypersecretion because of the information parts related to the endocrine system. For example, most kinds of hyperthyroidism are connected with an excess of thyroid hormone and a low dimension of thyroid animating hormone. Patients with multi-transfused thalassemia major may make serious endocrine complexities because of iron overload. Syndrome X is a term that is much of the time associated with the dissipates that exist together in various people with different sorts of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and furthermore diabetes in association with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and cell ionic abnormality.

The field of diabetes innovation to advance and in order for diabetes products containing novel advancements to be developed and used, these items will need to survive economically. Financial conditions and approaches of national different administrative bodies that control access to therapeutic advances must be positive in order for a patient in that country to have access to technology, and these arrangements are frequently extraordinary in every nation. Approximately 250 million people affected by diabetes around the world, diabetes is extracting an expanding toll from the world economy. People with diabetes acquire medical costs that are a few times higher than those without diabetes. Moreover, diabetes prompts critical aberrant expenses to the economy through early retirement and a disproportionate requirement for sick days and disability. As the U.S. populace becomes more established and fatter, it may be foreseen that diabetes predominance rates and future expenses of this sickness may develop at much quicker rates than would be extrapolated from current prevalence rates.

Klinefelter syndrome, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes: review of literature and clinical perspectives. Endocrine, 61(2), pp. 194–203.Abstract: Klinefelter syndrome (KS), the most frequent chromosomic abnormality in males, is associated with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The mechanisms involved in increasing risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality arenot completely understood. Insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes are more frequently diagnosed in KS than in the general population; however, the contribution of hypogonadism to metabolic derangement is highly controversial. Whether this dangerouscombination of risk factors fully explains the CVD burden of KS patients remains unclear. In addition, testosterone replacement therapy only exerts a marginal action on the CVD system. This review summaries the current understandings of the complex relationship between KS, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk in order to plan future studies and improve current strategies to reduce mortality in this high-risk population. Since fat accumulation and distribution seem to play a relevant role in triggering metabolic abnormalities, an early diagnosis and a tailored interventionstrategy with drugs aimed at targeting excessive visceral fat deposition appear necessary in patients with KS.Description: This is a post-peer-review, pre-copyedit version of an article published in Endocrine.

PCOS and insulin resistance,"What is the connection between PCOS and insulin resistance? What are the three criteria for PCOS, and why do some women develop too much testosterone? And why do patients put on a low-carb diet for other reasons than infertility, have a higher pregnancy rate?In this presentation from the Low Carb Denver 2019 conference, Drs. Nadia Pateguana and Jason Fung talks about PCOS and insulin resistance.This is our #10 published presentation from the Low Carb Denver conference. We've previously posted the presentations by Gary Taubes, Dr. Andreas Eenfeldt, Dr. Sarah Hallberg, Dr. David Ludwig, Dr. Ben Bikman, Dr. Paul Mason, Dr. Priyanka Wali, Dr. Caryn Zinn and Dr. Eric Westman.Transcript of the preview aboveDr. Jason Fung: Everything here is really a disease of too much insulin. And this is the part that sort of logic just breaks down. Because in medical school you learn about all this stuff and it's like okay well if too much insulin causes everything that you see in PCOS, then what's the treatment? How about Clomid? Is like… Did you not pay attention here? Too much insulin was the problem. Why are you giving Clomid which stimulates the ovary to ovulate? It's like… how about an ovarian wedge resection? It's like… What? What are you talking about? So ovarian wedge resection was this sort of old-time treatment for PCOS where they'd actually slice a little wedge, you know, like a little piece of watermelon out of your ovary and that was the treatment for PCOS. And why did it work? Because if you slice a little wedge of your ovary, your ovary cannot produce as much of the testosterone. So a lot of the symptoms would get better but, again, you're not making the actual disease better. Because you never actually treated the hyperinsulinemia. Or you can go to other treatments like… Metformin sort of makes little sense… But how about birth control pills? Is like, is that going to reduce your insulin? If it doesn't, then what are you doing for this disease?Like you got to go back to the root cause of the disease and fix it if you want to fix this disease. And the disease is so common and causes so much heart ache that– We treat it in this crazy manner when we already know what the root cause of this disease is. It's like it's too much insulin, so let's produce insulin.TranscriptWatch a part of our presentation above.

Targeted insulin-adherence intervention may improve glycemic control,"medwireNews: Targeting specific populations of individuals with type 2 diabetes for intensive interventions to optimize their insulin use may result in better glycemic control than an untargeted approach, findings from the TARGIT-Diabetes trial suggest.However, the pharmacist-led, telephone- and text-based intervention did not improve the primary outcome of insulin persistence, say Niteesh Choudhry, from Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, and co-investigators. The trial included 5596 participants with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin who were allocated to take part in a highly targeted high-intensity, partially targeted moderate-intensity, or untargeted low-intensity intervention.As reported in JAMA Network Open, the proportion of participants categorized as insulin nonpersistent – those who did not refill their basal insulin prescription within a set timeframe – was comparable among the highly, partially, and untargeted groups, at rates of 4.9%, 4.7%, and 5.4%, respectively.Nevertheless, patients given the highly targeted high-intensity intervention experienced a significantly greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels over an average follow-up of 287 days compared with those in the untargeted low-intensity group, with mean decreases of 0.31% versus 0.06%. Individuals given the partially targeted, moderate-intensity intervention had a comparable average reduction in HbA1c levels to those in the highly targeted group, at 0.21%.Glycemic control is ""ultimately a more meaningful outcome in diabetes care"" than insulin nonpersistence, say the TARGIT-Diabetes (Targeted Adherence Intervention to Reach Glycemic Control With Insulin Therapy for Patients With Diabetes) investigators. They add that ""[a]lthough the levels of glycemic control achieved were modest, the improvements were roughly equivalent to those anticipated from the addition of an oral hypoglycemic medication.""Choudhry and colleagues explain that their intervention targeted individuals most likely to benefit, so excluded people with very high insulin adherence, and assumed that those with very low adherence were likely to have ""completely stopped the therapy for clinically appropriate reasons.""Among participants who were randomly assigned to the highly targeted group, those with a predicted risk for insulin nonadherence of 20–80% and elevated HbA1c (≥8%) were given the high-intensity intervention, whereas those randomized to the partially targeted arm were given the moderate-intensity intervention if they had a predicted nonadherence risk of 10–90%. Patients in these groups who were not assigned to the interventions were given usual care. And all individuals allocated to the untargeted group received the low-intensity intervention.All interventions involved a tailored telephone- and text message-based program, with the frequency of follow-up calls ranging from two in the low-intensity group to as many as 12 in the high-intensity group.Taken together, the TARGIT-Diabetes results ""suggest that targeting patient populations for more intensive interventions based both on predicted risk of nonadherence and level of glycemic control has the potential to be more effective than untargeted approaches,"" conclude the researchers.By Claire BarnardmedwireNews is an independent medical news service provided by Springer Healthcare. © 2019 Springer Healthcare part of the Springer Nature groupSee also:",https://t.co/IjidShE20U,others
Aging is associated with myocardial insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction,"advanced age is associated with the development of whole body insulin resistance and increased incidence of type 2 diabetes in humans (4, 9, 14, 33). Aging is also frequently accompanied by obesity and inactivity that predispose to the development of insulin resistance (6, 16, 17, 32, 39). However, it is unclear what independent role aging plays in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in the absence of obesity and inactivity. Furthermore, it is unclear as to whether these abnormalities in insulin action extend to the senescent myocardium, where continuous contractile function makes inactivity less relevant.Recently, skeletal muscle insulin resistance in both advanced age (1, 28) and in lean offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes (10, 22, 29) was associated with altered mitochondrial protein expression (28) and density (10). These abnormalities were seen in association with increased intracellular lipid accumulation (22, 28, 29). However, it is unknown whether these same alterations are evident in the senescent myocardium, whether they are associated with altered insulin action, and whether they predispose to altered left ventricle (LV) hemodynamics in the absence of hyperglycemia or other conventional risk factors.Accordingly, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether aging alone was associated with both whole body and myocardial insulin resistance, independent of obesity and inactivity. A second goal was to determine whether myocardial insulin resistance is associated with LV, systemic, or coronary hemodynamic abnormalities. A third goal was to determine the cellular mechanisms responsible for myocardial insulin resistance with advanced age. Finally, we sought to determine the role of altered mitochondrial content and function in the pathogenesis of myocardial insulin resistance. We chose the model of senescent beagles as a well-characterized, large-animal model of aging. Specifically, senescent beagles have been utilized to investigate age-related alterations in myocardial contractility (10), coronary and ventricular remodeling (35), and response to exercise (11, 12) independent of the influence of atherosclerosis.METHODSAcclimationTwenty-four male dogs, all of which had a beagle background and weighed between 14 and 18 kg, were either classified as young (Y, aged 3–4 yr) or old (O, 10–12 yr) by the vendor. The veterinary staff confirmed the ages through dental examinations. The dogs were carefully screened for all disease known to occur commonly in canines bred for research by using laboratory and radiological studies. These included at least three samples for heart worms. In addition, at the time of euthanasia, a formal autopsy was performed to ascertain whether there were any clinically undetected diseases such as cancer.The animals were acclimated to the research laboratory for 6 wk before instrumentation. During the acclimation period, they were fed a standard chow once daily with a fixed carbohydrate and fat content. In addition, the dogs underwent a supervised exercise regimen on a treadmill each day for 30 min four times per week for 6 wk before surgery.InstrumentationAll dogs were instrumented as described previously by our laboratory (26, 27). The dogs were allowed to recover from the surgical procedure for 2 wk, during which time they were trained to lie quietly on the experimental table in a conscious, unrestrained state. Animals used in this study were maintained in accordance with the ""Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal Resources"" [DHHS Publication No. (NIH) 86–23, Revised 1996], and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Allegheny General Hospital.Experimental ProtocolHemodynamic measurements.Control experiments consisted of hemodynamic recordings to determine LV contractility (LV dP/dt), stroke volume, cardiac output, and coronary blood flow. Arterial (a) and coronary sinus (v) blood samples were obtained to calculate myocardial oxygen consumption (Mvo2) as the product of the left circumflex coronary artery blood flow and the myocardial arteriovenous O2 content difference.Metabolic determinations.Metabolic parameters were measured at 8 a.m., following an overnight fast. Transmyocardial substrate balance was calculated as the difference between arterial and coronary sinus content. Basal myocardial substrate uptake was calculated as the product of myocardial substrate balance and coronary blood flow (26, 27).The measurements of plasma norepinephrine, insulin, glucagon, adiponectin, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and glucose were carried out as described previously by our laboratory (26).In all dogs, whole body and myocardial insulin sensitivity were assessed in the baseline state by using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (26, 27). In the fasting state, a primed, constant infusion of insulin (480 pmol·m−2·min−1) was administered for 120 min to create a steady-state concentration of plasma insulin (∼1,000 pmol/l). Arterial glucose concentrations were measured every 5 min, and glucose was infused to maintain plasma glucose concentrations at 90 mg/dl ± 10%. Myocardial glucose and NEFA balance and coronary blood flow were sampled every 15 min to determine myocardial glucose and NEFA uptake.Cellular insulin signaling.Samples of LV myocardium and gracilis (skeletal) muscle from eight young and eight old dogs were obtained at the time of euthanasia under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (100 units regular insulin intravenously via the right atrial catheter). These samples were obtained within 2–3 h after the last hemodynamic measurements and clamp experiments were performed and when all parameters had returned to baseline. Briefly, under pentobarbital anesthesia, the chest was opened and the LV free wall was identified. Pledgeted stay sutures were placed, and a 5-g transmural section of LV free wall was excised, with hemostasis achieved by securing the sutures. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored to ensure hemodynamic stability. Simultaneously, another member of the team excised 5 g of gracilis muscle. Insulin was administered via the right atrial catheter, and after 2–4 min, a second sample of LV and gracilis muscle was excised before the entire heart was removed. Samples were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and were stored at −70°C. Purified sarcolemmal membranes were prepared by using sucrose-gradient centrifugation as described previously (34).LV myocardium was homogenized in a buffer free of phosphatase inhibitors and was subjected to electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE (19). Resolved proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) at a constant voltage (100 V) for 1–2 h at 4°C (37). Adjustments for protein loading were accomplished by normalizing bands on the basis of Coomassie staining of the blots (26).Polyclonal anti-insulin receptor-β subunit (IR-β) antibodies and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, monoclonal mouse anti-Akt-1, polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-Akt-1 (Ser473), and polyclonal rabbit anti-insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal anti-phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), polyclonal rabbit anti-glucose transporter GLUT4 and GLUT1 and protein A/G-PLUS agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal rabbit phospho-Akt-1 (Ser473) specificity was confirmed by using phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated NIH/3T3 cell extracts purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 followed by anti-phosphoserine (Ser307) Western blotting was performed with 200 μg of tissue lysate and was precleared with 0.05 μg normal rabbit IgG together with 20 μl of resuspended protein A/G PLUS-agarose by mixing for 2 h at 4°C. The immunocomplex was captured by adding 100 μl (25 μl packed beads) protein A/G-PLUS agarose and incubating at 4°C for at least 3 h. The supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed three times in ice-cold PBS followed by one wash with 0.5 M Tris·HCl, pH 6.8. Beads were resuspended in Laemmli buffer (19) and were boiled for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Data were expressed as the ratio of phosphoprotein to total protein. GLUT1 and GLUT4 translocation under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions was assessed by examining the ratio of membrane-associated GLUT4 to total (membrane and cytosolic) GLUT4. Sarcolemmal GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein levels were measured on purified membranes generated by using sucrose-gradient centrifugation as an established method for separating sarcolemmal from intracellular membrane components.The adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activity in the LV myocardium was determined as described previously (25). Activity was expressed as picomoles of incorporated ATP per milligram of protein per minute.Western blots to determine protein expression of components of the signaling pathway for fatty acid uptake [polyclonal rabbit fatty acid transporter (FAT)/CD36] and metabolism [polyclonal rabbit peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and PPARγ coactivator (PGC)-1α; Santa Cruz] were performed on cytosolic and purified preparations, respectively, by using methods described above.Mitochondrial isolation.Crude mitochondrial isolates were prepared from canine myocardium by using a trypsin-digestion procedure as described previously (26). The purity of the mitochondrial isolates was established by demonstrating the absence of Na+-K+-ATPase activity in mitochondrial preparations. The isolated mitochondrial samples from LV myocardium and gracilis muscle were resuspended to a final protein concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in a buffer at a final concentration of 125 mM Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 5% (vol/vol) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% (wt/vol) bromphenol blue. Membrane samples [5 μg/lane for uncoupling protein (UCP-3) and 2.5 μg/lane for succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase-1 (MCO1)] were subjected to electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE (24). Proteins resolved were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P) at a constant voltage (100 V) for 2 h at 4°C (37). Nonspecific membrane protein-binding sites were blocked for at least 1 h with 5% (wt/vol) dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (TTBS), and then membranes were probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-UCP-3 antibody (1:10,000; Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX), monoclonal mouse anti-SDHA antibody (1:100,000), or monoclonal mouse anti-MCO1 antibody (1:100,000; Abcam,Cambridge, MA), overnight at 4°C. The blots were washed three times in TTBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature in appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and then washed as before. The immunoreactive proteins were detected by use of an enhanced horseradish peroxidase/luminol chemiluminescence reaction kit (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and were exposed to X-ray film (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Densitometric analysis of the bands was carried out using a Personal Densitometer SI and ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Glycogen and fat staining.Samples of LV myocardium were fixed in formalin (2%) and were stained for glycogen content by using periodic acid-Schiff staining. Neutral lipid was identified by using osmium stain. Glycogen and fat content were quantified by using a MetaMorph imaging program and were expressed as volume percent myocardium.Transmission electron microscopy of myocardial and skeletal muscle.Tissue samples were placed in cold (4°C) 3% glutaraldehyde overnight. On the following day, samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 90 min, then dehydrated through graded ethanol and Acetonitrile. The sample was then infiltrated with one change of 50% propylene oxide, 50% epoxy resin for 2 h, and then pure epoxy resin for an additional 2 h before embedding. One-micron sections were cut and stained with methylene blue for light-microscopic examination. Thin sections were cut on a Reichert Om-U2 ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Philips CM-10 electron microscope at 60 kV.Statistical AnalysisData are expressed as the mean values ± SE. Differences in hemodynamic and metabolic responses between the groups were determined by two-way ANOVA. Where differences were detected over time, a post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test was performed to determine differences at respective time points. Differences in components of the insulin-signaling cascade, mitochondrial enzymes, intramyocardial lipids, and glycogen were compared by using a Student's t-test for unpaired data. A level of P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSThe Effects of Age on Body Mass Index and Metabolic ParametersTable 1 illustrates the effects of age on body mass index and metabolic parameters. There was no difference in body weight, body mass index, or abdominal girth between groups. Fasting plasma glucose levels were normal, whereas plasma insulin levels and NEFA levels were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in older dogs. There were no differences in plasma adiponectin or leptin levels. Notably, both plasma arterial norepinephrine and myocardial norepinephrine spillover were increased (P &lt; 0.01) in old dogs.Table 1.

There was a small increase in LV + septum weight, although the difference was not significant when normalized for body weight. There were no significant differences in LV systolic or end-diastolic pressures or LV dP/dt. Isovolumic relaxation was prolonged in older dogs compared with younger dogs. Older dogs had higher resting heart rates and mean arterial pressures but comparable cardiac outputs. However, there were significant reductions in LV stroke work and myocardial external efficiency in older dogs. Older dogs had higher basal coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption. LV dimensions were not different between groups (data not shown).Table 2.

Whole body glucose disposition was reduced in older dogs. These findings are consistent with impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposition. Figure 2 illustrates that that both basal and insulin-stimulated myocardial glucose uptake were reduced in older dogs, whereas basal myocardial NEFA uptake was increased. Hyperinsulinemia suppressed myocardial NEFA uptake and oxygen consumption to a greater extent in older dogs compared with younger dogs yet did not reduce Mvo2 to basal levels observed in the young dogs. Notably, the reduction in Mvo2 during the clamp was not associated with a significant change in heart rate or blood pressure, suggesting a relative shift in metabolic preference from NEFA to glucose.Fig. 1.Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in young (n = 12) vs. older (n = 12) dogs.

In cardiac muscle, there was decreased expression of insulin receptors and Akt protein abundance, whereas in skeletal muscle, there was increased Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 but no difference in insulin receptor or Akt protein expression. Notably, there was no difference in IRS-1 protein expression in either cardiac or skeletal muscle (data not shown). Figure 4 illustrates that there was diminished insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. This was seen in association with impaired GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin in both the skeletal and cardiac muscle from older dogs (Fig. 4). Although there was no age-related difference in basal cytosolic expression of GLUT1 [Y, 146 ± 23 density units (DU); O, 153 ± 47 DU], aging was associated with a marked decrease in sarcolemmal expression of GLUT1 (Y, 578 ± 46 DU; O, 233 ± 72 DU; P &lt; 0.01). GLUT1 translocation was not augmented by insulin administration.Fig. 3.Basal expression of proximal components of insulin-signaling cascade in cardiac and skeletal muscle from young (n = 8) and old (n-8) dogs.

There was no difference in AMPK activity between young and old dogs in either cardiac (Y, 3.24 ± 0.30 pmol ATP·mg−1·min−1; O, 3.11 ± 0.49 pmol ATP·mg−1·min−1) or skeletal muscle (Y, 2.12 ± 0.11 pmol ATP·mg−1·min−1; O, 2.01 ± 0.32 pmol ATP·mg−1·min−1). There was no increase in PGC-1α expression between groups in either cardiac (Y, 252 ± 23 DU; O, 264 ± 6 DU) or skeletal muscle (Y, 96 ± 10 DU; O, 86 ± 17 DU). There was no difference in PPARα expression in cardiac (Y, 425 ± 25 DU; O, 475 ± 116 DU) or skeletal (Y, 125 ± 25 DU; O, 75 ± 116 DU) muscle. However, FAT/CD36 expression in myocardial sarcolemmal membranes was significantly reduced in older dogs (Y, 1,312 ± 123 DU; O, 387 ± 12 DU; P &lt; 0.05), whereas there was no difference in skeletal muscle (Y, 212 ± 92 DU; O, 187 ± 54 DU).Figure 5 illustrates the effects of aging on myocardial mitochondrial structure and expression of mitochondrial proteins. There were no differences in the semiquantitative assessment of mitochondrial content in cardiac or skeletal muscle. The senescent myocardium was associated with increased vacuolization of mitochondria. These structural abnormalities were seen in association with decreased expression of UCP-3 in the senescent myocardium. In addition, MCO1 and SDHA were also diminished. These mitochondrial abnormalities were seen in association with increases in intramyocardial lipid deposition and decreased glycogen content (Fig. 6) in the senescent myocardium compared with younger dogs. In contrast, there was no difference in semiquantitative analysis of mitochondrial density or UCP-3, MCO1, or SDHA expression between young and old dogs in skeletal muscle samples (data not shown).Fig. 5.Transmission electron micrographs of myocardium from young (A, n = 7) and old dogs (B, n = 8). There was no difference in myocardial mitochondrial density, but there were decreases in mitochondrial protein expression including mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase-1 (MCOI), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3).

These abnormalities are seen in association with increases in plasma NEFA, increased myocardial NEFA uptake, and increases in myocardial oxygen consumption. Although both whole body and myocardial insulin resistance were observed in older dogs, there were distinct cellular abnormalities in insulin signaling in cardiac vs. skeletal muscle. Finally, myocardial insulin resistance is associated with altered mitochondrial structure seen in conjunction with decreased UCP-3 expression.Whereas total body insulin resistance has been documented frequently in advanced age (4, 9, 14, 33), the extent and mechanisms associated with myocardial insulin resistance in aging are unknown. We observed that myocardial insulin resistance was associated with impaired insulin-induced Akt-1 phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation but did not involve increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, as was observed in skeletal muscle in our study and has been reported previously (18, 40). In contrast, we observed decreased insulin-receptor and Akt expression in sarcolemmal membranes in senescent myocardium. Prior studies (36) have demonstrated a reduction in insulin-receptor density in senescent myocardium but have not examined altered Akt expression. Importantly, we observed increased PTEN expression in senescent myocardium but not skeletal muscle. Prior studies have identified PTEN as a putative mediator of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (21, 38) but not in myocardium. We have observed previously increased PTEN activity in the hearts of young dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy (26), suggesting that the mechanism of cellular insulin resistance may vary with the target tissue examined (cardiac vs. skeletal muscle).Altered myocardial insulin-mediated glucose uptake and impaired cellular insulin action were observed in association with increased basal NEFA uptake and myocardial oxygen consumption. These findings were seen in association with increased intramyocardial lipid accumulation and altered mitochondrial structure in the myocardium of senescent dogs. Notably, the increase in NEFA uptake and intramyocardial accumulation in the senescent myocardium occurred in the setting of reduced FAT/CD36 but unaltered levels of PPARα and PGC-1α. The mechanism responsible for increased NEFA uptake under circumstances of reduced FAT/CD36 remains to be determined. Prior studies have demonstrated reduced mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle of lean offspring of type 2 diabetes (10, 22, 29) as well as mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle of elderly subjects with insulin resistance (1, 28) in association with intracellular lipid accumulation. Recent evidence suggests that these findings are associated with reduced transcription factors such as PGC-1α (8, 20) or other cellular signaling pathways implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as AMPK (31, 41). We did not observe differences in AMPK activity or PGC-1α expression in the myocardium between young and old in the present study, suggesting that differences in mitochondrial biogenesis did not account for the observed differences in mitochondrial structure or protein expression.Altered mitochondrial structure and function has been identified frequently as a trigger to cellular aging (3, 13, 15) as well as insulin resistance (10, 22, 28, 29). Reduced UCP expression has been identified as a mediator of these events (15). We observed reduced UCP-3 content in mitochondria of older hearts in association with intramyocardial lipid accumulation. Recent evidence has suggested that these UCPs may be involved not only in mitigating the intramitochondrial accumulation of oxygen free radicals (15) through dissipation of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane but also in reverse transport of excess fatty acyl-CoA anion and peroxide from mitochondria (15, 29). Although UCPs and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in cellular aging (3), ours is the first evidence to implicate altered UCP-3 expression in myocardial insulin resistance in advanced age.Oxidative stress has been shown to lead to lipid peroxidation of mitochondrial membrane phospholipids, resulting in vacuolization of the mitochondria similar to that seen in our study (3). Although we cannot establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, the altered mitochondrial structure by electron microscopy decreased UCP-3, MCO1, and SDHA expression, coupled with the accumulation of intramyocardial fat, recapitulate a pathophysiological framework that has been established for insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (10, 22, 29) but extends the mechanism to the pathogenesis of myocardial insulin resistance. Together, these data suggest that normal aging is associated with both whole body and myocardial insulin resistance in the absence of significant obesity, physical inactivity, or contractile dysfunction. Notably, the cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance vary between skeletal muscle and myocardium as reflected in the distinct roles played by the increased expression of phospho-IRS-1 Ser307 and PTEN, respectively. In addition, there appear to be differences in the respective tissues in the nature and extent of mitochondrial structural changes with aging. Both mechanisms appear to be linked to increased intracellular lipid accumulation (25, 26).Despite the magnitude of whole body and myocardial insulin resistance and the nature and extent of mitochondrial structural alterations observed in these old dogs, the consequences to myocardial structure and function are modest at this stage. We observed modest but significant increases in resting heart rates and blood pressures and modest increases in LV mass, but not LV/body weight ratios, seen in association with increased plasma norepinephrine and cardiac norepinephrine spillover. There is an extensive literature linking chronic hyperinsulinemia associated with whole body insulin resistance to increased sympathetic nervous system activation (5, 7, 30), leading to hypertension. In this regard, there was significant impairment in isovolumic relaxation time, LV stroke work, and external mechanical efficiency. The impairment in cardiac external mechanical efficiency is interesting in light of excessive myocardial fatty acid uptake in older dogs under basal fasting conditions. The suppression of myocardial NEFA uptake and the associated reduction in Mvo2 observed during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in older dogs resulted in a significant improvement in external mechanical efficiency. The extent to which these age-related myocardial metabolic abnormalities predispose to altered systemic hemodynamics and LV function or predispose to increased consequences from superimposed cardiac injury remains to be determined.This is the first study to demonstrate the magnitude and the cellular basis of insulin resistance in myocardium from a relevant large-animal model of cardiovascular aging (10, 11, 12, 35). There are relatively few studies that have examined these metabolic derangements in senescent beagles or have looked at associated hemodynamic alterations with aging in this species. Prior studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated alterations in insulin-receptor autophosphorylation in obese rhesus macaques and impaired insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic aged rhesus macaques. Notably, we chose to control for the effects of obesity and activity level in our study to focus on the effects of aging per se. Similarly, we chose to study a model that does not develop coronary atherosclerosis in order not to confound the effects of aging per se. Nonetheless, there are several questions that remain to be elucidated. We did not measure lactate uptake during the hyperinsulinemic clamps, nor did we measure glucose or NEFA oxidation. We did not examine the effects of superimposed stress on the age-related responses. Such important inquiry will remain a subject for future investigations.GRANTSThis work has been supported in part by United States Public Health Service Grants AG-023125 and DA-104080.FOOTNOTESWe thank Teresa Hentosz for her assistance in the preparation of the manuscript.REFERENCES1 Barazzoni R.

Scientist story: Towards a cure,"Over the course of more than two decades, Jacob Sten Petersen has researched multiple chronic diseases, contributing to the approval of five licensed medicines in the process. But it was the unmet need of people living with type 1 diabetes, the less common form of the disease, that most struck a chord with the biochemist and Doctor of Medical Sciences who today oversees Novo Nordisk's stem cell research and development efforts.""The simple fact that people living with type 1 diabetes can never take a break from their disease has always particularly motivated me,"" explains Jacob. ""That's not to say that it is easy to live with other chronic diseases, but for these people, and particularly for children, their dependence on insulin therapy and the constant management of the disease is a significant burden that I've always been passionate about reducing.""Little did Jacob know it, but fate would see him personally experience the burden that had for so long been his primary source of motivation. In 2016, more than 20 years after he began researching a cure for type 1 diabetes, his three-year-old daughter Vita was diagnosed with the disease.""Vita's symptoms approached so quietly and unexpectedly that despite my medical training and line of work, it didn't initially occur to me that she could have diabetes,"" recalls Jacob. ""But the moment I first tested her blood glucose will stay with me forever. I knew there and then that Vita's life had in an instant become significantly more challenging. It was truly life changing."" Even for Jacob, a leading researcher, published author and frequent contributor to the world's leading diabetes conferences, the learning curve that accompanied the diagnosis of a child with type 1 diabetes was steep.""I felt that I knew a great deal about life with diabetes,"" explains Jacob. ""But in reality, I didn't truly understand what it is like to live with a chronic disease until Vita was diagnosed. We were faced with 100 decisions a day to help manage her blood glucose and to ensure her wellbeing. It really was an eye-opener for me.""Vita's diagnosis carried a heavy toll for Jacob and his family as they came to terms with it emotionally and recalibrated their daily lives to accommodate the management of her disease. But as the dust settled and the family adjusted to their new reality, Jacob's outlook evolved from one of sadness to one of positivity.""I came to realise that helping Vita to live with diabetes was a daily learning experience that was teaching me about the real needs of people living with the disease,"" reflects Jacob. ""My work had always been important, but it took on a whole new meaning. Vita's diagnosis put things in perspective and I became thankful for my skills and the fact that when I go to work, I'm able to strive towards a better future for my daughter and for people just like her.""The future that Jacob has in mind includes a cure for type 1 diabetes – something that he and his colleagues have been pursuing using stem cell therapy since 1998. Two decades of research and a partnership with Cornell University have led the team to a stage where they have demonstrated 'proof of concept'– curing diabetic rodents using encapsulated insulin-producing stem cells.""I am delighted that our efforts are finally beginning to bear fruit,"" says Jacob. ""There is still much work to be done, but we hope that we will be able to initiate the first clinical trial in humans within a few years.""As with the development of any novel treatment, pitfalls line the path to success and there are no guarantees of a positive outcome. But Jacob is hopeful and is able to begin to imagine a life for Vita in which she is free from the daily management of her diabetes.""Vita is six years old today,"" he says. ""If we can deliver on our research within 15 years, she could be cured of type 1 diabetes by the time she is 20.

In the USA, almost 1 million acute MIs occur each year2 with approximately 15% of patients dying as a result of their acute event.2 If one manages to survive an acute MI, depending on the age of onset, the average survival time ranges anywhere from just 3.2 years to up to 17 years.2 Thus, CHD and acute MI are leading causes of early mortality in the USA.2Asymptomatic hyperglycaemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CHD, as well as death from CHD.3 Hyperglycaemia can develop during an acute MI, even in patients without diabetes,3 which may be caused by an increase in catecholamines, a reduction in the release of insulin, development of insulin resistance and increases in cortisol and growth hormone.3–5 However, many patients with MI already have diabetes and simply have yet to be diagnosed (ie, latent diabetes), where the acute stress worsens their diabetic state leading to hyperglycaemia.3 Indeed, one study showed that 73% of patients presenting with an acute MI have abnormal glucose tolerance, with 50% having diabetes.6 After 6 months, 43% still had abnormal glucose tolerance, which is approximately threefold higher than that found in matched controls (15%), the difference between the two being significant.6 Thus, hyperglycaemia does not seem to be an acute or temporary finding in patients who have experienced an MI, with many of these patients having continued abnormal glucose tolerance even when followed for several years after their event.The Whitehall study, a prospective cohort study encompassing 18 403 patients, showed that blood glucose after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was related to the age-adjusted CHD mortality after 7.5 years.7 In non-diabetics, a 2-hour blood glucose at 96 mg/dL or higher was associated with a twofold increased risk of CHD mortality.7 An elevated insulin response to an oral glucose load has been found in patients with atherosclerosis of the peripheral, cerebral and coronary arteries.8 9 In the Busselton, Australia study, insulin levels 1 hour after ingesting a 50 g oral glucose load were significantly related to the 6-year CVD incidence and 12-year CVD mortality in men aged 60 and older.10 In both the Helsinki policeman study11 and the Paris civil servant study,12 insulin levels taken in the fasting state after an oral glucose load (75 or 90 g) were associated with the occurrence of MI and CHD death 5 years later in men aged 30–59. However, the insulin:glucose ratio had the closest association with CVD. In all three studies, the relationship of insulin with CVD was independent of other covariates, including lipids, blood pressure and blood sugar.13 Considering that refined sugar, even when compared with starch, has been found to raise serum insulin levels,14 15 this provides compelling evidence that overconsuming added sugars (sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup) may lead to an increased risk of CHD through raised insulin levels.The evidence incriminating insulin and carbohydrate in atherogenesis is strong, and that this scheme would link atherosclerosis with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipaemia, lack of physical exercise, and, possibly, hypertension.16 (Stout and Vallance-Owen)It has been known for over 50 years that people with hypercholesterolaemia and hyperlipaemia generally have abnormal carbohydrate metabolism, with an elevated insulin level often driving their hyperlipidaemia.17 Indeed, insulin has been found to increase lipogenesis18 and stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation.19–21 Hyperinsulinaemia is also an independent risk factor for CHD,10 11 and insulin resistance predicts future cardiovascular risk.22 23 Increased levels of insulin are found in multiple disease states, including obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and those with hypertriglyceridaemia.24 Thus, any dietary factor that worsens glucose tolerance or promotes insulin resistance will also likely increase the risk of acute MI, CHD and CHD mortality. Considering that a diet high in added sugars (particularly the fructose component) leads to insulin resistance,25–28 the overconsumption of added sugars is undoubtedly a contributing factor to CHD and CVD mortality. Indeed, compared with a diet that contains less than 10% of calories from added sugars, a diet containing 25% or more calories from added sugars nearly triples the risk for CVD mortality.29Data from animal and human studies have noted that the isocaloric replacement of starch, glucose or a combination of both, with sucrose or fructose, increases fasting insulin levels,14 15 reduces insulin sensitivity,25–27 increases fasting glucose concentrations,30 increases glucose and insulin responses to a sucrose load14 15 and reduces cellular insulin binding.25 In other words, calorie for calorie, consuming added sugars is more harmful than starch or glucose regarding worsening of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Additionally, feeding rats sucrose leads to impaired glucose tolerance31 and adipose tissue that is less sensitive to the effects of insulin.32 33 Thus, data from animals and humans indicate that overconsuming added sugars drives insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia.During an acute MI, the heart switches from primarily using fatty acids as energy to using glucose. As insulin facilitates glucose uptake into cells, patients with insulin resistance during an acute MI will have a worse prognosis. Indeed, the degree of insulin resistance is related to the severity of an MI,34 and after an MI diabetics are more likely to die compared with non-diabetics.35 A diet high in added sugars promotes insulin resistance and diabetes,14 15 28 36 37 and thus may lead to larger MIs and increase the risk of CHD mortality.It is well known that those with diabetes have a higher risk of mortality and MI versus those without diabetes,38 which is independent of smoking status, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and body fat distribution. Additionally, patients diagnosed as being newly diabetic also have an increased risk of MI. Diabetics also have more coronary atherosclerosis than non-diabetics,39 40 particularly a higher frequency of severe narrowing of the left main coronary artery and healed transmural ventricular scars.41 The Framingham study showed that those with diabetes have an approximate threefold increased risk of dying from CVD versus the general population as well as an increased risk of stroke, CHD and peripheral arterial disease.42 Higher blood pressure or higher lipoproteins did not account entirely for the increased incidence of CHD among diabetics.13A diet high in added sugars has been shown to increase the prevalence of diabetes, whereas a lower intake has the opposite effect.43–46 Thus, added sugars promote an increased risk of CHD by increasing the risk of diabetes, which has been shown in both ecological analyses as well as clinical trial data. Considering that added sugars also promote insulin resistance, and those who experience an acute MI are more likely to be insulin resistant, the overconsumption of added sugars drives CHD.25 27A raised cholesterol level is not the only risk factor in those with CHD. Indeed, many other abnormalities commonly occur such as elevated glucose, insulin, triglycerides, uric acid and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.47 Additionally, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and altered platelet function are commonly found in patients with CHD or those with risk factors for CHD.48–51 All of these CHD abnormalities are induced or worsened in humans and animals when given a diet high in sugar,52–55 which can be reversed when reverting back to a diet low in sugar.14 55 This provides compelling evidence that the overconsumption of added sugars is a principal driver of CHD.Administration of a diet high in sugar for just a few weeks leads to approximately one-third of men experiencing numerous changes seen in CHD and peripheral vascular disease.53 54 These suggest that the overconsumption of sugar and the subsequent insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinaemia drive CHD as well as other diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and gout.56 57 Interestingly, smoking, which is a risk factor for heart disease, has been found to induce hyperinsulinism,58 suggesting that both the overconsumption of added sugars and smoking predispose to heart disease in a similar manner (via hyperinsulinaemia; although both also induce inflammation, oxidative stress and increased platelet adhesiveness).59–61Over the past 200 years, the average intake of added sugars has increased from 4 to 120 lb/year.62 Sugar is even more rewarding than cocaine in animal studies, and in humans added sugar is arguably the most widely consumed addictive substance around the world.63 The fact that diabetics have an increased risk of occlusive arterial disease,24 and that non-diabetic patients with vascular disease have raised insulin levels,24 suggests that insulin resistance is at the centre of heart disease. Considering a diet high in added sugars can induce insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia in humans, and a reduction in added sugars can improve these metabolic derangements, there is compelling evidence that the overconsumption of added sugars (high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose) is a principal driver of CHD. Indeed, refined sugar, as compared with fat, starch, glucose, or a combination of starch and glucose, promotes greater detriments on glucose and insulin levels in humans.14 15 28 36 37Currently, the main dietary culprit thought to lead to CHD is saturated fat. However, the overconsumption of added sugars (sucrose or table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) has also been associated with an increased risk of CVD and mortality from cardiovascular causes. A diet high in added sugars for just a few weeks has been found to produce numerous abnormalities found in patients with CHD including elevated insulin levels and insulin resistance. More importantly, a diet low in added sugars and refined carbohydrates has been found to reverse all of these metabolic defects. The evidence indicates that added sugars are a likely dietary culprit leading to CHD.",https://t.co/ctwgx3AFxP,others
"House Lawmakers Grill Drugmakers, PBMs on Insulin Cost","Members of the US House of Representatives on Wednesday expressed clear disbelief and growing frustration with the explanations for high insulin prices charged by drugmakers and pharmaceutical middlemen. At a hearing held by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD) challenged arguments presented by pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs), who said secrecy in negotiations ultimately helps lower drug prices for consumers. More transparency about the flow of money in the pharmaceutical supply chain thus would result in higher drug prices for consumers, according to witnesses from the PBMs. ""I don't buy it. I'm not buying it. I think a system has been built that allows for gaming to go on,"" Sarbanes told the hearing's six witnesses, who were executives representing drugmakers and PBMs. ""The system is working for both of you at the expense of the patient."" About 7.4 million people in the United States take insulin, according to a report by the American Diabetes Association. Lawmakers frequently hear stories from their constituents about what happens when people face high insulin costs, with some not paying other bills in order to buy the drug, said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), chair of the Oversight and Investigations panel of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Other patients report having to ration doses or skip insulin altogether, she said. ""It is simply unacceptable that anyone in this country cannot access the drug their very lives depend on,"" DeGette said. ""All because the price of this drug — a drug that is nearly 100 years old — has gotten out of control."" Although the estimated manufacturing cost of most forms of insulins ranges from $2.28 to $6.34 per vial, consumers may pay more than $400 per month for the drug, the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a memo for the Wednesday hearing held by DeGette's subcommittee. The Oversight and Investigations subcommittee also heard from diabetes experts last week about the struggles of patients to afford insulin, a drug first brought to the US market in 1923. Insulin has been modified over the years into forms that are more convenient for patients to use, such as the long-acting glargine (Lantus SoloStar, Sanofi). Yet lawmakers on Wednesday noted even these more advanced products have been on the market for many years, making the continual price increases a surprise. Medicare has reported, for example, that its Part D plans saw a 9.8% increase in annual growth rate for average spending per dose of Lantus Solostar between 2013 and 2017. The high cost of insulin is helping erode consumers' faith in the free market approach to pharmaceutical pricing, said House Energy and Commerce Chair Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ). Although he still favors this method, many of his constituents do not, Pallone said. ""What they tell me is 'Just set the price.' They'll literally say to me, 'You in Congress or some government agency should just set the price and that's it,'"" Pallone said at the hearing. ""They just don't believe in the competitive model anymore."" The comment from Pallone was striking, given the location of his district on the edge of the historical American cradle of the pharmaceutical industry. Pallone's New Brunswick, New Jersey, district office is a few blocks from Johnson &amp; Johnson's headquarters. It's also within about 40 miles of major offices of Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Novartis. And within about 20 miles of Pallone's New Brunswick office are the US headquarters of two insulin makers whose executives attended the Wednesday hearing: Novo Nordisk, with US operations based in Plainsboro, New Jersey, and Sanofi, in Bridgewater. While addressing questions from Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA), Kathleen W. Tregoning, Sanofi's executive vice president of external affairs noted her company on Wednesday had unveiled an expansion of its insulin savings program. Launched a year ago, Sanofi's program initially allowed customers who pay cash to pay the set prices of $99 for one 10-mL vial or $149 for a box of pens. The program now will allow them to purchase as much as 10 boxes of pens and/or 10-mL vials for $99 per month, Sanofi said in a statement. Kennedy questioned what he seemed to see as convenient timing of this expansion, observing to Tregoning that the change had been ""announced today when you are in front of Congress."" Like many members of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, Kennedy expressed frustration about the seemingly endless loop of PBMs blaming insulin makers for high costs and the pharmaceutical companies, in turn, blaming the benefit managers. ""If you are in my position, what do we do to try to make sure that the patients in this country get access to life-saving medication?"" for which initial rights were sold for about $1, Kennedy said, referring to the price those who discovered insulin charged the University of Toronto for the patent. Separately, Senate Finance Chair Charles E. Grassley (R-IA) said in a statement Wednesday that Sanofi's move, and a similar announcement from Cigna last week, raise many questions. ""Why was Sanofi charging so much more before this announcement? What took them so long to offer the price reduction?"" Grassley said. ""It shouldn't take months of bad press, persistent public outcry, and increasing congressional scrutiny to get a company to charge a fair price. That's not how a functioning marketplace works."" ""Prescription drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers should take very seriously their responsibility to patients and taxpayers,"" Grassley added. ""Right now, they're not. And that's a status quo that's not going to last."" Grassley and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, are in the midst of their own investigation of insulin prices. Grassley and Wyden on Wednesday also said they had asked the Inspector General of Health and Human Services (HHS) for an analysis of PBM's business practices, specifically regarding certain pricing in Medicaid. In the House, DeGette, as chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, and Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, the panel's ranking Republican, are spearheading their chamber's examination of high insulin prices and conducting their own investigation. Smoke-and-Mirrors System After DeGette and colleagues grilled representatives of drugmakers and PBMs for several hours on Wednesday, she said she may call them back in June or September to update the subcommittee on their progress on their efforts to lower insulin costs. ""This is not optional and it is going to happen,"" DeGette told the witnesses. In her view, a ""smoke-and-mirrors"" system is triggering continual increases in the list prices for insulin, so that PBMs can then negotiate to somehow bring the price back down. She cited as an example insulin lispro (Humalog, Eli Lilly), a drug used by her daughter, Francesca, who has type 1 diabetes. The price has risen from about $35 a vial in 2001 to $275, DeGette said. ""The generic Humalog that Lilly has come up with, good news, it's only $137 a bottle. So it's still way beyond where it was in 2001,"" DeGette said. Appearing as witnesses at the hearing, representatives of Cigna's Express Scripts, UnitedHealth's Optum, and CVS maintained that drugmakers are responsible for setting high list prices. Thomas M. Moriarty, executive vice president, chief policy and external affairs officer for CVS, said list prices for insulin have increased nearly 50% in the last 3 years alone. ""Over the last 10 years, the list price of one product, Lantus, rose by 184%,"" Moriarty said. ""The primary challenge we face is that unlike most other therapeutic classes, until recently, there have been no generic alternatives available."" Drugmakers have maintained that PBMs actually encourage them to raise list prices, putting their firms at risk of losing business if they dropped the cost of their insulin. They also said the list prices may provide a deceptive view of their potential profit from medicines, with rebate money flowing to insurers and PBMs. In written testimony, Michael B. Mason, Lilly's senior vice president for Connected Care and Insulins, included a chart that showed Lilly's net price for its most widely used insulin product, Humalog U100, dropping even as its list price spiked. The average list price rose from $391 in 2014 to $594 in 2018, a gain of more than 50%, according to Lilly's chart. Yet, the average net price that Lilly realized from these sales slipped from $147 in 2014 to $135 in 2018, a decline of about 8.2%. In addition, Humalog ""is essentially free to Medicaid programs,"" as Lilly pays a rebate of about 100%, Mason said, noting the expansion of the health program as a result of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The number of people enrolled in Medicaid increased from 54.5 million in 2010 to 73.4 million in 2017. ""Providing insulin to this population at little or no cost is a significant step towards ensuring affordable access for those in need,"" Mason said. Lawmakers have introduced a number of bills intended to foster greater transparency about drug prices and speed generic competition for medicines. It's unclear how much of this proposed legislation will be enacted, with drugmakers in opposition to some proposed changes. PBMs face perhaps a more immediate commercial threat from an HHS proposal. In January, HHS Secretary Alex Azar proposed an overhaul of how PBMs get paid for Medicare and Medicaid transactions. Azar said he intends to address what he calls a ""perverse incentive"" with rebates, in that PBMs stand to profit more if pharmaceutical companies set higher list prices. Azar is seeking to amend federal rules, originally meant to prevent patient harm from industry kickbacks, to reroute the flow of discounts. He's seeking to have these savings on drugs flow more directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. HHS is seeking to create new fixed fee services arrangements between drugmakers and PBMs. The proposal has split industry groups, with the trade group for drugmakers, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), supporting the move and the trade group for PBMs, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), criticizing it. In their testimony during the Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, PBMs noted that HHS's own proposed rule includes analyses that suggest it would raise premiums for consumers. The actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that Part D premiums will increase by as much as 25% and federal spending will increase by $196 billion over 10 years, said Amy Bricker, RPh, senior vice president of the supply chain of Express Scripts in her testimony. Still, lawmakers appeared skeptical about how well the rebate system benefits consumers. At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) suggested simply dropping the rebates and moving to a system in which PBMs would get a flat fee for serving as go-betweens. He questioned what justifies cases where PBMs base their fees on list prices for medicines. ""It doesn't cost your company any more to process a $4 drug than it does a $40,000 drug,"" Griffith said. ""Wouldn't it make more sense just to have a flat fee for doing what y'all do?"" Rep. Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter (R-GA) said concerns about the business practices of PBMs and drugmakers have sparked rare unity among Democrats and Republicans in Congress. ""What you've witnessed here today is bipartisanship,"" Carter, who owns community pharmacies, told the witnesses. He predicted that HHS would prevail in its efforts to overhaul the drug rebate system, particularly efforts to apply discounts at the point of sale. ""That's going to happen. We're going to make sure that happens,"" Carter said. ""That's going to bring more transparency to the system and we're not going to stop there.""

"Postprandial insulin assay as the earliest biomarker for diagnosing pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk","Kraft patternsHyperinsulinaemia is thought to be aetiological in hypertension, obesity, atherosclerosis, microvascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, idiopathic peripheral neuropathy and certain cancers,4 5 and is associated with idiopathic tinnitus, vertigo and hearing loss.6 A key research paper published in 1975 by Dr Joseph R Kraft comprised 3650 patients who were randomly referred for glucose tolerance testing.7 Dr Kraft described five different insulin patterns in response to a 100 g glucose load administered over 3–5 hours with insulin levels assessed at baseline, 30, 60, 120, and at minimum, 180 min. Further 240 and 300 min insulin levels were also considered in certain instances. Pattern I was labelled as the normal insulin tolerance, where the fasting insulin levels were between 0 and 30 microunits, with peak insulin production demonstrated on 30 or 60 min levels, followed by return to fasting range at 120 or 180 min, and stabilised on fasting levels beyond 180 min. Pattern II accounted for those with normal insulin peak but delayed return to baseline fasting levels, and pattern III consisted of subjects with delayed insulin peak appearing later than 60 min. Pattern IV was labelled in cases who had baseline fasting levels more than 50 microunits. The last pattern, pattern V, had patients with insulin levels of less than 30 microunits at all times.7These insulin/glucose tolerance tests were then compared with standard glucose tolerance tests. A score of 0 Wilkerson point was labelled as normal, ½, 1 and 1 ½ as equivocal, and 2 or 3 as diagnostic for diabetes. In this research by Kraft, 47% had normal glucose tolerance, 34% had equivocal results and 19% were positive for diabetes. The assessment of insulin levels was then performed. Pattern I was classified as normal, patterns II, III and IV as borderline or diagnostic for diabetes, and pattern V as low insulin. This revealed that in the normal glucose tolerance group 2.5% had low insulin, 14% were borderline diabetic and 50% had diabetic insulin levels, with only 33% having a normal insulin response to an OGTT. In the equivocal glucose tolerance group, 10% had normal insulin levels, while 90% had diabetic patterns, and in those with glucose tolerance test positive for diabetes, 100% of the subjects had diabetic insulin patterns. This includes 62 cases who had pattern V (low insulin) and a clear hyperglycaemic response consistent with type 1 diabetes. Kraft's research indicated that 75% of those subjects with normal or equivocal glucose tolerance tests (n=2940) had borderline or abnormal insulin response patterns (patterns II, III and IV) and likely had 'diabetes in-situ' or 'occult diabetes'.7Another similar study by Dr Kraft produced identical conclusions and also compared two different methods of insulin estimation (RIA: radioimmunoassay and MEIA: microparticle enzyme immunoassay). Using the RIA 87.8% (n=303) and with MEIA 79.1% (n=273) of subjects with a normal or equivocal glucose tolerance test (Wilkerson score 0, ½, 1 or 1 ½) (n=345) were found to have abnormal insulin response patterns (pattern II, III, IV). Those with overt diabetes on glucose tolerance test (Wilkerson score 2 or 3) inevitably had abnormal or reduced insulin response patterns.8The flaw in Kraft's original research is that it did not account for a number of different insulin patterns, including those who had a fasting level between 30 and 50 microunits. Working with Dr Kraft, Crofts and colleagues9 redefined Kraft's original patterns to ensure all tests could be categorised.Patterns I, IV and V remained the same, but patterns II and III were expanded to include those with a fasting insulin between 31 and 49 microunits (inclusive). Crofts et al then reanalysed the data set using WHO glucose disorder definitions. Of the 3428 people with either impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, the vast majority (93%) also had a hyperinsulinaemic pattern. Hyperinsulinaemia also affected approximately 75% of the people with normal glucose tolerance (n=4030).Hayashi patternsMore recent prospective research by Hayashi et al10 further confirmed the above findings and showed that insulin concentrations during glucose tolerance test strongly predict the development of T2D. They followed 400 non-diabetic Japanese Americans for 10–11 years to assess incidence of T2D. Each participant underwent insulin estimation at baseline, 30, 60 and 120 min intervals during a 2-hour 75 g OGTT. The insulin response patterns were classified into five types, distinct from Kraft's. Pattern 1 included initial insulin peak within 30 min, and higher insulin level at 60 min than at 120 min; pattern 2, with similar initial peak, but 1-hour level was less than or equal to level at 2 hours; pattern 3, initial peak within 1 hour; pattern 4, with initial peak within first 2 hours, and a lower level at 30 min than at 60 min; and pattern 5, with initial peak within 2 hours, and equal or higher level at 30 min as compared with 60 min. After the follow-up 86 cases developed T2D. Patterns 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 demonstrated a cumulative incidence of 3.2%, 9.8%, 15.4%, 47.8% and 37.5%, respectively. The multiple-adjusted ORs for developing T2D were 12.55 (95% CI 4.79 to 32.89) for pattern 4, and 8.34 (95% CI 2.38 to 29.27) for pattern 5, as opposed to patterns 1 and 2. Also, this risk was independent of insulin secretion and sensitivity.",https://t.co/mWysfR7qye,others
Molecular Metabolism,"Current IssueVolume 23 | May 2019Original Research ArticleDysregulated transmethylation leading to hepatocellular carcinoma compromises redox homeostasis and glucose formationCurtis C. Hughey, Freyja D. James, Zhizhang Wang, Mickael Goelzer, David H. Wasserman Abstract | PDFObjective:The loss of liver glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) promotes liver steatosis and the transition to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous work showed endogenous glucose production is reduced in GNMT-null mice with gluconeogenic precursors being used in alternative biosynthetic pathways that utilize methyl donors and are linked to tumorigenesis. This metabolic programming occurs before the appearance of HCC in GNMT-null mice. The metabolic physiology that sustains liver tumor formation in GNMT-null mice is unknown. The studies presented here tested the hypothesis that nutrient flux pivots from glucose production to pathways that incorporate and metabolize methyl groups in GNMT-null mice with HCC.Methods:2H/13C metabolic flux analysis was performed in conscious, unrestrained mice lacking GNMT to quantify glucose formation and associated nutrient fluxes. Molecular analyses of livers from mice lacking GNMT including metabolomic, immunoblotting, and immunochemistry were completed to fully interpret the nutrient fluxes.Results:GNMT knockout (KO) mice showed lower blood glucose that was accompanied by a reduction in liver glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. NAD+ was lower and the NAD(P)H-to-NAD(P)+ ratio was higher in livers of KO mice. Indices of NAD+ synthesis and catabolism, pentose phosphate pathway flux, and glutathione synthesis were dysregulated in KO mice.Conclusion:Glucose precursor flux away from glucose formation towards pathways that regulate redox status increase in the liver. Moreover, synthesis and scavenging of NAD+ are both impaired resulting in reduced concentrations. This metabolic program blunts an increase in methyl donor availability, however, biosynthetic pathways underlying HCC are activated.

However, the role of these necroptotic regulators in diabetes remains unknown. Here we sought to delineate the role of MLKL in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D).Methods:We first analyzed the expression of key necroptotic regulators in obese/diabetic mouse models. We then utilized MLKL knockout (MLKL−/−) mice to evaluate the effects of MLKL on obesity-induced metabolic complications. We further determined the consequences of MLKL inhibition on hepatic insulin signaling and explored the underlying mechanism. Finally, we assessed the potential therapeutic effects of necroptotic inhibitor, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), in ob/ob mice.Results:In wild-type or obese mice (ob/ob, db/db, or diet-induced obesity), MLKL was increased in certain obesity-associated tissues, particularly in the liver. Whole-body deficiency of MLKL prevented obesity-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Inhibition of MLKL or other key necroptotic regulators enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. MLKL modulated insulin-stimulated PI(3,4,5)P3 production in liver cells but did not affect the expression of inflammatory genes in vitro and in vivo. Nec-1 administration ameliorated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in ob/ob mice.Conclusions:These findings reveal MLKL as a regulator of insulin sensitivity and suggest necroptotic regulators might be potential therapeutic targets for insulin resistance and T2D. [Hide abstract]Original Research ArticleTim-3 aggravates podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy by promoting macrophage activation via the NF-κB/TNF-α pathwayHuimin Yang, Tingting Xie, Dengren Li, Xianhong Du, Tixiao Wang, Chunyang Li, Xiaojia Song, Leiqi Xu, Fan Yi, Xiaohong Liang, Lifen Gao, Xiangdong Yang, Chunhong Ma Abstract | PDFObjective:Macrophage-mediated inflammation plays a significant role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Studies suggest that T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) has complicated roles in regulating macrophage activation, but its roles in the progression of DN are still completely unknown.Methods:We downregulated Tim-3 expression in kidney (intrarenal injection of Tim-3 shRNA expressing lentivirus or global Tim-3 knockout mice) and induced DN by streptozotocin (STZ). We analyzed the degree of renal injury, especially the podocyte injury induced by activated macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Then, we transferred different bone marrow derived macrophages (BMs) into STZ-induced Tim-3 knockdown mice to examine the effects of Tim-3 on macrophages in DN.Results:First, we found that Tim-3 expression on renal macrophages was increased in patients with DN and in two diabetic mouse models, i.e. STZ-induced diabetic mice and db/db mice, and positively correlated with renal dysfunction of DN patients. Tim-3 deficiency ameliorated renal damage in STZ-induced diabetes with concurrent increase in protein levels of Nephrin and WT-1. Similar effects were observed in mice with Tim-3 knockdown diabetic mice. Second, adoptive transfer of Tim-3-expressing macrophages, but not Tim-3 knockout macrophages, accelerated diabetic renal injury in DN mice, suggesting a key role for Tim-3 on macrophages in the development of DN. Furthermore, we found NF-κB activation and TNF-α excretion were upregulated by Tim-3 in diabetic kidneys, and podocyte injury was associated with the Tim-3-mediated activation of the NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway in DN macrophages both in vivo and in vitro.Conclusions:These results suggest that Tim-3 functions as a key regulator in renal inflammatory processes and serves as a potential therapeutic target for renal injury in DN.

Harris Abstract | Graphical abstract | PDFObjective:We hypothesized that DA and L-DOPA derived from nutritional tyrosine and the resultant observed postprandial plasma excursions of L-DOPA and DA might affect glucose tolerance via their ability to be taken-up by beta cells and inhibit glucose-stimulated β-cell insulin secretion.Methods:To investigate a possible circuit between meal-stimulated 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) and dopamine (DA) production in the GI tract and pancreatic β-cells, we: 1) mapped GI mucosal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC); 2) measured L-DOPA and DA content of GI mucosal tissues following meal challenges with different L-tyrosine (TYR) content, 3) determined whether meal TYR content impacts plasma insulin and glucose excursions; and 4) characterized postprandial plasma excursions of L-DOPA and DA in response to meal tyrosine content in rodents and a population of bariatric surgery patients. Next, we characterized: 1) the metabolic transformation of TYR and L-DOPA into DA in vitro using purified islet tissue; 2) the metabolic transformation of orally administrated stable isotope labeled TYR into pancreatic DA, and 3) using a nuclear medicine technique, we studied endocrine beta cells in situ release and binding of DA in response to a glucose challenge.Results:We demonstrate in rodents that intestinal content and circulatory concentrations L-DOPA and DA, plasma glucose and insulin are responsive to the tyrosine (TYR) content of a test meal. Intestinal expression of two enzymes, Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Aromatic Amino acid Decarboxylase (AADC), essential to the transformation of TYR to DA was mapped and the metabolism of metabolism of TYR to DA was traced in human islets and a rodent beta cell line in vitro and from gut to the pancreas in vivo. Lastly, we show that β cells secrete and bind DA in situ in response to glucose stimulation.Conclusions:We provide proof-of-principle evidence for the existence of a novel postprandial circuit of glucose homeostasis dependent on nutritional tyrosine. DA and L-DOPA derived from nutritional tyrosine may serve to defend against hypoglycemia via inhibition of glucose-stimulated β-cell insulin secretion as proposed by the anti-incretin hypothesis.

The mechanisms of the reduction in systemic TG levels remain unclear. We hypothesized that RYGB reduces intestinal TG secretion via altered enterocyte lipid handling.Methods:RYGB or Sham surgery was performed in diet-induced obese, insulin-resistant male Sprague–Dawley rats. First, we tested whether RYGB reduced test meal-induced TG levels in the intestinal lymph, a direct readout of enterocyte lipid secretion. Second, we examined whether RYGB modified TG enterocyte secretion at the single lipid level and in comparison to other lipid subclasses, applying mass spectrometry lipidomics to the intestinal lymph of RYGB and Sham rats (0–21 days after surgery). Third, we explored whether RYGB modulated the metabolic characteristics of primary enterocytes using transcriptional and functional assays relevant to TG absorption, reesterification, storage in lipid droplets, and oxidation.Results:RYGB reduced overall postprandial TG concentrations compared to Sham surgery in plasma and intestinal lymph similarly. RYGB reduced lymphatic TG concentrations more than other lipid subclasses, and shifted the remaining TG pool towards long-chain, unsaturated species. In enterocytes of fasted RYGB rats, lipid uptake was transcriptionally (Fatp4, Fabp2, Cd36) and functionally reduced compared to Sham, whereas TG reesterification genes were upregulated.Conclusion:Our results show that RYGB substantially reduces intestinal TG secretion and modifies enterocyte lipid absorption and handling in rats. These changes likely contribute to the improvements in the plasma TG profile observed after RYGB in humans.

Guertin Abstract | Graphical abstract | PDFObjective:Understanding the signaling mechanisms that control brown adipose tissue (BAT) development is relevant to understanding energy homeostasis and obesity. The AKT kinases are insulin effectors with critical in vivo functions in adipocytes; however, their role in adipocyte development remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to investigate AKT function in BAT development.Methods:We conditionally deleted Akt1 and Akt2 either individually or together with Myf5-Cre, which targets early mesenchymal precursors that give rise to brown adipocytes. Because Myf5-Cre also targets skeletal muscle and some white adipocyte lineages, comparisons were made between AKT function in BAT versus white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle development. We also deleted both Akt1 and Akt2 in mature brown adipocytes with Ucp1-Cre or Ucp1-CreER to investigate AKT1/2 signaling in BAT maintenance.Results:AKT1 and AKT2 are individually dispensable in Myf5-Cre lineages in vivo for establishing brown and white adipocyte precursor cell pools and for their ability to differentiate (i.e. induce PPARγ). AKT1 and AKT2 are also dispensable for skeletal muscle development, and AKT3 does not compensate in either the adipocyte or muscle lineages. In contrast, AKT2 is required for adipocyte lipid filling and efficient downstream AKT substrate phosphorylation. Mice in which both Akt1 and Akt2 are deleted with Myf5-Cre lack BAT but have normal muscle mass, and doubly deleting Akt1 and Akt2 in mature brown adipocytes, either congenitally (with Ucp1-Cre), or inducibly in older mice (with Ucp1-CreER), also ablates BAT. Mechanistically, AKT signaling promotes adipogenesis in part by stimulating ChREBP activity.Conclusions:AKT signaling is required in vivo for BAT development but dispensable for skeletal muscle development. AKT1 and AKT2 have both overlapping and distinct functions in BAT development with AKT2 being the most critical individual isoform. AKT1 and AKT2 also have distinct and complementary functions in BAT maintenance.

Tschöp, Timo D. Müller, Christoffer Clemmensen Abstract | PDFObjective:The contribution of brown adipose tissue (BAT) to adult human metabolic control is a topic of ongoing investigation. In context, understanding the cellular events leading to BAT uncoupling, heat production, and energy expenditure is anticipated to produce significant insight into this endeavor. The phosphoinositide interacting regulator of transient receptor potentials (Pirt) was recently put forward as a key protein regulating cold sensing downstream of the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8). Notably, TRPM8 has been identified as a non-canonical regulator of BAT thermogenesis. The aim of this investigation was to delineate the role of Pirt in energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism - and the possible involvement of Pirt in TRPM8-elicited energy expenditure.Methods:To this end, we metabolically phenotyped male and female Pirt deficient (Pirt−/−) mice exposed to a low-fat chow diet or to a high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diet.Results:We identified that chow-fed female Pirt−/− mice have an increased susceptibility to develop obesity and glucose intolerance. This effect is abrogated when the mice are exposed to a HFHS diet. Conversely, Pirt−/− male mice display no metabolic phenotype on either diet relative to wild-type (WT) control mice. Finally, we observed that Pirt is dispensable for TRPM8-evoked energy expenditure.Conclusions:We here report subtle metabolic abnormalities in female, but not male, Pirt−/− mice. Future studies are required to tease out if metabolic stressors beyond dietary interventions, e.g. temperature fluctuations, are interacting with Pirt-signaling and metabolic control in a sex-specific fashion.

Increasing evidence has pointed towards the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORα) as an important nuclear receptor involved in several biological processes. RORα full body knockout mice display improved metabolic phenotypes on both chow and high fat (60% fat, 20% carbohydrate) diets, but also have severe behavioral abnormalities. Here we investigated the effect of hepatic RORα by generating mice with liver-specific RORα deletion to elucidate the role of this nuclear receptor on host metabolism.Methods:8 week-old mice with liver-specific RORα deletion and littermate controls were fed either chow or western-style diets (40% fat, 40% carbohydrate) for 12 weeks. Metabolic phenotyping was performed at the end of the dietary intervention.Results:Here, we show that hepatic RORα deletion does not affect the metabolic susceptibility to either chow or western-style diet in terms of glucose metabolism and adiposity.Conclusions:Our data indicate that liver deletion of RORα does not have a pivotal role in the regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism on chow or western-style diet.

Moresco, John R. Yates, Bernard Kok, Enrique Saez, Robert S. Ross, Aaron P. Russell, Anastasia Kralli Abstract | PDFObjective:Endurance exercise training remodels skeletal muscle, leading to increased mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity. How exercise entrains skeletal muscle signaling pathways to induce adaptive responses remains unclear. In past studies, we identified Perm1 (PGC-1 and ERR induced regulator, muscle 1) as an exercise-induced gene and showed that Perm1 overexpression elicits similar muscle adaptations as endurance exercise training. The mechanism of action and the role of Perm1 in exercise-induced responses are not known. In this study, we aimed to determine the pathway by which Perm1 acts as well as the importance of Perm1 for acute and long-term responses to exercise.Methods:We performed immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify Perm1 associated proteins, and validated Perm1 interactions with the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). We also knocked down Perm1 expression in gastrocnemius muscles of mice via AAV-mediated delivery of shRNA and assessed the impact of reduced Perm1 expression on both acute molecular responses to a single treadmill exercise bout and long-term adaptive responses to four weeks of voluntary wheel running training. Finally, we asked whether Perm1 levels are modulated by diet or diseases affecting skeletal muscle function.Results:We show that Perm1 associates with skeletal muscle CaMKII and promotes CaMKII activation. In response to an acute exercise bout, muscles with a knock down of Perm1 showed defects in the activation of CaMKII and p38 MAPK and blunted induction of regulators of oxidative metabolism. Following four weeks of voluntary training, Perm1 knockdown muscles had attenuated mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, we found that Perm1 expression is reduced in diet-induced obese mice and in muscular dystrophy patients and mouse models.Conclusions:Our findings identify Perm1 as a muscle-specific regulator of exercise-induced signaling and Perm1 levels as tuners of the skeletal muscle response to exercise. The decreased Perm1 levels in states of obesity or muscle disease suggest that Perm1 may link pathological states to inefficient exercise responses.

Michael Abstract | PDFBackground:Cancer cells possess a common metabolic phenotype, rewiring their metabolic pathways from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and anabolic circuits, to support the energetic and biosynthetic requirements of continuous proliferation and migration. While, over the past decade, molecular and cellular studies have clearly highlighted the association of oncogenes and tumor suppressors with cancer-associated glycolysis, more recent attention has focused on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in mediating this metabolic shift. Accumulating studies have connected aberrant expression of miRNAs with direct and indirect regulation of aerobic glycolysis and associated pathways.Scope of review:This review discusses the underlying mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells and provides arguments that the earlier paradigm of cancer glycolysis needs to be updated to a broader concept, which involves interconnecting biological pathways that include miRNA-mediated regulation of metabolism. For these reasons and in light of recent knowledge, we illustrate the relationships between metabolic pathways in cancer cells. We further summarize our current understanding of the interplay between miRNAs and these metabolic pathways. This review aims to highlight important metabolism-associated molecular components in the hunt for selective preventive and therapeutic treatments.Major conclusions:Metabolism in cancer cells is influenced by driver mutations but is also regulated by posttranscriptional gene silencing. Understanding the nuanced regulation of gene expression in these cells and distinguishing rapid cellular responses from chronic adaptive mechanisms provides a basis for rational drug design and novel therapeutic strategies.

Does Walmart Sell Insulin for $25 a Vial Without a Prescription?,"In early February 2019, amid continued public outcry over the soaring cost of life-saving pharmaceuticals, readers shared a screen-captured image on social media of a local news station's reporting on the story of a woman who said she bought inexpensive insulin without a prescription at Walmart:Readers asked us whether this was true. It is true, although you should note Walmart sells human insulin, an older version of the glucose-moderating hormone, whereas most insulin-dependent diabetics are currently prescribed insulin analogs that have evolved to help prevent dangerous swings in blood-glucose levels.The screenshot above was taken from a 4 February 2019 news broadcast from Dallas–Fort Worth television station KDFW:We confirmed with Walmart that the retail chain does indeed sell human insulin without a prescription (except in Indiana). That product is Novo Nordisk-manufactured Novolin, which Walmart has branded as ReliOn and sells for $24.88 per vial. Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis confirmed to us that the company has ""maintained, through negotiation, the same retail to patients since 2011."" To say that the insulin is sold ""over-the-counter"" isn't quite accurate, however, as customers must ask a pharmacist for it.Although this revelation might be important, life-saving information for diabetics, an important caveat is that human insulin behaves differently than the newer analog insulin currently retailing for more than $300 a vial.Dr. Todd Hobbs, chief medical officer for Novo Nordisk, wrote that the different types of insulin have the same effect of lowering blood-glucose levels, but, ""Training is required whenever someone is prescribed insulin, whether that be human insulin or the newer analog insulin products. Differences in the timing of all types of insulin must be considered for patients to effectively use them … The difference in the types of insulin is related to how slowly or rapidly they are absorbed once injected. Scientific advances over the years have made improvements on the speed and length of time this absorption occurs.""Diabetes Forecast, a health-oriented magazine associated with the American Diabetics Association, explained the history of the two types of insulin and the difference in health benefits this way:In the 1970s, researchers discovered how to program bacteria in the lab to manufacture human insulin, and in 1982, regular human insulin became the first ""recombinant DNA"" drug product. ""It's a very pure, clean product, and it's exactly what we as humans make,"" [Virginia Commonwealth University School of Pharmacy associate professor and a spokesman for the American Association of Diabetes Educators Evan] Sisson says. Human insulin is now available as short-acting ""regular"" (or ""R"") insulin, which is used at mealtimes, and intermediate-acting NPH (or ""N"") insulin, which is used as a basal insulin …While the development of human insulin was a major advancement, it wasn't perfect. Regular insulin didn't hit the bloodstream quick enough to cover the rapid absorption of carbohydrates after meals, and it stuck around too long after meals, causing hypoglycemia [low blood glucose, which can lead to unconsciousness and death if untreated]. In 1996, Eli Lilly introduced the first rapid-acting insulin analog to the market: insulin lispro (Humalog). Insulin aspart (Novo Nordisk's Novolog) and insulin glulisine (Sanofi's Apidra) quickly followed. With rapid-acting insulin analogs, onset occurs 10 to 20 minutes after injection, instead of the 30 to 60 minutes it takes for regular human insulin to take effect. This allows people to inject their insulin right before a meal, rather than having to dose 30 minutes or more before eating …Deliver a dose of NPH [human] insulin, and it'll reach its peak about six to eight hours later. This means your insulin may peak while you're sleeping, posing a serious danger if you don't wake up to treat. Long-acting analogs, on the other hand, don't peak, resulting in more-stable blood glucose levels and fewer unexpected highs or lows. In fact, one study showed that long-acting analog insulin glargine reduced overnight bouts of hypoglycemia by up to 48 percent compared with NPH. In another study, detemir reduced nighttime hypoglycemia by 34 percent. This is especially beneficial for people with type 1, who need to be much more precise about matching insulin dosages with their insulin needs to avoid nighttime lows, says Sisson.Note, there are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetics' bodies cannot manufacture insulin, the hormone responsible for glucose absorption. Type 2 diabetics' bodies, on the other hand, become resistant to insulin. In most cases, Type 1 diabetes starts in childhood, whereas Type 2 is sometimes referred to as ""adult-onset"" diabetes.Writing for Insulin Nation, Nicki Nichols explained why the older form of human insulin is difficult to control in children:When my child was first diagnosed, she was on NPH. It was incredibly difficult to limit a growing child's diet to such a strict schedule. Here's what it looked like:8 a.m.- 45-carb meal10:30 a.m. – 15-carb snack12 p.m. – 45-carb meal2 p.m. – 15-carb snack5 p.m. – 45-carb meal7:30 p.m. – 15-20 carb snack before bed to keep blood sugar up overnight.I cannot tell you how many times my child refused to eat the 45 carbs in her dinner. There is something wrong when you are fussing at your 5-year-old to stop eating her green beans and to eat her bread, or mashed potatoes, or pasta.The screen shot from the KDFW report no doubt went viral as a result of an ongoing controversy over the cost of analog insulin, which as of 7 February 2019 soared to a retail price of more than $300 per vial. Americans have been awash in medical horror stories such the death of Jesse Lutgen, a 32-year-old Type 1 diabetic who lost his job at a distribution center in Dubuque, Iowa, and with it, his health insurance. He was found dead in his home in February 2018, having run out of insulin. His last vials of the medication were given to him by a friend.",https://t.co/wAerH5IN1S,others
Low-Carb Eating Plan,"The idea of following a low-carb diet can feel a bit overwhelming. (Just how many carbs are we talking here?) But with so many people seemingly shedding pounds and finding a richer lifestyle after going low-carb, it's oh-so enticing. Before you decide for yourself if cutting carbs is right for you, make sure you know exactly what the plan entails. We asked Stefanie Schwartz, MS, RD, CDN, of Nutritionally Yours, some of your most pressing questions.What Are the Benefits of a Low-Carb Diet?Obviously, a low-carb diet can help you lose weight, as long as you're eating the right foods and watching how many calories you get each day. Eating fewer carbs helps lower your blood sugar, which allows your body to burn stored fat for energy instead of glucose.Aside from that, Stefanie explained that a low-carb diet can help prevent cravings and lower your blood pressure and triglycerides, improving your overall health.How Many Carbs Should You Eat?There's no one number that's right for everyone. However, according to dietary guidelines, carbs should make up 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories. Keep in mind that one gram of carbs translates to four calories. ""So, assuming a 2,000-calorie diet, an individual should consume 225 to 325 grams of carbs daily,"" Stefanie told POPSUGAR. However, when you're looking to lose weight, you want your carbs to be under 150 grams per day. ""On average, keeping carb intake to 50 to 100 grams per day is low enough for an effective weight loss, yet not too low to put you in ketosis,"" she said. (Ketosis is the goal of the very low-carb ketogenic diet.)To come up with a more precise amount of carbs you should eat based on your sex, age, and activity level, draw up a health plan with your own dietitian or doctor so you can be sure you're eating enough of the right foods.What Foods Can You Eat on a Low-Carb Diet?You might think that all you need to do is cut back on carbs â€"" but this diet is really about choosing your carbs wisely. Stefanie explained that the ideal carbs to consume are from high-fiber, nonrefined sources, like oatmeal, yams, quinoa, wild and brown rice, farro, vegetables, and fruits.The key to sticking to your low-carb diet is really nailing your grocery shopping and meal prep. So, plan to pick up a combination of lean proteins, healthy fats, and virtuous carbs that you can mix and match to create a healthy menu each week. Stefanie suggested several meal options to get you started:Make a vegetable or chicken soup in the slow cooker.Make a turkey meat loaf using oats or almond meal as the binder and serve with mashed cauliflower.Make a batch of turkey meat sauce to serve with zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash.Buy vacuum-sealed fish filets and bake them in the oven with olive oil, lemon, and capers and serve with roasted brussels sprouts.Make a vegetable frittata with whatever vegetables you have on hand.Don't forget that you'll need snacks, too â€"" Stefanie recommends hard-boiled eggs, turkey and cucumber roll-ups, a small serving of nuts or seeds, some cottage cheese, and pickles.Is a Low-Carb Diet Safe?According to Stefanie, there's no real drawback to sticking to a low-carb diet in the long-term. ""The rewards of a low-carb lifestyle are an increase in energy, a reduced appetite and cravings, a drop in insulin levels and glucose levels, and less inflammation,"" she told POPSUGAR, and all of those things are absolutely positives in your life. She also pointed out that the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and lean protein are excellent choices for what to put into your body. However, if you do come off a low-carb diet, you can expect to see a little uptick in your weight, simply because added carbs means water retention. ""The trick to adding more carbs after following a low-carbohydrate diet is to add them back slowly and with more fiber-rich foods. Make sure to keep your water intake high to flush your system,"" Stefanie said.As always, your best bet is to discuss any dietary changes with your doctor or dietitian before actually doing it. That way, you can decide together what the best plan of action is for you.",https://t.co/388bJzrLEA,others
Democratic lawmaker to drug industry on insulin prices: 'Your days are numbered',"In a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on insulin prices Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and fellow lawmakers blasted manufacturers and drug industry intermediaries for creating a situation in which as much as a quarter of the population with diabetes is rationing and skimping on lifesaving doses of the drug because of cost.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Schakowsky told the panel. ""I just want you to know your days are numbered."" Lawmakers heard from patients with diabetes as well, including 28-year-old Kristen Whitney Daniels, who was kicked off her parents' insurance plan when she reached 26, and started rationing insulin then. ""Nobody cared or nobody understood that without this next vial of insulin, I wouldn't live to see another week. […] I can't really explain how isolating and how terrifying it is.""It's also totally unnecessary and completely unjustified. The man who discovered insulin nearly 100 years ago, Frederick Banting, refused to patent the drug under his name. With his co-inventors James Collip and Charles Best, he sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto, because they rejected the idea that people who needed this new wonder drug to survive would not be able to afford it. Since then, this drug that has been around since 1923 has become a potent symbol of corporate greed and everything wrong with our healthcare system. Pharmaceutical companies are holding diabetes patients hostage just because they can, because they can get away with continuing to jack up prices and profits.That's in private and public healthcare systems. Since 2007, a new analysis from Kaiser Family Foundation finds, the cost of insulin in Medicare Part D has risen 840 percent. Yes, there are 3.1 million enrollees with diabetes now in Medicare, as opposed to 1.6 million in 2007, but the huge spike in costs can't be attributed just to that. In addition, ""out-of-pocket spending among all Part D enrollees on insulin quadrupled between 2007 and 2016, from $236 million to $968 million, reflecting both an increase in the number of users and price increases for insulin.""The companies are doing this because they aren't constrained by any regulation. Medicare can't even negotiate drug prices. But in making this old, critical, life-saving drug a flashpoint in the healthcare debate, the industry might have just created the wedge Democrats need to burn this system down.",https://t.co/w00mkaTHbu,others
Blame-game weary House panel vows action on insulin prices,"Lawmakers told the three drugmakers that sell insulin in the U.S. and the middlemen companies that negotiate what insurers pay for those medicines that if they did not find a way to lower prices, Capitol Hill would do it for them. Executives from the insulin companies, Eli Lilly and Co., Novo Nordisk A/S and Sanofi, and the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s OptumRx and Cigna Corp.'s Express Scripts, all agreed the U.S. drug pricing system was broken. But members of the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee made it clear they were tired of hearing that excuse and wanted real solutions to soaring insulin prices, which have left some patients having to ration their medicine, often resulting in their illness worsening, with some even dying. ""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., told the drugmakers and PBM middlemen. The hearing was the second time this month the subcommittee had discussed the high costs of insulin. It had convened an earlier session on the matter on April 2, where the lawmakers heard from a panel of diabetes experts, advocates and patients. ""We have the names of people who have died because they couldn't get their insulin,"" Schakowsky said at the April 10 hearing. The Illinois lawmaker warned the companies they were ""in trouble"" and members of Congress — on both sides of the aisle — were committed to taking action. The House and the Senate both have ongoing bipartisan investigations into insulin prices and both chambers have convened hearings on the matter. The Senate Finance Committee had met just a day earlier to examine the overall problem of high U.S. drug prices, where the senators grilled executives from CVS, Cigna and OptumRx and two other PBMs. The Finance Committee had convened a hearing in February with executives from seven drug companies, though Sanofi was the only insulin maker to appear before that panel. 'Your days are numbered' The April 10 House hearing was the first time lawmakers had summoned insulin makers and PBMs to testify jointly on Capitol Hill. ""If you think you can just out talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" Schakowsky said. Hours before the hearing, Sanofi revealed it planned to offer its insulin products for $99 per month for up to 10 boxes, though not including its combination medicine. Weeks earlier, Lilly also said it would offer a generic version of its Humalog insulin at half the price the brand is listed. Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., however, rebuked the companies, noting those efforts had come after years of public outcry and only shortly before the drugmakers were to appear before Congress. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, suggested that if drugmakers and PBMs could not soon bring prices down significantly, the government should take over the situation and set the prices of prescription medicines. He noted that throughout the hearing, the biopharmaceutical companies had pointed the finger at the PBMs and the middlemen pointed right back at the drugmakers — going in circles blaming one another, much the same way the battle over prices has continued outside the walls of Congress. ""You keep saying the system, the system, the system doesn't work. Why doesn't this competitive market-based system work anymore? What has happened?"" Pallone asked. He pressed drugmakers on why they were blaming PBMs when the manufacturers in fact set and control the list prices of their medicines and have the power to bring them down. The drug companies, however, insisted that their list prices are driven by the rebates and discounts demanded by the PBMS, which determine placement on formularies — insurance companies' lists of covered medicines. Another Democrat, Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland, said that while the U.S. drug pricing system may have needed an intermediary in the beginning, ""now things have gotten out of control."" He suggested PBMs should be converted to a system like utilities or nonprofits, with the government having some control in their activities. Change is not optional Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., the only licensed pharmacist in Congress, said he remembered the days when he could order drugs for his community pharmacy directly from biopharmaceutical companies, without having to go through the middlemen. ""I have seen patients at the counter having to make a decision between buying medicine and between buying groceries,"" Carter said. ""I was the boots on the ground there and that's why I'm so passionate about it."" Carter said drugmakers and PBMs have accomplished something lawmakers have been unable to do his entire time in Congress: create bipartisanship. ""This is going to end,"" he said. ""I've seen what you've done."" Oversight Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said Congress was committed to taking action to change the ""smoke and mirror system"" of the way drugmakers and PBMs do business together, particularly with insulin prices. She said the subcommittee would work on solutions in a bipartisan manner with input from the companies and then bring the drugmakers and the PBMs back in July or September to talk about any progress they have made on fixing the situation. ""This is not optional and this is going to happen,"" DeGette vowed.",https://t.co/mq88Xu2BKm,others
Early responses of insulin signaling to high-carbohydrate and high-fat overfeeding,"The salient feature of the current study is that short-term overfeeding in healthy lean individuals (40% caloric excess for 5 days) results in significant changes in skeletal muscle insulin signaling before any alterations in total body insulin sensitivity are evident. Furthermore, macronutrient composition of the overfeeding diet has a profound influence on changes in insulin signaling in skeletal muscle.We found that consuming a high-carbohydrate (HC) hypercaloric diet results in a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation IRS-1, with increased association of p110 (a catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase) with IRS-1 and enhanced IRS-1-associated insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. These changes in insulin signaling usually denote increased insulin sensitivity and may be a result of the modest hyperinsulinemia seen with HC overfeeding. Whole body insulin sensitivity as measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, however, did not change after 5 days of overfeeding, suggesting the presence of early changes in insulin signaling in response to a high-carbohydrate load directed at better disposal of this load in order to maintain whole-body insulin sensitivity.In contrast, we found that high-fat (HF) overfeeding results in a significant increase in serine phosphorylated IRS-1, a traditional determinant of insulin resistance. At the same time, HF overfeeding is associated with increased expression of p85α and decreased association of p110 with IRS-1 and decreased insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. Although in the present study we cannot determine which component (serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or increased expression of p85α) plays a greater role, these changes are typically associated with insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. In our previous studies, overfeeding healthy female subjects with 50% caloric excess for 3 days, we also observed an increase in expression of p85α before serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 [16], suggesting that excess energy intake may drive overexpression of p85α as an earliest molecular change in response to overfeeding. As with HC overfeeding, these ex-vivo alterations were not accompanied by any change in the in vivo assessment of insulin sensitivity. Excess fat intake appears to alter carbohydrate induced insulin signaling at the level of skeletal muscle but without an appreciable change in whole body insulin sensitivity. These findings again imply the appearance of early changes to acute bouts of overnutrition; however, the effects vary depending on the macronutrient composition of the diet.Assessing effects further downstream of PI 3-kinase, we found that both HC and HF overfeeding led to significant increases in activation of the nutrient sensor, mTOR, and its downstream target, S6K1. Ability of S6K1 to promote serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been suggested as a potential mechanism of insulin resistance [30–37, 53, 54]. In this study, both overfeeding diets induced significant increases in phosphorylation of mTOR and S6K1, yet only HF overfeeding was associated with increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Further studies are needed to evaluate this discrepancy.Interestingly, in a subset of subjects, we found a significant increase in intramyocellular lipid content (IMCL) following both HC and HF overfeeding compared to baseline. This increase was observed regardless of the macronutrient content of the diet. This increase in IMCL was also seen in the setting of unchanged whole-body insulin sensitivity, suggesting that either IMCL is not associated with insulin sensitivity, the duration of the study was not sufficient to see an effect, or the type or source of myocellular lipid may be important. Although literature suggests that increases in intramuscular triglyceride are associated with increased insulin resistance [55–57], some data suggest these may not be related [58, 59]. Additionally, studies have shown that the source of intramyocellular lipid may determine how the lipid accumulation affects insulin responsiveness. Ceremide and diacylglycerol (DAG) have been linked to deleterious effects on insulin signaling in muscle and DAG levels can increase following intake of a diet high in saturated fat [60, 61]. In contrast, triacylglycerol fatty acids (TAG) accumulate in muscle following a diet high in poluyunsaturated fatty acids and can lead to improved insulin sensitivity [61]. Clearly further studies are needed to understand the relationship and interaction between IMCL and insulin signaling. Future studies would be strengthened by performing direct measurements of intramyocellular lipid metabolites.There are a few limitations to this study that need to be discussed. First, the duration and amount of overfeeding were chosen to be 5 days and 40%, respectively. It is possible that a longer duration of overnutrition is necessary to impact whole-body insulin sensitivity. Brøns, et al. recently published data where they also did not see any appreciable difference in whole-body insulin sensitivity, as measured by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp following 5 days of 50% caloric excess feeding [17]. Conceivably, changes in the whole-body insulin sensitivity may not be seen either until an individual begins to show clinically significant weight gain or there is a more significant caloric excess. Studies examining longer term overfeeding should be performed to further assess this issue. Second, despite strict eligibility criteria there was significant heterogeneity in baseline measures of insulin sensitivity (M-value: 7.68 to 17.71 mg/kgFFM/min). While we did not see an association between baseline insulin sensitivity and responses to overfeeding there may be differences in how individuals can or cannot respond to overnutrition based on their baseline insulin sensitivity. Studies in larger cohorts of subjects might be needed to uncover changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity following overnutrition.",https://t.co/IWg2t1ejbc,others
How to Take An Insulin Pump Break,"Even if you love managing your diabetes using an insulin pump there are good reasons to take a break from wearing it. This photo of me on a beach in France expresses the joy—and freedom—I feel during my summer pump vacations. At just nine years old, a true bond was formed—a bond stronger than the pump site and tubing delivering insulin into my body or even my love for mac and cheese. This bond was with my first insulin pump or as my dad liked to call it, a used car attached at the hip.Within a few days of starting on my pump, I felt like I had my life back. You see when I was 7-years-old I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and at the time, diabetes management options were limited. Those were the days of multiple daily injections (MDI), NPH and regular insulin. This meant a strict schedule of eating a carefully-calculated amount of carbohydrates timed to certain times of day every single day. There was very little wiggle room—difficult for anyone but really hard for a little kid! When I started using my pump it was if the strict schedule became unnecessary overnight. From there, I've never looked back. The thought of doing multiple daily injections again just seemed like the worst punishment imaginable!The Thunderstorm That Ruined EverythingFast forward several years, I reconnected with a friend from diabetes camp who had moved away, and I learned what seemed unfathomable at the time...she told me she didn't use her insulin pump in the summer. At all. For several months. She took a pump vacation each summer.This option had never occurred to me and I couldn't imagine any reason to go back to MDI. I also didn't know anyone who went back and forth like that. In my mind, there were two types of people with type 1 diabetes—those who used an insulin pump or those who didn't. But I was curious...I decided to take the plunge and went off my pump for one important evening—the night of my junior prom. I didn't want to worry about my dress or my pump site ripping out or people noticing my diabetes. It seemed like a good way to take my diabetes off center stage but it went horribly wrong...at least in the eyes of teenage me!I had a vial of insulin and syringes neatly stored in my small, fancy clutch. My pediatric endocrinologist and I had planned the whole thing out and it was a relief to know I didn't have to worry about a pump site location or where to put my pump while wearing a bright orange dress. Unfortunately, Mother Nature had other plans...there was a terrible thunderstorm and being the clutz that I am, I dropped that pretty clutch in a puddle as I stepped out of the party bus to head into the prom. My supplies spilled out and to my complete embarrassment, my diabetes took center stage!In spite of the prom disaster, the following summer between my senior year of high school and freshman year of college, I reconsidered the option and embarked on my first long-term pump break, or as I came to call it, my pump vacation. At that point, I'd been connected to an electronic device for about nine years straight but I couldn't help noticing people I knew who lives with diabetes succeeding without relying on an insulin pump. Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing?This time around, the experience was successful and I've taken a pump vacation almost every summer since them. Why Mess with a Good Thing?You may be thinking if I love my insulin pump so much… why take an extended break from it?There are a bunch of reasons...one is the weather. In the south where I'm from (Georgia), it's hot and muggy. Outside in the sun, the insulin in my pump would overheat and that's not good.Another is that part of the joy of summer is being outside but the heat and humidity caused me to sweat, a lot, and sweat makes pump sites fall off. Plus, the heat had me headed straight to the water for a swim which meant I needed to disconnect the pump. The trouble with that is I often got so involved in the summer fun that I'd forget to reconnect and my blood sugars would start rising!Skimpy summer outfits were another problem...with more skin showing, it's more difficult to hide a pump and being a self-conscious teen—I couldn't help feeling that all eyes were on my diabetes. All these considerations lead me to time my pump break with summertime but over time, I've found other reasons to take pump vacations—It's good for my mental health. If I'm suffering from diabetes burnout I find it helps to spice up my management.What are my basal rates, correction factors, and carb ratios? On a pump, it's easy to forget, but when I take a break, I reconnect with those numbers again. That's good for me and good for my diabetes management because it helps me feel prepared for an emergency.Knowing how to deal with diabetes in the old-school MDI way is important in case my pump breaks or I'm out of supplies. Plus, pump sites cause scar tissue and a pump break gives my body some time to heal. Tips If You're Considering a Pump BreakTalk to your doctor before you make any changes to your diabetes management. You might also need to revisit how to deliver insulin using injections if it's been a while.Make sure you have the supplies and prescriptions you need. Keep in mind: you might end up taking a little more insulinWrite down all of your carb ratios, correction factors, and basal rates so you can refer to them while you're on MDI.Figure out how to track your data. Since you won't be attached to your pump it may be more difficult to track how many carbs you eaten, when your last correction occurred and how much insulin you administered. You can use pen and paper or find a diabetes app designed for that purpose. Pick a relaxed time to experiment with a pump break. A time when you don't have something major going on because it can take your body time to adjust.My insulin breaks teach me a lot about myself and my condition. Yes, I still LOVE my insulin pump, but I appreciate having a break from it too. I'm also glad to know I have diabetes management options, too. It's not just pump or no pump!

Insulin Temperature Control: What You Need to Know,"Earlier this year, our own Wil Dubois landed in the ER with DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) that seemingly came out of nowhere. This was a wake-up call for him to revisit the basics of type 1 diabetes management, including the importance of keeping your insulin temperature-safe so you know it's working properly. Recognizing Spoiled Insulin What happens when you leave a chunk of raw prime rib out in the sun? Right. After a while, it starts to stink. Guess what? Insulin is the same. Just like prime rib, it's a protein. And just like prime rib, it can spoil in high temperatures.Of course, spoiled insulin doesn't smell rancid. It still smells like Band-Aids. And it doesn't change color, or give you any other clues that it's spoiled. It just stops working, or at a minimum it stops working properly, leaving you with blood sugars that start to climb and a need for multiple correction doses that just don't seem to be making any impact. You probably knew that, or at least you probably did at one time. But do you know how hot is too hot? Or how long insulin can beat the heat? There are many options nowadays to keep our insulin at ideal temps whether we're at home, traveling on planes and trains, or out in the wild where weather extremes can present different medication challenges.Share on Pinterest What's the Best Temperature to Store Insulin? The three major insulin makers -- Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi -- tell us that ""refrigeration temperatures between 36° and 46°F are maintained for insulin products during the manufacturing process"" and that remains the recommended range. They also warn strongly against putting insulin in the freezer, or directly adjacent to the refrigerator cooling element, as freezing renders insulin immediately ineffective. According to Consumer Reports, the sweet spot for a kitchen fridge is 37° F -- apparently ideal for keeping veggies like lettuce free of ice crystals, while suppressing the spread of bacteria. But that's pretty close to the bottom of the ideal insulin temp range, so we need to be careful. Many people with diabetes have a habit of taking their insulin directly from the pharmacy to the kitchen fridge. While this is generally good enough, it's important to be alert to colder corners and know that the overall temperature of a full fridge can be lower than the temperature in a nearly empty one. The butter compartment generally remains a good choice of fridge placement for insulin, as it turns out. Now let's turn to the specific insulin you may be using. Target Temperatures, by Insulin Brand and TypeDo different insulins have different recommended temperatures for safe storage? Starting with Novo Nordisk, the company that makes more kinds of insulin than anyone else, here's the official word on product storage:Long-acting (basal) insulin Levemir, should be kept in a refrigerator at that sweet spot between 36° and 46° Fahrenheit. Novo tells us that once unopened, vials or pens can be kept safely at room temperature so long as they are protected from heat sources and direct sunlight, and that the medicine will still function for up to 42 days. Apparently, on day 43, it turns into a pumpkin. Wait, what? How is room temp defined? Well, the problem may be that Novo Nordisk is a Danish company, and it's cooler in Denmark than in Phoenix, Arizona, or lots of other places. Their official safe room temp for insulin no hotter than 86° F. Meanwhile, open in-use pens and vials, ""must NOT be stored in a refrigerator"" (the capital letter emphasis is Novo's), and have the same 42-day life that unopened room temp Levemir has. Fast-acting (bolus) insulin Novolog has the same temperature ranges, for both unopened or in use, but a shorter (Danish) room temperature lifespan: 28 days. It also has an additional interesting note: Six-days max life in an insulin pump reservoir, unless exposed to temperatures in excess of 98.6° F, in which case it needs to be pitched out.Pumpers: Don't snuggle up with someone running a mild fever. OK, and what about the newest insulin formulations from Novo? Are they more robust than our old standbys? Nope. Ultra fasting-acting Fiasp has the exact same recommendations as Novolog. Ultra long-acting basal insulin Tresiba has the same temps and rules as Levemir, except it apparently lasts a full 56 days at Danish room temps. What about other brands and formulations? They all have the same 36° to 46° range: Sanofi's fasting-acting Apidra, and Lilly's long-acting Humalog/Admelog, Lantus/Basaglar, and Toujeo.What about insulin mixes? And non-insulin injectable diabetes medications? Yup, they all recommend exactly the same temperature range for safe storage. Just flip to section 16 of the Prescribing Information sheet (basically the Bible for each med) to confirm its ideal temperature range. Still, just for fun, let's look at old-school insulin. Was pioneer insulin tougher?Looking at the data for Novolin R and N—the forerunners of the forerunners of today's insulins—they too, have the magic 36° and 46° F range, but I guess due to global warming, room temps were cooler back then: 77 degrees. And what about farther back in time? How about animal insulin? We couldn't find any data for them online (as these insulins predate the Internet), but Merck's Vetsulin, a pig-based veterinary insulin for cats and dogs, interestingly, it has the exact same temp range. We queried all the major insulin players on where this temperature standard originated, but didn't get much information. Novo was the only company to respond, with their Director of Diabetes Communications Michael Bachner writing to say he was unable to locate any sources on why storage temperature ""hasn't changed over the years with newer insulin formulations."" Tools for Keeping Insulin CoolThe good news is that working insulin—the open vials and pens you're actively using—doesn't need to be kept cool. In use, there's no benefit to actually keeping insulin cold. It will neither prolong its life nor make it work better, plus cold insulin stings when you inject it. The trick is not so much keeping your open insulin cool when in use, but rather, to not let it get hot.To do this, you just need to make sure your house, work place, car, purse/go-bag, and pocket never get hotter than the top level of Danish room temperature (than 86° F), which nearly every house, work place, car, purse/go-bag, and pocket is sure to hit in the summer here in the USA.So what to do?Ice packs were the traditional solution. But while ice packs are great for post-surgical swelling, and may yet be useful in treating hangovers, as a means of keeping insulin cool they're woefully ineffective. The ice melts quickly, they're messy, plus they actually keep insulin cooler than it needs to be, at least for working insulin. Ice packs might be a good solution for transporting an inventory of insulin for an extended vacation, but that's about it.Thankfully there are some great products to help solve this problem: Medicool, which has been around for quite a while, specializes in a wide range of insulated coolers with a molded insert that needs to be frozen, then re-frozen to be used again. It's a small step up from an ice bag, at least in terms of being less messy, but refreezing takes time. The company also sells a small portable refrigerator.Personally, I'm a big fan of the Frio cooling wallets, which are light, simple, compact, and easy to use. They use evaporative cooling to keep insulin in that sub-80 range for 48 hours, even when the outside temps are well above 100 degrees. To re-use, you just soak the inner sleeve in water and you're good to go. Frios have the advantage of working in reverse, too, protecting insulin from getting too cold in freezing weather.Zhengzhou Dison Electric Co, Ltd. makes a variety of models of portable refrigerators for medicine. How large a variety? How does 62 different models sound to you?A new trend in insulin temp control is the use of stainless thermos technology such as the Insulin Safe and its cousins, which can be found on Amazon, eBay, and Aliexpress/Alibaba. The novel Vivi products replace the cap of most of the disposable insulin pens on the market, and use phase change material to keep insulin at steady temps for up to 12 hours without electricity, water, or refrigeration. It magically starts working at around 84° and holds the insulin at 82° for either one or two days, depending on the model. They also make a version of their device for insulin vials.MedAngel, a compact Bluetooth thermometer you can use to monitor the temperature of your insulin stash while you're traveling.So while you can't leave a chunk of raw prime rib lying around in the sun for too long, you can throw it into your freezer, and thaw it out months later for a good meal. That is sadly not true of insulin, so remember the basics: don't freeze it, and don't let your insulin get hot.",https://t.co/izLwLvPHBE,others

Democratic lawmaker to drug industry on insulin prices: 'Your days are numbered',"In a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on insulin prices Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and fellow lawmakers blasted manufacturers and drug industry intermediaries for creating a situation in which as much as a quarter of the population with diabetes is rationing and skimping on lifesaving doses of the drug because of cost.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Schakowsky told the panel. ""I just want you to know your days are numbered."" Lawmakers heard from patients with diabetes as well, including 28-year-old Kristen Whitney Daniels, who was kicked off her parents' insurance plan when she reached 26, and started rationing insulin then. ""Nobody cared or nobody understood that without this next vial of insulin, I wouldn't live to see another week. […] I can't really explain how isolating and how terrifying it is.""It's also totally unnecessary and completely unjustified. The man who discovered insulin nearly 100 years ago, Frederick Banting, refused to patent the drug under his name. With his co-inventors James Collip and Charles Best, he sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto, because they rejected the idea that people who needed this new wonder drug to survive would not be able to afford it. Since then, this drug that has been around since 1923 has become a potent symbol of corporate greed and everything wrong with our healthcare system. Pharmaceutical companies are holding diabetes patients hostage just because they can, because they can get away with continuing to jack up prices and profits.That's in private and public healthcare systems. Since 2007, a new analysis from Kaiser Family Foundation finds, the cost of insulin in Medicare Part D has risen 840 percent. Yes, there are 3.1 million enrollees with diabetes now in Medicare, as opposed to 1.6 million in 2007, but the huge spike in costs can't be attributed just to that. In addition, ""out-of-pocket spending among all Part D enrollees on insulin quadrupled between 2007 and 2016, from $236 million to $968 million, reflecting both an increase in the number of users and price increases for insulin.""The companies are doing this because they aren't constrained by any regulation. Medicare can't even negotiate drug prices. But in making this old, critical, life-saving drug a flashpoint in the healthcare debate, the industry might have just created the wedge Democrats need to burn this system down.",https://t.co/My7rYviwuo,others

It is about the time that you are not eating.31:24 Insulin inhibits lipolysis, stopping you from burning fat. 32:24 On a 7 day water only fast, your insulin falls and you switch from burning food to burning fat. 33:13 During fasting, as your insulin falls, you get a counter-regulatory hormone surge, increasing adrenaline, noradrenaline, growth hormone and cortisol. 33:53 There is a period of gluconeogenesis at around 24 hours into fasting. You will burn protein, not muscle. 35:40 If the old protein is never broken down, you cannot build new protein. 37:26 You get much better retention of lean mass with an intermittent fasting strategy over cutting calories. 38:24 Biggest Loser style diets sink metabolic rates. 42:15 Women can fast. Ghrelin is the hunger hormone. Women have higher ghrelin spikes.43:01 If you don't eat over 24 hours ghrelin spikes 3 times, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, then drops. Hunger does not continue to increase. 45:04 Cravings disappear with fasting and keto.49:38 You can eat high carb foods and keep low insulin. 51:09 Sugar is more fattening than other carbohydrates. 53:51 Natural foods have natural satiety mechanisms.01:08:31 Type 2 diabetes is misunderstood by doctors. 01:10:08 Blood glucose is a symptom of type 2 diabetes. We treat the symptom, not the disease. 01:12:15 Type 2 diabetes is reversible, except for the very late stage. 01:16:42 The longer you've been overweight the more it effects weight loss. 01:18:08 There are conflicts of interest in medicine. Much evidence is produced by pharmaceutical companies. Universities take funding from industry and produce shoddy research. 01:30:21 Bias in nutrition science is rampant and has stymied the advancement of actual science. Special interest needs to be out of research.",https://t.co/hTvjShMBv9,others
Pushing diabetics to take insulin is a medical scam: Fiona Godlee,"Fiona Godlee, the first woman editor of the BMJ (originally called the British Medical Journal), is no ivory-tower academic. A crusader for medical ethics, Godlee is known for blasting governments for being lax, taking on global pharma giants such as Roche and GlaxoSmithKline for reportedly hiding trial data, speaking fearlessly against corruption in science, and championing the cause of patient-centric healthcare. In India to attend the BMJ South Asia Awards 2016, Godlee talks to Economic Times on a wide range of issues, from air pollution to corruption in medicine and the work that the BMJ does in the country. Edited excerpts: How does it feel to breathe the most polluted air in India? (Laughs) I love this country. It's a wonderful place and am coming back here after two years. The air now looks a lot better from what I read and saw a few days back. To look at the positive side of things, air pollution is back on the agenda of the people. You have to make the public aware and the governments accountable for moving us away from burning fossil fuel. Your recent report reveals that most of the people with diabetes in India are largely dependent on foreign-made insulin, which is expensive… There are certain things which are not going right. To put patients on insulin is a big push by industry and the doctors who in turn are influenced by the industry. Rather than tackling the lifestyle issues, going straight to insulin is not the right option. That is a big worry because insulin is not without its harm and is expensive in India. I think it's a medical scam, an industry scam. Patients think that this is the best drug for them, and they need to pay for it or else they would die, and a very big group of people are vulnerable to it. I think we need to speak out against the pressure to put people on insulin. With diabetes becoming such an epidemic in India, we need to look at the root causes and put money there rather than putting people on insulin. Is there a parallel in terms of rising caesarean births in India rather than normal delivery? Caesarean births are a problem globally, and not just in India. It's more convenient for the doctor, who also gets paid more, and people are encouraged to think it's safer. In some cases, it may be true but not in all cases. It's not a riskfree procedure: anaesthetics, surgery, medical cost, long time of recovery and even more difficulty in having subsequent babies. It's a global issue. What's your take on corruption in medicine? Again, it is a global phenomenon, not just confined to India. There's corruption in medicine globally. But if you have a system where doctors are paid more to do more, then you are going to end up with a system which seems to reward that kind of behaviour. If so, then it's going to get much more likely that doctors would tend to push more for surgery, for investigations… kickbacks encourage more such behaviour. And, on the positive side, there are doctors in India who have started speaking against this. Consumer activism too is missing in India… That may be the case. Consumer activism is a huge potential benefit if we can harness it in a big way. We need to educate people that more is not better, more medicine can be worse. They need to ask questions, take second opinion, ask about the benefits of treatment. The same thing can be done regarding air pollution. Awareness has to be created. Hard questions need to be asked. There needs to be a cultural shift where doctors and patients are much like partners. You first came to India in the early 1990s. In terms of the medical ecosystem, what has changed in India since then? The biggest change is exceptional tertiary care, which even puts the rest of the world to shame. Many countries in the world would be surprised to see the kind of expertise that doctors have here. The second big change is highvolume, high-quality medical care, which is again startling. And what has failed to change? Lack of quality primary care is the biggest concern. With money and energy spent in tertiary medical care, it requires strong political intervention to create infrastructure for primary healthcare. You need to give incentives to young doctors and nurses to work in the primary healthcare system. The pressure that doctors work under has also not changed. Any other medical trend that you have noticed in India? The breakdown of the doctor-patient relationship is disturbing. There have been reports where doctors have been abused and assaulted. It is happening in China as well. There's an unrealistic expectation from medicines and doctors. But there are other issues as well. We are overpromising in terms of offering treatment. Then there are issues about patients taking loans to meet medical expenses. There have been reports of people selling assets and getting bankrupt. These are awful decisions that people have to make. Can drug price control make healthcare more affordable? The government in India has been doing something to bring price control in drug treatment. That's the issue right across the world where drugs are hugely overpriced. Drug companies, for their part, say that they have to recover research and development costs. Since the markup is huge, we need to incentivise drug companies to behave in a different way. The problem of drug pricing is more apparent in India because people are paying themselves.",https://t.co/KzKP8znjvK,others

Your recent report reveals that most of the people with diabetes in India are largely dependent on foreign-made insulin, which is expensive… There are certain things which are not going right. To put patients on insulin is a big push by industry and the doctors who in turn are influenced by the industry. Rather than tackling the lifestyle issues, going straight to insulin is not the right option. That is a big worry because insulin is not without its harm and is expensive in India. I think it's a medical scam, an industry scam. Patients think that this is the best drug for them, and they need to pay for it or else they would die, and a very big group of people are vulnerable to it. I think we need to speak out against the pressure to put people on insulin. With diabetes becoming such an epidemic in India, we need to look at the root causes and put money there rather than putting people on insulin. Is there a parallel in terms of rising caesarean births in India rather than normal delivery? Caesarean births are a problem globally, and not just in India. It's more convenient for the doctor, who also gets paid more, and people are encouraged to think it's safer. In some cases, it may be true but not in all cases. It's not a riskfree procedure: anaesthetics, surgery, medical cost, long time of recovery and even more difficulty in having subsequent babies. It's a global issue. What's your take on corruption in medicine? Again, it is a global phenomenon, not just confined to India. There's corruption in medicine globally. But if you have a system where doctors are paid more to do more, then you are going to end up with a system which seems to reward that kind of behaviour. If so, then it's going to get much more likely that doctors would tend to push more for surgery, for investigations… kickbacks encourage more such behaviour. And, on the positive side, there are doctors in India who have started speaking against this. Consumer activism too is missing in India… That may be the case. Consumer activism is a huge potential benefit if we can harness it in a big way. We need to educate people that more is not better, more medicine can be worse. They need to ask questions, take second opinion, ask about the benefits of treatment. The same thing can be done regarding air pollution. Awareness has to be created. Hard questions need to be asked. There needs to be a cultural shift where doctors and patients are much like partners. You first came to India in the early 1990s. In terms of the medical ecosystem, what has changed in India since then? The biggest change is exceptional tertiary care, which even puts the rest of the world to shame. Many countries in the world would be surprised to see the kind of expertise that doctors have here. The second big change is highvolume, high-quality medical care, which is again startling. And what has failed to change? Lack of quality primary care is the biggest concern. With money and energy spent in tertiary medical care, it requires strong political intervention to create infrastructure for primary healthcare. You need to give incentives to young doctors and nurses to work in the primary healthcare system. The pressure that doctors work under has also not changed. Any other medical trend that you have noticed in India? The breakdown of the doctor-patient relationship is disturbing. There have been reports where doctors have been abused and assaulted. It is happening in China as well. There's an unrealistic expectation from medicines and doctors. But there are other issues as well. We are overpromising in terms of offering treatment. Then there are issues about patients taking loans to meet medical expenses. There have been reports of people selling assets and getting bankrupt. These are awful decisions that people have to make. Can drug price control make healthcare more affordable? The government in India has been doing something to bring price control in drug treatment. That's the issue right across the world where drugs are hugely overpriced. Drug companies, for their part, say that they have to recover research and development costs. Since the markup is huge, we need to incentivise drug companies to behave in a different way. The problem of drug pricing is more apparent in India because people are paying themselves.",https://t.co/NgL5ADnHtK,others

Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy,"AbstractBackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide, but few effective long-term treatments are available. In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.MethodsIn this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to &lt;90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], &gt;300 to 5000) and were treated with renin–angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of &lt;15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.ResultsThe trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. At that time, 4401 patients had undergone randomization, with a median follow-up of 2.62 years. The relative risk of the primary outcome was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.82; P=0.00001). The relative risk of the renal-specific composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the creatinine level, or death from renal causes was lower by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P&lt;0.001), and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was lower by 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.86; P=0.002). The canagliflozin group also had a lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; P=0.01) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of amputation or fracture.ConclusionsIn patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events was lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 2.62 years.

Insurance Company Caps Insulin Copays at $25,"In case you missed the recent headlines: One of the largest insurance companies in the country has made a move to cap copays for insulin at $25 for a month's supply, attempting to broaden access to this life-sustaining medication that's become the poster child for outrageously high drug pricing in America.Share on PinterestAnnounced on April 2, the combined company of Cigna and Express Scripts -- which finalized a $67 billion merger at the end of 2018 -- plans to offer its members in participating plans a Patient Assurance Program that will cap out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, copays, co-insurance) for insulin at $25/month max. The new program will be finalized by year's end for Express Scripts members, and the start of 2020 for Cigna members.This comes at a time of increasing pressure over skyrocketing insulin prices in America, with multiple Congressional hearings underway -- including one today before the Senate Finance Committee with insurers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), and one tomorrow (4/10/19) involving the big three insulin makers being called to testify in front of a House panel. The current Insulin Pricing Crisis is a system-wide issue that has bubbled to the top of public consciousness, and is thankfully now being heatedly discussed at both the federal and state levels. While Cigna and Express Scripts' new $25 copay program is ""only a band-aid"" for certain people who have particular insurance plans that opt in, it is being called ""a step in the right direction"" by vocal advocates who recognize that it will help many people couldn't otherwise afford the insulin they need to survive.We reached out to Cigna/Express Scripts to answer the many questions that come to mind for PWDs (people with diabetes) like us: First off, how many PWDs actually stand to benefit from this?More than 700,000 people enrolled in commercially insured plans across Cigna and Express Scripts had filed a claim for insulin in 2018. So that is the potential population for this program, Cigna says. Many news stories report that the average Cigna/ES member is only paying $41 a month for insulin prior to this program, which is already fairly affordable...?The devil's in the details, of course. Cigna states that for the average Cigna/Express Scripts member, the price of a 30-day supply of insulin is only $41.50, while for those on High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) it's $81/month, and up to $100/month for those on HDHPs in which insulin is not on the preventative drug list where deductibles don't apply.Those amounts may not sound exorbitant, but what they don't take into account is that early in the year, prior to meeting an annual deductible or coinsurance requirement, many people are exposed to high costs and thus unaffordable insulin. So while a copay may hit just $41.50/month at some point late in the year, the truth is that for many months before that happens, the cost is hundreds of dollars higher. So yes, Cigna has some feel-good numbers to share, but they are a bit misleading and don't reflect reality.Cigna says this new Patient Assurance Program will amount to members' annual costs dropping from $1,000 to $250 -- which is meaningful however you slice it. Wait, members will only have to pay $25 -- and not meet their deductible first?Yes, that's correct. For those higher deductible plans, this moves insulin to a ""preventative drug"" category in which the deductible wouldn't apply. Instead, the low copay is available immediately. What insulins are being offered through this program?All three big insulin manufacturers -- Lilly, Novo and Sanofi -- are participating, according to Cigna/ES. We're told they plan to include both short-acting and basal insulins, but a full product list isn't yet available. We were immediately concerned about ""preferred brand"" status that could lead to another ""formulary war"" where drug makers jockey to get better access and lower copays ahead of their competitors, but Cigna insists the program will not have an impact on formulary status. How much insulin do members get for that $25 copay?The cost is $25 for a month's worth of each patient's individual prescription of insulin, whatever amount that may be and whether it's in vials or pen cartridges. Share on Pinterest But what if my Cigna insurance plan requires me to get 90 days of insulin rather than a single month's worth?You will still benefit, Cigna says. The copay for a 90-day supply, whether via mail delivery or retail, will be $75. When does this program begin and end?The powers-that-be tell us they expect it will launch for Express Scripts members before the end of this year, and for Cigna members beginning in 2020. This is not a pilot or trial program, and there's no end-date attached at this time. Why not just lower list prices for all insulins offered through Cigna?That's a separate issue, we're told (and given the convoluted nature of drug pricing including industry rebates and kickbacks, we're not surprised). So how is this being paid for?We wondered whether Cigna Corp. was absorbing the overhead costs. As it turns out, the participating drug makers (Lilly, Novo and Sanofi) are all providing an additional discount applied at the point of sale to push the copay down to $25. Sadly, this doesn't eliminate the issue of established rebates in broader insulin pricing, we're told. How do I know if my employer has signed up to participate in this?""We are not able to just automatically apply it to our clients,"" a Cigna spokeswoman said. ""They have to agree to participate because it's their benefit. We are going to encourage all clients to implement this as a program, and feel confident most will be eager to implement it."" There is no charge to participate, and Cigna assures us that ""most plans"" will not see any additional cost to get the co-payment down to $25 for the patient. Employers interested in participating can learn more about during open enrollment periods (annual insurance discussions when plan designs are evaluated), and are welcome to contact Cigna/ES to find out more. What about Medicare and Medicaid? And those without insurance, or who aren't covered by Cigna plans?To clarify: Sorry Folks, this will not apply to those on federal plans. It's a program specifically offered by Cigna and Express Scripts for their members. Will other insurance companies follow suit?We certainly hope so. When asked for a comment on that, a Cigna spokesperson provided this statement: ""Our job is to provide better care, more choice, and greater affordability. Our Patient Assurance Program offers all three. For customers and members who rely on insulin, Cigna and Express Scripts have found a way to deliver greater affordability and peace of mind to these patients, and we are confident that our new program will remove cost as a barrier for people in participating plans who need insulin. We're also glad the manufacturers are able to work with us to make it happen."" Why is this happening now?Good question. We wondered if it was a direct result of the new federal Health and Human Services (HHS) proposal to eliminate drug rebates... but Cigna says they have been working on this concept ""for a while"" and were finally able to make it materialize following the Cigna/ES merger finalization in December 2018. We still think it's pretty coincidental (and likely planned) that this move comes just as insurers and PBMs are being summoned before Congressional panels over drug and insulin pricing. Right. Isn't this just another PR move to take the heat off payors and other decision-makers on drug pricing?Some may roll their eyes, saying it's only a PR move -- but while there may be truth to that, it still helps.Just like the recently announced half-price Insulin Lispro from Eli Lilly, this is nowhere near a final solution to America's Insulin Pricing Crisis, of course. No one claims it is. But just like with that offer, if one more family can afford the insulin they desperately need, then it's a win for our Diabetes Community.The advocacy doesn't stop here, of course. We continue to cheer on the many insulin pricing advocacy initiatives and efforts to call manufacturers and PBM middle-men to task. Here's to slowly but surely moving the needle on insulin access (no pun intended).",https://t.co/dz6xugsdV6,others
2019 Healthcare Bills,"SB19-228 Prevention of Opioid and Other Substance Use (Winter, Moreno) [Buentello, Singer]AMENDED: ModeratePASSEDShort Description:This bill has 9 components. Component 1 requires certain health care providers who write prescriptions to complete substance use disorder training to renew their license. Component 2 prohibits doctors or physician's assistants from accepting any direct or indirect benefits for prescribing a certain medication. Component 3 requires opioids for outpatient use to have a warning label. Component 4 expands access to the prescription drug monitoring program (used to catch drug seekers) to medical examiners. Component 5 gives $5 $3 million of general fund money to address opioid and other substance abuse priorities. Component 6 gives the legislature a better idea of how much federal money is available/being used for HIV and hepatitis testing and makes sure primary care providers are aware of eligibility requirements. Component 7 creates two grant programs to focus on at-risk youth and their families who have not been successful in seeking aid and creates more state positions to help local communities acquire grants. Component 8 creates and funds a public awareness campaign around safe use, storage and disposal of opioids and availability of antagonist drugs. Component 9 creates pilot programs for detection and intervention for substance use disorder in prenatal and postpartum care.Long Description:Component 1: Requires podiatrists, dentists, advanced practice nurses, optometrists, and veterinarians to complete substance abuse disorder training to renew their license.Component 2: Prohibits doctors or physician's assistants from accepting any direct or indirect benefits for prescribing a certain medication. Specifies that any benefits offered regardless of doctor or physician assistant activity do not apply.Component 3: Requires any prescribed prescription drug for outpatient use that contains opioids to have the following warning label: CAUTION: OPIOID. RISK OF OVERDOSE AND ADDICTION Component 4: Allows medical examiners, if they are investigating a death with suspicious, unnatural or unusual circumstances, to access the dead individual's information in the state's prescription drug monitoring program.Component 5: Grants $5 $3 million of general fund money for addressing opioid and substance use disorders through public health interventions and to work with community partners, including local governments.Component 6: Requires the state to submit amount of federal funds it is receiving or eligible to receive for HIV and hepatitis testing and the number of people currently and anticipated being tested. Also requires the state to prepare materials describing eligibility standards for these tests to be distributed to primary care providers throughout the state.Component 7: Creates two grant programs to create pilot programs with the goal of preventing youth opioid use and supporting youth with family addiction problems. Gives $6 million of general fund money to fund the programs.Component 8: Requires the state center combating substance use disorders to create a public awareness campaign around safe use, storage and disposal of opioids and availability of antagonist drugs (also gives annual $750k to fund the program from the Marijuana tax fund). Campaign and funding go away in 2024. The center must also hire additional staff to help local communities acquire grants.Component 9: Creates multiple pilot programs to address substance use disorder detection and treatment referral (frequently called SBIRT interventions) in prenatal and postpartum care. One program is under the state center combating substance use disorders, which is first required to a statewide assessment to get the most accurate lay of the land, and is in five counties (Alamosa, Boulder, Denver, El Paso, and Pueblo). The state is designated to work with the College of Nursing at the University of Colorado. This program is given $228,000 from the Marijuana cash fund. The College of Nursing is also given another pilot in the same counties to provide training and technical assistance to health care providers. This program is given $172,000 from the Marijuana cash fund. Finally, a pilot is created to integrate substance use disorder and medication assisted treatment with obstetric and gynecological care for three larger facilities and six clinics. Facilities and clinics will apply for grants under the pilot. The bill directs the assembly to give money to the office of behavioral health to run the program but does not specify an amount.Arguments For:While complicated, in essence this bill is about attacking opioid abuse at several critical areas: expanding the numbers of providers who are required to get training (since drug seekers always find the weaknesses in a system), expanding access to the state's prescription drug monitoring program, increasing public awareness through both media and a simple warning label, and providing more resources for at-risk youth and women in the process of having a child. The number of newborns affected by opioid exposure increased 83% from 2010 to 2015 and accidental drug overdose was the leading cause of death among postpartum women from 2004 to 2012. Pilot programs are used here because we are doing something new and when we do something new it is always best to do it small and in multiple different ways at first to figure out what is going to be most effective before potentially wasting millions of dollars (and perhaps some lives) on statewide solutions that may not be the right ones.Arguments Against:This bill needs more muscle behind its goals, while the Legislative Staff is assuming everything gets fully funded (with over $2 million in general fund and marijuana cash fund money that is not specifically mentioned by the bill), there are no guarantees.Pilot programs are nice, but move too slowly. Because this is a crisis, we need to be willing to do some things wrong while moving faster to bring a broader impact across the state.This bill adds a lot of unnecessary red tape to the state's bureaucracy: prescribers that barely interact with people getting opioids, more cumbersome rules for doctors around what they are allowed to accept from drug companies, nanny state labeling requirements, and wasting medical examiner's time by playing detective instead of using the body they have in front of them.Anonymous VoteSign in with WordPress",https://t.co/zlCfznh7PD,others

"Insulin Units and Conversion Factors: A Story of Truth, Boots, and Faster Half-Truths","AbstractConventional insulin concentration units (IU/mL or just U/mL) are bioefficacy based, whereas the Système International (SI) units (pmol/L) are mass based. In converting between these two different approaches, there are at least 2 well-accepted conversion factors, where there should be only 1. The correct value is not the most-used or well-accepted using online calculators, some journal styles, laboratory reports, and published articles. In short, an incorrect insulin conversion factor is widely used which underreports insulin concentrations by ~15%, with potentially significant research and clinical implications. This short commentary describes the history of insulin IU definitions and conversion factors, and highlights the widespread nature of conversion factor misuse, to provoke deeper interest and thought regarding numbers we so often use without thinking.1.Volund, A.

"Eat, Pray, Insulin: Tips for Travelling the World with Type 1 Diabetes","This is a guest post by Cazzy Magennis from Dream Big, Travel Far is about travelling with insulin and other tips on what to carry in your diabetes travel kit.So, you want to travel the world, but you have that stupid chronic illness called type 1 diabetes. Don't worry –I've got you covered.Yes, type 1 diabetes is annoying and over 300,000 Canadians live with T1D. You didn't cause it, and now you've got to deal with it.Unfortunately, travel has a lot of different elements that can cause trouble for our type 1 diabetes, including altitude, new time zones, new climates, new foods, keeping insulin refrigerated –and I'm just getting started.To help ease the burden of traveling with type 1 diabetes, I've put together some of my top tips for traveling with insulin and everything that goes along with it.I've been to over 30 countries with my type 1 diabetes and it's true that with a little planning and common sense, you can have just as much fun as your non-diabetic counterparts!Step 1: Gather Your SuppliesRegardless of the length of your trip, you are going to need adequate supplies. As a rule, I always suggest bringing 3 times as much as you need for the duration of your trip.So, for example, if I need 5 bottles of insulin, 15 infusion sets, 5 insulin pens, 10 reservoirs, 5 boxes of test strips, then I am going to bring three times as much.Why? Because type 1 diabetes is so unpredictable.Travelling with InsulinYour insulin could die in the heat (more on that later), your diabetic supplies could be stolen, misplaced or damaged, or you could be caught in a national disaster (yes, seriously.) The reality is, if you don't have insulin, you will die, so it's important to take more than you need to prepare for every scenario.In some countries, it's difficult to obtain more insulin than you need for a trip. However, most insurance companies will allow you to request more supplies if you explain you are heading off on a trip, OR you can source the cheapest place to gain insulin in the countries you are visiting.Step 2: Keep Your Insulin Cool While TravellingAs mentioned, insulin keeps you alive, so if it's not working, then we can't travel. Your insulin is going to be going on long-haul flights and long-haul bus journeys. It's going to experience hot climates, cold climates, and high altitudes. Therefore, it needs protecting. In order for insulin to work, it needs to be kept at a cool temperature.The use of Frio bags or similar insulin travel cases will help keep your insulin at the required temperature for the full duration of your trip. Thus, ensuring you can use it.You will know your insulin has ""died"" if it's gone a cloudy white colour. Under NO circumstances should you use insulin that has died.Related: International Health Insurance Review: A Guide to Nomad InsuranceStep 3: Learn to Carbohydrate CountIf you are on an insulin pump, you will already know how to carb count because it's part of the training.But, if you are on insulin pens, then perhaps you haven't mastered the skill yet. When we inject insulin, the amount of insulin we require is based on the carbohydrates of a food –not sugar, fat, salt, etc.The carb counting method allows you to count carbs and work out your insulin dose based on ""carb ratios.For example, my carb ratio is: 8g=1 unit of insulin. What this means is that for every 8g of carbs, I take 1 unit of insulin.Once you've learned the correct ratio, it means your blood sugars will stay within range. Carb counting can be self-taught, or you can take a course. You should ask your local healthcare professional for more info on this.Traveling with diabetes means new foods, and you guessed it –new carbs! This means you are going to need to calculate the insulin you need for foods you've never tried before. There are a few things to help with this.Get yourself a ""Carbs &amp; Cals book or app, or download MyFitnessPal.The ""Carbs &amp; Cals"" book will give you a visual representation of carb portions and a suggested carbohydrate range, and the app will do the same.This means if you see or try a new food, you can take an estimated carb count. Learning to count carbs is essential for travelling with diabetes.Step 4: Get Yourself a Doctors NoteWhether you have to pay for a doctors letter (you really shouldn't!), or not, it's really important to have one from your diabetes consultant. This document will explain that you are type 1 diabetic, that you will carry insulin and diabetic supplies and most importantly if you are on an insulin pump.Bear in mind that your insulin pump cannot go through the body scanners in airports. (Overarch x-rays are fine). You can ask for an alternative pat-down and for them to swipe your pump for explosives.Doctors letters aren't just useful for airports, they are also useful for border control and spot checks in tourist destinations. For example, in the Eiffel tower, you may need a doctors letter explaining your insulin pump (there is the famous story of the boy who was denied).Also, at the border control in Vietnam I had a very confused police officer thinking I was transporting drugs until I gave him my doctors letter. This leads onto an important tip;Translate your doctor's letter into the language of the chosen country. Most people will not have a clue what diabetes is at all, so say more simple words like ""insulin, insulin, and if all else fails, say the word ""sick. Honestly, it can be frustrating, but just be prepared and you will be fine.Step 5: Wear Some Diabetic IDWhen you are traveling in a new country, where the locals don't speak your language, it's important you have some form of medical identification.You can get cute bracelets, phone charms, necklaces or temporary tattoos (if that's your thing). It's also a good idea to put your lock screen on your phone to something like ""If I am passed out, call an ambulance, I am diabetic –in the language of the country you are in.Don't be afraid to tell people about your type 1 diabetes. Use it as an opportunity to educate and inform. I know how frustrating it is for someone to think you've got an illness because you ate too much sugar, but help break the misconceptions by telling your story.Everyone I've met has been super interested to learn about my illness, and surprised that they didn't know about it! I have yet to meet another type 1 diabetic on my travels, but I know they are out there, so hopefully one day!For more tips on traveling with diabetes, you can check out my blog or eBook! Diabetes doesn't hold me back, and it shouldn't hold you back either!VIDEO",https://t.co/VMa9NS8Zji,others
The power of a good walk.,"I walk a lot. Usually after meals; sometimes for sunlight &amp; exercise, other times just because it's a habit and I like doing it. Sometimes even twice a day (eg, after breakfast and lunch).But seriously, it's way healthier than I thought. This has been in-and-out of the news a few times over the years, but I was always like, ""duh,"" until I finally looked at the data. In some cases glucose &amp; insulin excursions are down 20, 30, even 50%! (mostly depending on distance covered, but also speed) (but mostly distance).LOL there are like, a million studies titled ""breaking up prolonged sitting improves everything"" hahaAnd since the effects are acute, a lot of well-controlled RCTs -- the flipside of that is you have to do it every day... my opinion is that total glycemic exposure over the course of your life is an important metric (more on the MOA below); and with the rise of continuous glucose monitoring systems, this will be proven true.Exhibit A. The biggest intervention (VERY long walks, 5-6 hrs/d), but most profound results (Manohar et al., 2012)Exhibit B. Prolonged sitting vs. a 30-minute walk vs. 1.5 minutes walking every 30 minutes throughout the day (Peddie et al., 2013). Both of these interventions are very doable, imo.In this study, the total daily glycemic exposure was 49, 47, and 30 mM / 9 h. 90 seconds of walking every 30 minutes cut glucose by almost half. HALF. Insulin also dropped precipitously. If you work a sedentary job, MAKE TIME FOR THIS. EVERY DAY. GO NOW.Exhibit C. Sitting vs. 1 hour of continuous walking vs. 1 hour of alternating slow and fast walking (Karstoft et al., 2014).Tl;dr: glucose dropped by about 20 points in both walking groups, insulin was almost halved.Exhibit D. Sitting vs. 3 minutes walking every 30 minutes vs. 3 minutes of easy body weight exercises every 30 minutes (Dempsey et al., 2016).BOOMHOW?It works in healthy people, type 1 diabetic patients, and type 2's... I haven't seen an example where it didn't work.Here's the magic. Exercise suppresses insulin via sympathetic nervous system. This doesn't matter because a contracting muscle, or rather the contraction itself, recruits GLUT4 to the surface of contracting muscle to suck up glucose, to fuel the contraction. It doesn't need insulin to do this. Glucose-lowering this way also contributes to reduced need for insulin. This is a very healthy thing.That's all for now!Consults are open.

Key House oversight panel to investigate rising cost of insulin,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), chair of the House oversight panel that's currently investigating the rising cost of insulin, announced today that her committee will hold its first of two hearings on the skyrocketing cost of the drug next Tuesday, April 2, at 10:30 a.m. ET.DeGette made the announcement while speaking at a health care policy summit on Tuesday where she told the crowd that her panel will hold two formal hearings this month to determine what Congress can do to make the life-saving drug more accessible to the millions of Americans who rely on it to survive.""The insulin pricing issue is a microcosm of what's going on throughout the prescription drug area,"" DeGette said. ""This is a drug that's been around for nearly one hundred years but, for some reason, has more than doubled in price over the last decade. In holding these hearings, we want to know what's going on and what Congress can do to help bring down the cost of this drug for the millions of Americans who need it to survive.""More than seven million Americans rely on insulin to maintain their blood sugar, but the steadily increasing price of the drug – which has more than doubled in recent years – has made it unaffordable for some patients who are now forced to take drastic steps, such as rationing their medication, in order to survive.DeGette, who has long been a leading advocate for Americans with diabetes, serves not only as chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations panel, but also as co-chair of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus.In her role as co-chair of the Diabetes Caucus, DeGette launched a bipartisan inquiry into the rising cost of insulin last year to determine what Congress could do to make it more affordable for consumers.That inquiry led DeGette to release a bipartisan report in November that contained several policy recommendations for Congress to focus on in trying to combat the rising price of the drug – including, increasing competition among drug manufacturers, creating a standardized system for consumers to appeal an insurer's decision to deny coverage, and allowing consumers to pay the same price that wholesalers and pharmacies pay for certain drugs.Earlier this year, just weeks after taking over as the new chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel, DeGette sent letters to the heads of Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi – the three top manufactures of insulin in the U.S. – asking them to explain the rapidly increasing cost of insulin and why they are not providing a more affordable treatment to patients in need.DeGette plans to use the responses she received from those three drug makers as the foundation for the upcoming hearings.Next Tuesday's hearing, which will begin at 10:30 a.m. EST, will take place in room 2322 of the Rayburn House Office Building. A full list of the witnesses who will be testifying at the hearing will be released later this week. While a date for the second hearing has not yet been confirmed, it will be in April.Copies of the letters DeGette sent to the three manufacturers of insulin are available here.A copy of the bipartisan report DeGette released in Nov. 2018 is available here.",https://t.co/mA2bPeLHHL,others

Dr. Berg's Healthy Keto Basics: START HERE,"Take Dr. Berg's Free Keto Mini-Course: http://pxlme.me/-i717vtY or go here: https://bit.ly/2JbISDoDownload Keto Essentialshttp://bit.ly/2DH0d6oIf you are new to Dr. Berg's channel, this is the first video to watch. Dr. Berg talks about the basics of healthy Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting. What is Keto or Ketosis? • Keto means fat burning• When you burn fat, the fat breaks down into what's called Ketones where the body can use it as an alternative fuel, a much better fuel-source than sugar fuel. • Healthy Ketosis is a version of regular ketosis based on a principle where you have to ""Get healthy first, then lose the weight."" And ""get healthy"" means related to eating healthy high quality foods that is providing all of your nutrients. What is Intermittent Fasting? • It is a pattern of eating and not eating. Instead of doing 3-6 meals a day and snacking, you are eating less frequently because every time you eat you raise the hormone called Insulin. How to Lower Insulin? • Less to Zero Carbohydrates – Sugar, refined carbs, grains, pasta, cereal, biscuits, juice, alcohol, etc. • Less frequent mealsHigh Insulin Symptoms• Belly Fat • High Blood Pressure • High Cholesterol • Fatigue (especially after eating)• Decrease Cognitive Function, Lack of Focus, Poor Memory • Moody, irritable, depressed, grouchy • Cravings• Hungry all the time (especially in between meals)Benefits of Keto and Intermittent Fasting• Weight loss • Reducing Inflammation • Cognitive Function • Overall mood • Making the body work better Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 52 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.

Bronx Connections: The Health Impact,"By THERESA SCHLIEPAt $1200 a Month, Managing Diabetes Puts a Dent on Bronx Family's BudgetELIZABETH CABRAL AND her mother Elbia inside their Highbridge home. Elbia holdsseveral packs of insulin Elizabeth regularly takes.The Norwood News, WFUV Radio, and BronxNet Television present a five-part series on health-related struggles affecting residents of the Bronx. Elbia Cabral of Highbridge knows a lot about insulin. She knows the different kinds of long-acting and short-lasting insulin, the cheap brands, and the pricier brands. It's been a year and a half since 12-year-old Elizabeth was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. And it's been an adjustment for the whole family.Now, Elbia worries about her daughter's health, and has plenty of questions on her management. ""[I]s she going to be doing her insulin herself?"" asked Elbia, wondering if her daughter will forget her insulin pen if she goes out with friends. Elizabeth has since gotten used to monitoring her blood sugar and pricking her finger.As an added way of ensuring she stays healthy, the family adopted a diabetes assist dog, Flower, who can smell scents in Elizabeth's blood sugar. They've also had to adjust their lives to afford the insulin and medication Elizabeth needs. At around $1200 a month, or $14,400 a year, her care competes with the price of rent in some neighborhoods. So, the family downsized and cut corners. They moved out of their own apartment into their immediate family's apartment to save on rent. Elizabeth dropped tennis, piano lessons and cheerleading; she didn't mind the piano lessons or tennis, but does miss cheerleading. And Elbia perused eBay for cheaper testing strips.""We overused our credit cards in the beginning. That was the only way,"" said Elbia. ""So we ended up with a lot of debt for something that wasn't her fault, not our fault, nobody's fault. But there we were."" Insulin prices have gone up dramatically over the past decade. According to a report from a working group with the American Diabetes Association, insulin prices tripled from 2002 to 2013.And they've doubled again since then. Back when Elizabeth was diagnosed, she didn't have health insurance. The family paid roughly $4000 a month for all of her supplies. Elizabeth has health insurance now, and Elbia said she's grateful for the coverage. But even with the insurance—covering long- and short-acting insulin, lancets, testing strips, pumps, alcohol, lotions— the price of staying healthy is quite expensive. Elbia said this monthly expenditure has caused the family financial stress.""It's frustrating. I was at a point where I was like, 'you know what, I can't,'"" she said. She ended up taking a personal leave from work for three months. The Cabrals aren't alone. She knows other Bronx parents of diabetics who have to reuse testing strips, or even ration their insulin. A report in the Journal of the American Medicine Association Internal Medicine shows as many as one in four with diabetes in the United States have rationed their insulin.Julianne Dimaio says she's seen diabetics struggle to afford insulin and other medications. She's the Diabetes Clinical Program Manager for the Institute for Family Health. They have offices throughout New York City and operate Bronx Health REACH, working to combat health disparities in black and Latino communities.Dimaio and her team work to help patients navigate diabetes and managing their health. But she said it can be tricky for patients to get what they need. ""There are all these roadblocks for the patient to pick up the insulin, that then the office has to deal with,"" she said. ""Meanwhile, the poor patient who wants to take the insulin and needs it, can't get it."" There are serious repercussions for those who do not or cannot take care of their diabetes. Type 2 diabetics who mismanage their treatment in the long-term frequently develop kidney, eyesight, and heart problems. This mismanagement can be the result of inaccessible treatment.VIDEOOne deadly consequence of insufficient insulin in the body is diabetic ketoacidosis, when acid builds up in the bloodstream and the body essentially shuts down. The Bronx has some of the highest rates of diabetes in the country.According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 16 percent of Bronx residents have been diagnosed with diabetes. Most people with diabetes in the borough have Type 2, which is less insulin dependent but still requires routine maintenance and blood sugar testing.Elbia said navigating health insurance policies makes managing diabetes even more difficult. She argues with representatives on the phone to get more insulin and other supplies because their insurance company underestimates what Elizabeth needs every month. Elizabeth has changed her insulin three different times to keep up with what her insurance company prefers.""I don't think parents like to say how hard it is to have a child with diabetes, but it goes beyond what anyone can imagine,"" she said. ""Having the right access to medication makes things better. It's not easy if you're running out of medication.""Some in Washington D.C. are concerned about the rising cost of insulin. The Congressional Diabetes Caucus has suggested a number of legislative actions to improve price transparency and promote competition amongst the producers of insulin. Minnesota filed a lawsuit last year against the three main producers of insulin for ""deceptive"" price hikes. For now, many people with diabetes struggle to pay for the medication they need.Elbia says lower insulin prices are crucial to improving the lives of those living with diabetes. ""The way the rules are laid down are not humane,"" said Elbia. ""Here is a parent with a child who has been given a lifelong diagnosis that now has to become a lawyer and fight back everyone to get what should already be given to these kids.""",https://t.co/DxlgDeaali,others
High-Tech Insulin Is More Problem Than Solution,"Insulin has been with us for decades. Photographer: Douglas Grundy/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Photographer: Douglas Grundy/Hulton Archive/Getty Images The researchers who pioneered insulin injections for diabetes sufferers in 1922 were dedicated to making the life-saving treatment widely available, and gave away their rights to profit from the discovery. Yet almost a century later, the medicine is still beyond the reach of roughly half of the 100 million people around the world who need it. Governments should be asking why, and doing something to put this right.Insulin is still expensive because the three major producers — Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi — have been granted patents on the drug as they have incrementally changed it. First they derived the hormone from animals, then from humans, and most recently from recombinant DNA techniques. With each small advance, the price has gone up. The advanced formulations are meant to work faster or longer, but they've been shown to offer little or no advantage over the basic alternatives. Yet they cost nearly six times as much. On average, patients pay less than $8 a vial for human insulin, and $45 a vial for the analogs. Nevertheless, in developed countries, doctors are widely prescribing analog insulin. In the U.K., analog insulin now accounts for three-quarters of the total supply, up from just 11 percent in 2000. A similar shift in the U.S. has tripled the annual insulin bill since 2002, to $15 billion. Switching Scripts Human insulins account for less than 10% of U.S. insulin prescriptions, down from 22% in 2009. Source: Bloomberg data Unfortunately, many doctors in low- and middle-income countries have done the same. The World Health Organization has declared that the cost of high-tech insulin outweighs its potential benefit, because governments cannot afford enough of it for all the people who need it. In Iran, where 5 million people have diabetes, buying analogs rather than human insulin costs the government an extra $49 million a year — money that could be used instead to more widely diagnose and treat the disease. (An estimated 35 percent of diabetes cases in Iran remain undiagnosed.)In sub-Saharan Africa, only 40 percent of countries provide insulin of any kind at public hospitals and clinics. Children born in the least developed of these countries who have type 1 diabetes have a life expectancy of less than one year.Governments could save money by purchasing only simple human insulin from smaller drug companies, but they have been reluctant to challenge the big three in the face of the companies' vigorous marketing.As a first step, they should arrange for competitive bidding. Nine countries in the Caribbean have collectively saved money on insulin in this way. Governments can lower prices further by reducing their own taxes and customs duties on imported insulin. They should also try to encourage drug companies to create cheaper copies of branded insulins, as patents on existing medicines expire over the next five to 10 years. Here, the WHO could help by creating a prequalification process to vet potential competitors and guide national regulators as they evaluate and approve new products.Also needed in many countries are coordinated efforts to better distribute insulin to avoid the kind of unnecessary regional shortages that force people to buy higher-priced drugs from private retailers.The world's shortage of insulin, with all the harm it causes, is an avoidable problem. Closer attention to value for money could ensure an adequate supply of affordable insulin to treat everyone with diabetes worldwide.(Corrects description of children in sub-Saharan Africa with type 1 diabetes, in seventh paragraph of article published June 7.)—Editors: Jason Gale, Mary Duenwald.To contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg View's editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net .",https://t.co/loDJ5zCN84,others
Pushing diabetics to take insulin is a medical scam: Fiona Godlee,"Fiona Godlee, the first woman editor of the BMJ (originally called the British Medical Journal), is no ivory-tower academic. A crusader for medical ethics, Godlee is known for blasting governments for being lax, taking on global pharma giants such as Roche and GlaxoSmithKline for reportedly hiding trial data, speaking fearlessly against corruption in science, and championing the cause of patient-centric healthcare. In India to attend the BMJ South Asia Awards 2016, Godlee talks to Economic Times on a wide range of issues, from air pollution to corruption in medicine and the work that the BMJ does in the country. Edited excerpts: How does it feel to breathe the most polluted air in India? (Laughs) I love this country. It's a wonderful place and am coming back here after two years. The air now looks a lot better from what I read and saw a few days back. To look at the positive side of things, air pollution is back on the agenda of the people. You have to make the public aware and the governments accountable for moving us away from burning fossil fuel. Your recent report reveals that most of the people with diabetes in India are largely dependent on foreign-made insulin, which is expensive… There are certain things which are not going right. To put patients on insulin is a big push by industry and the doctors who in turn are influenced by the industry. Rather than tackling the lifestyle issues, going straight to insulin is not the right option. That is a big worry because insulin is not without its harm and is expensive in India. I think it's a medical scam, an industry scam. Patients think that this is the best drug for them, and they need to pay for it or else they would die, and a very big group of people are vulnerable to it. I think we need to speak out against the pressure to put people on insulin. With diabetes becoming such an epidemic in India, we need to look at the root causes and put money there rather than putting people on insulin. Is there a parallel in terms of rising caesarean births in India rather than normal delivery? Caesarean births are a problem globally, and not just in India. It's more convenient for the doctor, who also gets paid more, and people are encouraged to think it's safer. In some cases, it may be true but not in all cases. It's not a riskfree procedure: anaesthetics, surgery, medical cost, long time of recovery and even more difficulty in having subsequent babies. It's a global issue. What's your take on corruption in medicine? Again, it is a global phenomenon, not just confined to India. There's corruption in medicine globally. But if you have a system where doctors are paid more to do more, then you are going to end up with a system which seems to reward that kind of behaviour. If so, then it's going to get much more likely that doctors would tend to push more for surgery, for investigations… kickbacks encourage more such behaviour. And, on the positive side, there are doctors in India who have started speaking against this. Consumer activism too is missing in India… That may be the case. Consumer activism is a huge potential benefit if we can harness it in a big way. We need to educate people that more is not better, more medicine can be worse. They need to ask questions, take second opinion, ask about the benefits of treatment. The same thing can be done regarding air pollution. Awareness has to be created. Hard questions need to be asked. There needs to be a cultural shift where doctors and patients are much like partners. You first came to India in the early 1990s. In terms of the medical ecosystem, what has changed in India since then? The biggest change is exceptional tertiary care, which even puts the rest of the world to shame. Many countries in the world would be surprised to see the kind of expertise that doctors have here. The second big change is highvolume, high-quality medical care, which is again startling. And what has failed to change? Lack of quality primary care is the biggest concern. With money and energy spent in tertiary medical care, it requires strong political intervention to create infrastructure for primary healthcare. You need to give incentives to young doctors and nurses to work in the primary healthcare system. The pressure that doctors work under has also not changed. Any other medical trend that you have noticed in India? The breakdown of the doctor-patient relationship is disturbing. There have been reports where doctors have been abused and assaulted. It is happening in China as well. There's an unrealistic expectation from medicines and doctors. But there are other issues as well. We are overpromising in terms of offering treatment. Then there are issues about patients taking loans to meet medical expenses. There have been reports of people selling assets and getting bankrupt. These are awful decisions that people have to make. Can drug price control make healthcare more affordable? The government in India has been doing something to bring price control in drug treatment. That's the issue right across the world where drugs are hugely overpriced. Drug companies, for their part, say that they have to recover research and development costs. Since the markup is huge, we need to incentivise drug companies to behave in a different way. The problem of drug pricing is more apparent in India because people are paying themselves.",https://t.co/K5tHlWx7GS,others
Efficacy of ketogenic diet on body composition during resistance training in trained men: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Ketogenic diets (KD) have become a popular method of promoting weight loss. More recently, some have recommended that athletes adhere to ketogenic diets in order to optimize changes in body composition during training. This study evaluated the efficacy of an 8-week ketogenic diet (KD) during energy surplus and resistance training (RT) protocol on body composition in trained men.METHODS: Twenty-four healthy men (age 30 ± 4.7 years; weight 76.7 ± 8.2 kg; height 174.3 ± 19.7 cm) performed an 8-week RT program. Participants were randomly assigned to a KD group (n = 9), non-KD group (n = 10, NKD), and control group (n = 5, CG) in hyperenergetic condition. Body composition changes were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Compliance with the ketosis state was monitored by measuring urinary ketones weekly. Data were analyzed using a univariate, multivariate and repeated measures general linear model (GLM) statistics.RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in fat mass (mean change, 95% CI; p-value; Cohen's d effect size [ES]; - 0.8 [- 1.6, - 0.1] kg; p &lt; 0.05; ES = - 0.46) and visceral adipose tissue (- 96.5 [- 159.0, - 34.0] g; p &lt; 0.05; ES = - 0.84), while no significant changes were observed in the NKD and CG in fat mass (- 0,5 [- 1.2, 0.3] kg; p &gt; 0.05; ES = - 0.17 and - 0,5 [- 2.4, 1.3] kg; p &gt; 0.05; ES = - 0.12, respectively) or visceral adipose tissue (- 33.8 [- 90.4, 22.8]; p &gt; 0.5; ES = - 0.17 and 1.7 [- 133.3, 136.7]; p &gt; 0.05; ES = 0.01, respectively). No significant increases were observed in total body weight (- 0.9 [- 2.3, 0.6]; p &gt; 0.05; ES = [- 0.18]) and muscle mass (- 0.1 [- 1.1,1.0]; p &gt; 0,05; ES = - 0.04) in the KD group, but the NKD group showed increases in these parameters (0.9 [0.3, 1.5] kg; p &lt; 0.05; ES = 0.18 and (1.3[0.5, 2.2] kg; p &lt; 0,05; ES = 0.31, respectively). There were no changes neither in total body weight nor lean body mass (0.3 [- 1.2, 1.9]; p &gt; 0.05; ES = 0.05 and 0.8 [- 0.4, 2.1]; p &gt; 0.05; ES = 0.26, respectively) in the CG.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a KD might be an alternative dietary approach to decrease fat mass and visceral adipose tissue without decreasing lean body mass; however, it might not be useful to increase muscle mass during positive energy balance in men undergoing RT for 8 weeks.",https://t.co/jT8H5wP9Oc,others

"Visiting Mexico, asking strangers: Diabetics scramble for costly insulin","Mike Lawson will never forget how he ended up in the hospital 12 years ago when he had to decide between making a $300 car payment or buying insulin. ""I made a stupid choice,"" said Lawson, an Oakland resident who has Type 1 diabetes. ""That month I chose to pay for my car payment and to ration insulin."" These days, the price of insulin skyrocketing, and he is stockpiling the drug. Through Twitter, Lawson recently connected with a stranger who said she had four leftover bottles after switching brands. The two exchanged messages and met near her San Francisco office. Letting insulin go to waste ""is almost like tossing gold,"" Lawson said. The price of three commonly used insulin products has increased substantially in recent years. From 2013 to 2019, the cost of NovoLog nearly doubled, going from $289 to $540 per carton, according to according to letters sent in February to drug manufacturers by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating insulin prices. Another common drug, Lantus, rose in price from $244 to $431, the committee said. (The drug's maker, Sanofi, says the numbers rose from $228 to $425 over that time period, but the amount paid to the company actually fell 25% after Sanofi paid rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.) A vial of Humalog, a third popular insulin drug, cost $35 in 2001 and by 2015 had risen to $234, according to the Senate committee. And so, worried about cost, diabetics such as Lawson are increasingly seeking new ways to get, give away or exchange insulin cheaply or for free. Some are using unofficial channels on the internet. Others are traveling to Mexico, where pharmacies sell some popular types of insulin for a fraction of their cost in the United States. Lawson, who now is able to get insulin for a moderate price through insurance even though he still seeks out extra, has also given away some of his insulin to local strangers in need, who find him through Twitter by searching hashtags like #T1D (Type 1 diabetes) and #insulin4all. For the roughly 1.5 million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, the amount of money patients spent on insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $240 to $475 a month, according to a January report from the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care data. And spending in 2017 continued to rise, experts said. ""The risk isn't only that people are being trapped in debt,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, tweeted last weekend. ""Americans have actually died from diabetic ketoacidosis because they had to ration or skip their doses. We need to rein in Big Pharma greed to save lives."" Many stories have emerged nationwide about people who, like Lawson, rationed or delayed buying insulin because they could not afford it, often leading to deadly and dangerous results. About 1 in 4 diabetes patients uses less insulin than prescribed because of costs, according to a 2018 Yale University study. ""It's not just anecdotal, this is relatively widespread,"" said the study co-author Dr. Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. ""There are lots of patients having difficulty affording their insulin."" But why is insulin, which is naturally produced by the pancreas and first discovered for medical use nearly a century ago, so expensive? The scientists who invented it in 1923 sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto for the purpose of making it accessible. But the way the drug is produced and delivered to the body has changed significantly since then. Insulin was initially isolated from animal pancreases, but today it is made by inserting the human insulin gene into bacteria, producing the insulin protein, and then purifying it. Insulin is derived from live organisms and put through a complex process to become a medicine — so it's hard for a competing drug company to make a generic version of it. A handful of drug manufacturers have essentially patented the processes for creating modern-day insulin products just enough to keep exclusive patents under their name, experts said. Only three drug companies sell insulin in the United States: Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk. ""Some of the insulins have dozens of patents on them even though the active ingredient patent has expired,"" said Jeannie Biniek, a health economist who co-wrote the Health Care Cost Institute report. ""There's a question of whether these additional patents are providing a justified return on the investment or, if at some point, they are just providing the company the opportunity to maintain a monopoly on the market."" And, as is the case with many prescription drugs, it's not clear how the ""list price"" of insulin — what a patient would have to pay out of pocket for it, if they do not have insurance — is determined because negotiations between drug companies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers about who pays what are considered proprietary. Drug companies say lowering the list price wouldn't necessarily lead to lower costs for consumers because part of the list price gets paid to pharmacy benefit managers. In recent weeks, amid growing pressure from Congress, the drug companies and some insurers have announced plans to make insulin more affordable. But they fall short of many consumers' expectations. Eli Lilly, which makes Humalog, announced in March it will offer a half-price version of the popular fast-acting insulin for $137 per vial, but has not said when it will be available. A Lilly spokesman said the company also offers a free hotline that consumers can call for information about out-of-pocket reductions at the pharmacy and clinics where donated insulin is available. In April, hours before Sanofi executives were set to testify before a congressional committee on rising insulin prices, the company announced it will sell its insulin products for a fixed price of $99 a month, for up to 10 vials or boxes of insulin pens, to patients paying with cash. Patients who have commercial health insurance are eligible for co-pay cards that may lower their out-of-pocket expenses, a Sanofi spokesman said. Last year, 246,000 people used the co-pay cards and paid nothing or $10 a month for their Sanofi insulin, he said. Sanofi also provides free insulin for low-income uninsured patients who make about $30,000 a year or less. Novo Nordisk has provided free insulin to tens of thousands of uninsured people with diabetes since 2003 and spends $200 million each year on co-pay assistance to patients with commercial health plans. ""We know how challenging it is for a growing number of Americans with diabetes to afford their medicines, including the ones we make,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesman said. ""As a company focused on improving the lives of people with diabetes, this is not acceptable."" Cigna and Express Scripts, which recently merged, announced that they would cap out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $25 a month for patients whose pharmacy plans are managed by Express Scripts. Up to 700,000 people who are on employer-sponsored plans are eligible to receive this benefit if their employer decides to opt in. ""I'm glad to see the mounting pressure and public outcry are having an impact in Lilly releasing this generic and Cigna capping spending, but that's not enough,"" said Lipska, of Yale. ""Those are Band-Aid solutions that don't resolve the underlying issue of very high prices for these insulins."" Indeed, the discount and savings programs aren't reaching everyone. Sabella Larkin of San Diego said she has had to buy insulin in Mexico three times — once in Tijuana and twice in Rosarito. The first time was several years ago, when she was a college student in Texas, while working full time at a tanning salon and struggling to pay her bills. Her insurance at the time wouldn't cover an insulin refill until a certain date, and she couldn't wait. One of her customers at the salon lent her $200 to buy an insulin pen. ""Two weeks later when I got paid, I tried to reimburse her and she said no,"" said Larkin, 28. ""Being in that situation, that's when I went to Mexico and happened to see the insulin I take. It was only $20. I literally cried."" Larkin said she has purchased both NovoLog and Lantus in Mexico for $20 to $25, for the same amount of insulin that would have cost her hundreds of dollars at U.S. pharmacies. ""It was life changing,"" she said. ""It was this added security across the border."" Catherine Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

PCOS and insulin resistance,"What is the connection between PCOS and insulin resistance? What are the three criteria for PCOS, and why do some women develop too much testosterone? And why do patients put on a low-carb diet for other reasons than infertility, have a higher pregnancy rate?In this presentation from the Low Carb Denver 2019 conference, Drs. Nadia Pateguana and Jason Fung talks about PCOS and insulin resistance.This is our #10 published presentation from the Low Carb Denver conference. We've previously posted the presentations by Gary Taubes, Dr. Andreas Eenfeldt, Dr. Sarah Hallberg, Dr. David Ludwig, Dr. Ben Bikman, Dr. Paul Mason, Dr. Priyanka Wali, Dr. Caryn Zinn and Dr. Eric Westman.Transcript of the preview aboveDr. Jason Fung: Everything here is really a disease of too much insulin. And this is the part that sort of logic just breaks down. Because in medical school you learn about all this stuff and it's like okay well if too much insulin causes everything that you see in PCOS, then what's the treatment? How about Clomid? Is like… Did you not pay attention here? Too much insulin was the problem. Why are you giving Clomid which stimulates the ovary to ovulate? It's like… how about an ovarian wedge resection? It's like… What? What are you talking about? So ovarian wedge resection was this sort of old-time treatment for PCOS where they'd actually slice a little wedge, you know, like a little piece of watermelon out of your ovary and that was the treatment for PCOS. And why did it work? Because if you slice a little wedge of your ovary, your ovary cannot produce as much of the testosterone. So a lot of the symptoms would get better but, again, you're not making the actual disease better. Because you never actually treated the hyperinsulinemia. Or you can go to other treatments like… Metformin sort of makes little sense… But how about birth control pills? Is like, is that going to reduce your insulin? If it doesn't, then what are you doing for this disease?Like you got to go back to the root cause of the disease and fix it if you want to fix this disease. And the disease is so common and causes so much heart ache that– We treat it in this crazy manner when we already know what the root cause of this disease is. It's like it's too much insulin, so let's produce insulin.TranscriptWatch a part of our presentation above.

Exercise and Diabetes,"The information is intended to inform and educate and is not a replacement for medical evaluation, advice, diagnosis or treatment by a healthcare professional.Based on guidelines provided by the American College of Sports Medicine.Condition Overview:Type two diabetes is a chronic condition characterised by a relative deficiency of insulin, resulting in an inability to control blood glucose levels – hyperglycaemia. This relative deficiency may be caused by insulin resistance in the muscle cells, or defective insulin secretion by the pancreas.The process leading to type two diabetes is complex, and can involve the following steps:Increased levels of fat in blood.Muscle resistant to insulin (takes glucose out of blood).Liver produces more insulin to compensate.Too much insulin becomes toxic.Body unable to produce further insulin.Lose ability to control blood sugar levels.As apparent in the first step in this process, obesity is highly linked with type two diabetes, and the conditions often occur simultaneously.Short Term Response to Exercise:Due to the imbalance between glucose production and utilisation exercise can lead to an impaired ability to control blood glucose levels. Short term effects on the exercise response are determined by the following:Blood glucose lowering medication.Timing of medication.Pre-exercise blood glucose levels.Pre, during and post exercise nutritional intake.Presence of diabetes complications.Frequency, intensity, time and type of exercise completed.Long Term Response to Exercise:The effect of exercise on blood glucose levels, and therefore type two diabetes as a whole is considerable. Benefits include:The prevention of the disease in individuals currently undiagnosed.Improvement in the control of blood glucose levels.Improved insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced requirement for insulin based medication.Reduction in body fat resulting in increased insulin sensitivity.Reduced chance of developing cardiovascular disease, a common partner to diabetes.Stress reduction, therefore balancing hormone levels and contributing to healthy blood glucose levels.Condition Management:In addition to exercise, dietary management is often coupled with medication (insulin) to increase control over blood sugar levels.The treatment of any associated cardiovascular disease will also reduce complications associated with the condition.Hornsby, W.

Insurance Company Caps Insulin Copays at $25,"In case you missed the recent headlines: One of the largest insurance companies in the country has made a move to cap copays for insulin at $25 for a month's supply, attempting to broaden access to this life-sustaining medication that's become the poster child for outrageously high drug pricing in America.Share on PinterestAnnounced on April 2, the combined company of Cigna and Express Scripts -- which finalized a $67 billion merger at the end of 2018 -- plans to offer its members in participating plans a Patient Assurance Program that will cap out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, copays, co-insurance) for insulin at $25/month max. The new program will be finalized by year's end for Express Scripts members, and the start of 2020 for Cigna members.This comes at a time of increasing pressure over skyrocketing insulin prices in America, with multiple Congressional hearings underway -- including one today before the Senate Finance Committee with insurers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), and one tomorrow (4/10/19) involving the big three insulin makers being called to testify in front of a House panel. The current Insulin Pricing Crisis is a system-wide issue that has bubbled to the top of public consciousness, and is thankfully now being heatedly discussed at both the federal and state levels. While Cigna and Express Scripts' new $25 copay program is ""only a band-aid"" for certain people who have particular insurance plans that opt in, it is being called ""a step in the right direction"" by vocal advocates who recognize that it will help many people couldn't otherwise afford the insulin they need to survive.We reached out to Cigna/Express Scripts to answer the many questions that come to mind for PWDs (people with diabetes) like us: First off, how many PWDs actually stand to benefit from this?More than 700,000 people enrolled in commercially insured plans across Cigna and Express Scripts had filed a claim for insulin in 2018. So that is the potential population for this program, Cigna says. Many news stories report that the average Cigna/ES member is only paying $41 a month for insulin prior to this program, which is already fairly affordable...?The devil's in the details, of course. Cigna states that for the average Cigna/Express Scripts member, the price of a 30-day supply of insulin is only $41.50, while for those on High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) it's $81/month, and up to $100/month for those on HDHPs in which insulin is not on the preventative drug list where deductibles don't apply.Those amounts may not sound exorbitant, but what they don't take into account is that early in the year, prior to meeting an annual deductible or coinsurance requirement, many people are exposed to high costs and thus unaffordable insulin. So while a copay may hit just $41.50/month at some point late in the year, the truth is that for many months before that happens, the cost is hundreds of dollars higher. So yes, Cigna has some feel-good numbers to share, but they are a bit misleading and don't reflect reality.Cigna says this new Patient Assurance Program will amount to members' annual costs dropping from $1,000 to $250 -- which is meaningful however you slice it. Wait, members will only have to pay $25 -- and not meet their deductible first?Yes, that's correct. For those higher deductible plans, this moves insulin to a ""preventative drug"" category in which the deductible wouldn't apply. Instead, the low copay is available immediately. What insulins are being offered through this program?All three big insulin manufacturers -- Lilly, Novo and Sanofi -- are participating, according to Cigna/ES. We're told they plan to include both short-acting and basal insulins, but a full product list isn't yet available. We were immediately concerned about ""preferred brand"" status that could lead to another ""formulary war"" where drug makers jockey to get better access and lower copays ahead of their competitors, but Cigna insists the program will not have an impact on formulary status. How much insulin do members get for that $25 copay?The cost is $25 for a month's worth of each patient's individual prescription of insulin, whatever amount that may be and whether it's in vials or pen cartridges. Share on Pinterest But what if my Cigna insurance plan requires me to get 90 days of insulin rather than a single month's worth?You will still benefit, Cigna says. The copay for a 90-day supply, whether via mail delivery or retail, will be $75. When does this program begin and end?The powers-that-be tell us they expect it will launch for Express Scripts members before the end of this year, and for Cigna members beginning in 2020. This is not a pilot or trial program, and there's no end-date attached at this time. Why not just lower list prices for all insulins offered through Cigna?That's a separate issue, we're told (and given the convoluted nature of drug pricing including industry rebates and kickbacks, we're not surprised). So how is this being paid for?We wondered whether Cigna Corp. was absorbing the overhead costs. As it turns out, the participating drug makers (Lilly, Novo and Sanofi) are all providing an additional discount applied at the point of sale to push the copay down to $25. Sadly, this doesn't eliminate the issue of established rebates in broader insulin pricing, we're told. How do I know if my employer has signed up to participate in this?""We are not able to just automatically apply it to our clients,"" a Cigna spokeswoman said. ""They have to agree to participate because it's their benefit. We are going to encourage all clients to implement this as a program, and feel confident most will be eager to implement it."" There is no charge to participate, and Cigna assures us that ""most plans"" will not see any additional cost to get the co-payment down to $25 for the patient. Employers interested in participating can learn more about during open enrollment periods (annual insurance discussions when plan designs are evaluated), and are welcome to contact Cigna/ES to find out more. What about Medicare and Medicaid? And those without insurance, or who aren't covered by Cigna plans?To clarify: Sorry Folks, this will not apply to those on federal plans. It's a program specifically offered by Cigna and Express Scripts for their members. Will other insurance companies follow suit?We certainly hope so. When asked for a comment on that, a Cigna spokesperson provided this statement: ""Our job is to provide better care, more choice, and greater affordability. Our Patient Assurance Program offers all three. For customers and members who rely on insulin, Cigna and Express Scripts have found a way to deliver greater affordability and peace of mind to these patients, and we are confident that our new program will remove cost as a barrier for people in participating plans who need insulin. We're also glad the manufacturers are able to work with us to make it happen."" Why is this happening now?Good question. We wondered if it was a direct result of the new federal Health and Human Services (HHS) proposal to eliminate drug rebates... but Cigna says they have been working on this concept ""for a while"" and were finally able to make it materialize following the Cigna/ES merger finalization in December 2018. We still think it's pretty coincidental (and likely planned) that this move comes just as insurers and PBMs are being summoned before Congressional panels over drug and insulin pricing. Right. Isn't this just another PR move to take the heat off payors and other decision-makers on drug pricing?Some may roll their eyes, saying it's only a PR move -- but while there may be truth to that, it still helps.Just like the recently announced half-price Insulin Lispro from Eli Lilly, this is nowhere near a final solution to America's Insulin Pricing Crisis, of course. No one claims it is. But just like with that offer, if one more family can afford the insulin they desperately need, then it's a win for our Diabetes Community.The advocacy doesn't stop here, of course. We continue to cheer on the many insulin pricing advocacy initiatives and efforts to call manufacturers and PBM middle-men to task. Here's to slowly but surely moving the needle on insulin access (no pun intended).",https://t.co/1dqvvMlCmR,others
Human Insulin for Type 2 Diabetes,"Switching from expensive, newer-generation insulin analogs to older, lower-priced human insulin formulations may appeal to some patients with type 2 diabetes.But is it effective? Or safe?Two recent studies published in JAMA looked at human insulin and found essentially the same thing: overall, type 2 diabetes patients treated with human insulin formulations did not have worse outcomes than patients treated with new insulin analogs.""Our findings add to the growing body of literature suggesting that human insulin may be as safe and effective as newer, more expensive insulin analogs for many patients with type 2 diabetes,"" said Jing Luo, MD, MPH, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who led a cohort study of Medicare patients who switched from analogs to human insulin. ""These findings are especially meaningful for patients or payers who may be struggling with the increasing prices of insulin in the U.S.""Switching to Human InsulinIn a large retrospective cohort study of 14,635 Medicare beneficiaries, Luo and colleagues found a small initial increase in HbA1c when type 2 diabetes patients switched to human insulin and no difference in the rate of severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. But expenses fell considerably, and fewer patients reached the Medicare Part D coverage gap.The researchers evaluated differences in glycemic control and costs before, during, and after a 2015 intervention in which patients were encouraged to switch from analog to human insulin, either premixed human 70/30 or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. The start of the intervention was associated with a small (0.14%) but statistically significant increase in mean HbA1c levels (95% CI 0.05%-0.23%, P=0.003). Twelve months later, mean HbA1c levels stabilized and there were no significant changes among patients who made the switch (0.08%, 95% CI -0.01% to 0.17%).Moreover, total monthly insulin expenditures for these beneficiaries dropped by more than half, from approximately $3.4 million to $1.4 million. And the proportion of patients who reached the Medicare Part D coverage gap decreased from 20.6% to 11.1%.""Our findings suggest that a health plan intervention of switching older adults with type 2 diabetes from insulin analogs to human insulin formulations may be safe and clinically effective,"" Luo said. ""The mean HbA1c difference we found to be associated with the start of switch in the intervention -- a mean change +0.14% -- is likely not clinically significant.""But minor hypoglycemic episodes and nocturnal hypoglycemic events could not be measured in this study, Luo cautioned. And the intervention was conducted in an integrated health system that coordinated efforts between the health plan and clinicians to oversee insulin switching, which may have influenced results.Starting with Human InsulinIn an observational study of type 2 patients from 2006 to 2015, researchers found that people who started treatment with basal insulin analogs -- notably glargine (Lantus) or detemir (Levemir) -- did not have substantially better blood sugar control or lower hypoglycemia risk than patients who started with NPH insulin.""We compared the newer and older types of insulin in a large and diverse population of Kaiser Permanente type 2 diabetes patients who were newly prescribed insulin,"" said lead author Kasia Lipska, MD, MHS, of Yale School of Medicine, in a statement. ""The study was conducted under real-world conditions with uniquely detailed data about possible confounding factors and long-term outcomes.""""We found that for patients with type 2 diabetes in usual practice, the use of the more expensive insulin analogs did not appear to result in better safety -- at least as defined by hospital or emergency visits for hypoglycemia -- or better blood sugar control compared with NPH insulin,"" she noted. ""This suggests that many people with type 2 diabetes should consider starting with NPH insulin, instead of insulin analogs, especially if cost is an issue for them.""Counter to recent prescribing trends in the U.S., Kaiser Permanente of Northern California uses human insulin products preferentially. In this study comparing patients who initiated NPH insulin (n=23,561) with patients who initiated insulin analogs (n=1,928), Lipska and coauthors found that, over a mean follow-up of 1.7 years, hypoglycemia-related emergency department (ED) visits or hospital admissions were 8.8 events per 1,000 person-years in the NPH group and 11.9 events per 1,000 person-years in the analog group.Within 1 year of insulin initiation, HBA1c dropped from 9.4% to 7.9% in the NPH group and from 9.4% to 8.2% in the insulin analog group.But this analysis had limitations: it looked only at hypoglycemia that resulted in ED or hospital visits. Clinicians in the Kaiser Permanente system also had greater familiarity with NPH, which may have reduced the likelihood of hypoglycemia, noted Matthew Crowley, MD, MHS, and Matthew Maciejewski, PhD, both of the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center in North Carolina, in an accompanying editorial.In a recent report, the American Diabetes Association working group on insulin pricing suggested human insulin may be an appropriate alternative to more expensive analog insulins for some people with diabetes. ""What remains unknown is whether there is meaningful heterogeneity in how specific types of patients respond to basal insulin analogs and NPH insulin, and if such heterogeneity does exist, which factors moderate differences in patient responses,"" Crowley and Maciejewski pointed out.""For example, some patient subgroups may experience better clinical and economic outcomes with NPH insulin, some subgroups may have similar outcomes, and some subgroups may experience better clinical and economic outcomes with basal insulin analogs,"" they observed.""In this era of high costs of diabetes care, questions of value in insulin prescribing are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon,"" Crowley and Maciejewski added. ""Newer, even higher-priced basal insulin analogs are now being promoted despite their minor absolute benefits vs current widely used analog options, so questions about value will remain pressing into the foreseeable future.""Luo is a consultant to Alosa Health and Health Action International.Lipska reported no disclosures.Crowley and Maciejewski also reported no disclosures.",https://t.co/BBLAvdSUI7,others
What's behind skyrocketing insulin prices?,"Here's a sticking point for diabetics: the cost of insulin more than tripled — from $231 to $736 a year per patient — between 2002 and 2013, according to a new analysis.The increase reflected rising prices for a milliliter of insulin, which climbed 197 percent from $4.34 per to $12.92 during the same period. Meanwhile, the amount of money spent by each patient on other diabetes medications fell 16 percent, to $502 from $600, according to a research letter published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.""Insulin is a life-saving medication,"" said Dr. William Herman, a coauthor of the analysis and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. ""There are people with type 1 diabetes who will die without insulin. And while there have been incremental benefits in insulin products, prices have been rising. So there are people who can't afford them. It's a real problem.""The analysis also found that the cost of various widely used oral diabetes drugs either dropped in price or did not rise nearly as significantly as insulin. Metformin, for instance, which is available as a generic, fell to 31 cents in 2013 from $1.24 per tablet in 2002. And the newer class of diabetes drugs known as DPP-4 inhibitors rose 34 percent since becoming available in 2006.The researchers analyzed data from nearly 28,000 diabetes found in the Medical Expenditure Panel, a database on health care costs maintained by the US Department of Health and Human Services. About 1 in 4 people used insulin and two-thirds took a pill. Toward the end of the study period, a small percentage began taking new injectable medicines that are designed to complement pills.There have been previous efforts to track insulin prices in recent years, but the researchers explained this is the first attempt to examine national pricing data in this way for an extended period of time. And the findings are likely to further fuel the hot-button national debate over the rising cost of prescription medicines, which has also become a talking point in the presidential campaign.More than 29 million Americans, or 9.3 percent of the population, have some form of diabetes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Not surprisingly, there are numerous companies competing to grab a share of the market and newer forms of insulin have been introduced, notably, analog insulins that are man-made and differ slightly from human insulin.Payers report that unit costs are rising. One exception has been the widely used long-acting form of insulin called Lantus, which is marketed by Sanofi. The drug maker has been encountering pushback form insurers, and so the unit cost for the medicine fell nearly 14 percent last year, according to Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefits manager.More competition is expected for Lantus later this year when Eli Lilly is expected to launch a biosimilar version of the medication. But to what extent this drug will be affordable remains to be seen. Typically, when a generic version of a pill becomes available, the price drops 80 percent or more. But biosimilars are new to the United States and are forecast to cost about 20 percent to 30 percent less than a brand-name drug.Meanwhile, some doctors say diabetic patients, who are typically 60 years old or more, have difficulty paying for drugs, especially those who have trouble once they hit the donut hole in the Medicare Part D program and have to cover costs themselves. ""The cost of therapy is huge,"" said Dr. Jane Bridges, a diabetologist in Vincennes, Ind. ""I have patients who tell me that they have to stretch out the use of their medicines.""But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America argued that focusing on list prices ""misrepresents"" reality. The industry trade group maintained that wholesale prices generally do not correspond to net prices — what companies, unions, and government agencies pay — because drug makers offer rebates. The group cited an analysis by SSR Health that net prices declined last year.Spokespeople for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, two of the largest manufacturers of diabetes medicines, echoed that argument and both companies noted that patient-assistance programs are available. The Novo spokesman added that ""making comparisons between insulin and oral medications are not appropriate as each medication is designed to support a patient's specific glucose-control needs.""A Lilly spokeswoman maintained that the net price for its Humalog insulin rose an average of 1.6 percent annually from 2010 to 2015. However, she did not respond to questions about the rebates that were offered. Drug makers and pharmacy benefits managers are facing increasing criticism for their failure to disclose rebates and discounts.One analyst, meanwhile, contended that rising prices may not have any impact on patient outcomes.""I don't think you can draw a straight line from the rising cost of insulin to outcomes,"" said David Kliff, who publishes Diabetic Investor. ""Very few patients pay out of pocket for cost of insulin. So I don't think prices truly impact the patient pocket book. There's only a small percentage who don't have insurance or enough insurance.""But another author of the analysis disagreed.""High costs can lead to reduced compliance, but more importantly the cost-effectiveness of high cost therapies … should be assessed, so they produce a greater clinical benefit for the patient,"" Philip Clarke, a professor of health economics at the University of Melbourne in Australia. Other countries, he noted, routinely assess cost-effectiveness when setting prices for government-subsidized drugs.This article is reproduced with permission from STAT.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 13 (2016): n. pag. Print. @article{8540095, abstract = {Background: This study investigates prospective associations of anthropometrical and lifestyle indices with insulin resistance (IR) in European children from the IDEFICS cohort. Insulin resistance (IR) is a growing concern in childhood obesity and a central aspect of the metabolic syndrome (MS). It most likely represents the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Methods: This longitudinal study included 3348 preadolescent children aged 3 to 10.9 years from 8 European countries who were observed from 2007/2008 to 2009/2010. The main outcome measure in the present analysis is HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment as a common proxy indicator to quantify IR) at follow-up and in its longitudinal development. Anthropometrical measures and lifestyle indices, including objectively determined physical activity, were considered, among others factors, as determinants of IR. Prospective associations between IR at follow-up and anthropometrical and lifestyle indices were estimated by logistic regression models. Results: Country-specific prevalence rates of IR in the IDEFICS cohort of European children showed a positive trend with weight category. Prospective multivariate analyses showed the strongest positive associations of IR with BMI z-score (OR = 2.6 for unit change from the mean, 95 \% CI 2.1-3.1) and z-score of waist circumference (OR = 2.2 for unit change from the mean, 95 \% CI 1.9-2.6), which were analysed in separate models, but also for sex (OR = 2.2 for girls vs. boys, 95 \% CI 1.5-3.1 up to OR 2.5, 95 \% CI 1.8-3.6 depending on the model), audio-visual media time (OR = 1.2 for an additional hour per day, 95 \% CI 1.0-1.4 in both models) and an inverse association of objectively determined physical activity (OR = 0.5 for 3rd compared to 1st quartile, 95 \% CI 0.3-0.9 in both models). A longitudinal reduction of HOMA-IR was accompanied with a parallel decline in BMI. Conclusions: This study is, to our knowledge, the first prospective study on IR in a preadolescent children's population. It supports the common hypothesis that overweight and obesity are the main determinants of IR. Our data also indicate that physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle are likewise associated with the development of IR, independent of weight status.

"PNN for Apr. 30, 2019","&gt;&gt;&gt;Diabetes ReportSource: Early-online/May issue of Diabetes Care (2019; 42).Update to Standards of Medical Care: In an update to the ""living"" Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2019, the American Diabetes Association makes these medication-related changes:* Section 10 is updated based on the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) outcomes, which determined the addition of icosapent ethyl to statin therapy for patients with high triglyceride levels reduced cardiovascular events. The Standards of Care now include a recommendation that icosapent ethyl be considered for patients with diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiac risk factors on a statin with controlled LDL-C, but with elevated triglycerides (135–499) to reduce cardiovascular risk.* Sections 9, 10, and 11 are revised based on findings from The Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58) Trial, in which dapagliflozin treatment showed a reduction of hospitalization for heart failure and a reduction in progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).* Based on a revision to the prescribing information for dapagliflozin, for patients with diabetes and CKD, the approved use per estimated glomerular filtration rate is revised from ≥60 mL/min/1.73 sq m to ≥45 mL/min/1.73 sq m in Section 11 of the Standards of Care.Dapagliflozin, Liver Fat &amp; Tissue Insulin Sensitivity: In patients with obesity and liver fat, 8 weeks of dapagliflozin therapy reduced both the volumes of visceral adipose tissue and liver proton density fat fraction (PDFF), researchers report (pp. 931–7; P. Nuutila, pirjo.nuutila@utu.fi).PICO: Randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study of 32 patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c 6.5–10.5% (48–91 mmol/mol) and 3 months or more of stable treatment with metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, or both; randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo daily for 8 weeks; measures included tissue insulin sensitivity, positron emission tomography during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp; PDFF and adipose tissue volumes.Results: ""After 8 weeks, glycemic control was improved by dapagliflozin (placebo-corrected change in HbA1c −0.39%, P &lt; 0.01), but whole-body glucose uptake was not increased (P = 0.90). Tissue-specific insulin-stimulated glucose uptake did not change in skeletal muscle, liver, myocardium, or white and brown adipose tissue, and endogenous glucose production remained unaffected. However, there were significant placebo-corrected decreases in liver PDFF (−3.74%, P &lt; 0.01), liver volume (−0.10 L, P &lt; 0.05), visceral adipose tissue volume (−0.35 L, P &lt; 0.01), interleukin-6 (−1.87 pg/mL, P &lt; 0.05), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (−96 ng/L, P = 0.03).""SMBG in Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes: In the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study, adherence with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was poor and declined over time, and low adherence was associated with higher glycated hemoglobin levels (pp. 903–9; B. H. Braffett, braffett@bsc.gwu.edu).PICO: 699 participants taking oral medications were asked to perform SMBG twice daily; after reaching the primary outcome (PO) HbA1c ≥8% (64 mmol/mol) over 6 months or an inability to wean from temporary insulin because of metabolic decompensation, insulin glargine was started.Results: ""SMBG declined over time and was inversely related to HbA1c (P &lt; 0.0001).

"The effect of a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet versus a low-glycemic index diet on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus","In this study, both a low-glycemic index, reduced-calorie diet and a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet led to improvement in glycemic control, diabetic medication elimination/reduction, and weight loss in adherent overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes over a 24-week period. The diet containing fewer carbohydrates, the LCKD, was most effective for improving glycemic control. In patients taking insulin, the effects were often quite powerful. For example, participants taking from 40 to 90 units of insulin before the study were able to eliminate their insulin use, while also improving glycemic control. Because this effect occurs immediately upon implementing the dietary changes, individuals with type 2 diabetes who are unable to adjust their own medication or self-monitor their blood glucose should not make these dietary changes unless under close medical supervision.A low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet combines two approaches that, on their own, improve blood glucose control: weight loss and a reduced-glycemic index diet. Weight loss via dietary modification has a beneficial effect on diabetes [27, 28]. A reduced-glycemic index diet without weight loss can also lead to improvement in diabetic control, with the magnitude of effect of a 0.43% reduction in hemoglobin A1c, when compared with higher-glycemic diets of similar carbohydrate content [4]. The greater effect of the low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet in this study appeared to be due to the lower carbohydrate intake, because statistical significance remained after adjustment for weight loss. Because ""low-glycemic"" diets in previous studies typically contain from 40–60% of calories from carbohydrate, it is possible that the beneficial effect of ""low-glycemic"" diets could be augmented by further reduction of the absolute amount of carbohydrate, or by a reduction in caloric content.While this study was a treatment trial of individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle modification has been shown to prevent type 2 diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The intensive lifestyle modification arm of the DPP included a calorie- and fat-restricted diet with an energy intake of 1380 kcal/day for women and 1583 kcal/day for men, and a percentage of energy from carbohydrate of 54% [29]. While the effect was stronger than medication, the intensive lifestyle group developed diabetes at a rate of 20% after 4 years. Future research should include the use of lower-carbohydrate diets for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes.Like previous studies, we found that the LCKD led to weight reduction, improvement in glycemic control, and elevation in HDL-cholesterol, but no deterioration in fasting lipid parameters. Extending these findings, we observed that all metabolic syndrome components were improved by the LCKD [30]. It is interesting to note that the LGID group reported consuming fewer calories than the LCKD group, yet had less weight loss. This may reflect problems with the diet data as collected, issues with differential physical activity, or metabolic inefficiency (leading to increased energy expenditure) which may occur during the consumption of a carbohydrate-restricted diet.Limitations of this study include the lack of blinding of physicians and outcome assessors to treatment group, and the use of food records. The study participants were community volunteers, and predominantly women, which may limit generalization of these findings to clinical populations and men. The analysis and presentation of only detailed food records may bias the estimate of food intake. We chose the ""completer analysis"" as the primary outcome because we were interested in answering the question of what might be expected from patients who can adhere to the intervention. The LOCF analysis might generalize better to a population of patients who have different food preferences from their assigned diet, who lose/lack motivation, or who experience other barriers to dietary change. Another possible limitation is the baseline imbalance in the primary outcome, HgA1c, which occurred despite random allocation. The equation used to calculate energy requirements for the LGID participants may underestimate requirements, particularly in obese people. This would result in more severe energy restriction than the 500 kcal deficit as stated, which might bias the weight loss effects in favor of the LGID.It is often presumed that obesity is the cause of type 2 diabetes, but there are clearly instances where obesity occurs without type 2 diabetes, and instances where type 2 diabetes occurs without obesity. In this study, the change in hemoglobin A1c was independent of the change in weight (Figure 2). This supports the concept that weight change and glycemic control are not serially linked but rather may be the result of the same pathophysiologic process, such as abnormal insulin metabolism.The underlying principle of carbohydrate-restriction and the historic precedents of using the low-carbohydrate diet for type 2 diabetes suggest that the low-carbohydrate approach may be one of the most effective dietary treatments for diabetes. Our findings support this position, and it suggests that the burden of proof be placed upon alternative points of view. The dearth of randomized, controlled trials using the low-carbohydrate approach for type 2 diabetes, despite the historical and current clinical use of these approaches, challenges the idea that the randomized controlled trial should be the only guide of scientific inquiry and clinical practice.",https://t.co/RzTfDScqHw,others
Endothelial Adora2a activation promotes blood-brain barrier breakdown and cognitive impairment in mice with diet-induced insulin resistance,"AbstractObesity and insulin resistance elicit blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in humans and animal models, but the relative contributions of the two pathologies remain poorly understood. These studies initially addressed the temporal progression of cerebrovascular dysfunction relative to dietary obesity or diet-induced insulin resistance in male mice. Obesity increased BBB permeability to the low molecular weight fluorophore sodium fluorescein (NaFl), while diet-induced insulin resistance increased permeability to both NaFl and Evans Blue, which forms a high molecular weight complex with serum albumin. Serial section transmission electron microscopy analysis of hippocampal capillaries revealed that diabetes promotes involution of tight junctions, fenestration of endothelial cells, and pericyte regression. Chronic activation of adenosine receptor 2a (Adora2a) erodes tight junctions between endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature in other models of chronic neuropathology, and we observed that acute Adora2a antagonism normalized BBB permeability in wildtype (Wt) mice with diet-induced insulin resistance. Experiments in mice with inducible deletion of Adora2a in endothelial cells revealed protection against BBB breakdown with diet-induced insulin resistance, despite comparable metabolic dysfunction relative to nontransgenic littermates. Protection against BBB breakdown was associated with decreased vascular inflammation, recovery of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and restoration of hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in vascular endothelial cells disrupts the BBB in dietary obesity, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the underlying mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and insulin resistance.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of circulating factors into the brain, but obesity promotes BBB breakdown in humans and animal models. We used transgenic mice with resistance to BBB breakdown to investigate the role of neurovascular dysfunction in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive impairment. Transgenic mice with inducible ablation of Adora2a in endothelial cells were protected against BBB breakdown on HFD, despite comparable metabolic impairments relative to normal mice. Transgenic mice were also resistant to HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction and were protected against deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in endothelial cells mediates obesity-induced BBB breakdown, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and diabetes.FootnotesThe authors declare no competing financial interests.This work was supported by grants R01DK110586 and K01DK100616 from the NIH to A.M.S.

L-PGDS-produced PGD,"Expression profile of the L-PGDS geneFor the various tissues of LFD- and HFD-fed mice, the expression of the L-PGDS gene was the highest in the brain, followed by the heart in both LFD- and HFD-fed mice and in white adipose tissue (WAT) in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 1a). The mRNA level of the L-PGDS gene in WAT of HFD-fed mice was selectively enhanced approximately 2.3-fold as compared with LFD and was almost unchanged in other tissues (Fig. 1a).Figure 1Expression profiles of L-PGDS gene in mice and adipocytes. (a) Tissue distribution of L-PGDS gene expression in mice. Mice (C57BL/6N, 5-week-old; n = 3) were fed LFD (gray columns) or HFD (black columns) for 8 weeks. RNA was prepared from various tissues, and the mRNA levels of the L-PGDS gene were measured by qPCR. Data are shown as means ± S.D. *p &lt; 0.01, as indicated by the brackets. (b) Comparison of expression profiles of L-PGDS (blue columns), aP2 (red circles), and AdipoQ (black circles) genes during adipogenesis of mouse 3T3-L1 cells. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes for 6 days. RNA was prepared and qPCR analysis was performed to measure the transcription levels of the L-PGDS, aP2, and AdipoQ genes. Data are represented as means ± S.D.We then examined the expression of the L-PGDS gene and two adipogenic marker genes, aP2 (Fabp4) and adiponectin (AdipoQ) during adipogenesis of mouse adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1b). The transcription of the aP2 gene was induced in premature adipocytes even at 2 days after the initiation of adipogenesis and was gradually enhanced during adipogenesis, whose profile closely resembled that of the L-PGDS gene. On the other hand, the expression of the AdipoQ gene was very low at 2 days in premature adipocytes and was induced at 4 days in the mature stage of adipogenesis, indicating that the AdipoQ gene was selectively expressed in mature adipocytes and that its expression came later than those of the L-PGDS and aP2 genes.Generation and molecular characterization of adipose-specific L-PGDS KO miceTo study the roles of L-PGDS and PGD2 in obesity, we generated the experimental mice by breeding the L-PGDS flox/flox mice with either of two distinct types of adipose-specific L-PGDS gene knockout (KO) mice: aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 2a).Figure 2Adipose-specific L-PGDS KO mice. (a) Strategy to generate the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice. Wild-type, targeted, floxed, and null L-PGDS gene loci were shown. Primers used for genotyping by PCR were indicated as arrows. Exons were shown as boxes, and the number of exons were shown above boxes. Neo means the gene for neomycin phosphotransferase. FRT means the flippase recognition target. (b) Expression of the Cre and L-PGDS genes in the HFD-fed wild-type (W; white columns), L-PGDS flox/flox (C; gray columns), aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox (LKO; black columns) mice. Mice (7-week-old; n = 5) were fed an HFD for 11 weeks and the mRNA levels of both genes in the brain, liver, and vWAT was measured by qPCR. n.d. means not detected. Data are shown as means ± S.D. #p &lt; 0.01, as indicated by the bracket. (c) Western blot analysis of L-PGDS expression in the brain, liver, and vWAT of the HFD-fed L-PGDS flox/flox (C), aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, and AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox (LKO). Protein (20 μg) was applied in each lane. Data are the representative of each of the three mice.The null L-PGDS allele was detected in visceral WAT (vWAT) of the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, but not in the AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (513-bp), although the floxed L-PGDS was detected in all tissues of both L-PGDS flox/flox and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (2513-bp; Supplemental Fig. S1). The body weight gains of wild-type and L-PGDS flox/flox mice were almost the same under LFD or HFD conditions (Supplemental Fig. S2a). Moreover, the expression levels of the L-PGDS mRNA in the brain, liver, and vWAT of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice were almost the same as those of wild-type mice under LFD or HFD conditions (Supplemental Fig. S2b).The Cre transgene was abundantly expressed in vWAT under the control of the aP2 promoter/enhancer or AdipoQ promoter, but not in the brain and liver (Fig. 2b). In addition, the mRNA for the Cre transgene was not detected in wild-type mice (Fig. 2b). The mRNA level of the L-PGDS gene was significantly reduced in vWAT of the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, but unchanged in their brains and livers, as compared with that of the control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the adipose-specific decrease in the L-PGDS mRNA level was not detected in vWAT of the AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, although the Cre transgene was expressed in WAT in these mice under the control of the AdipoQ promoter (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, to confirm a decrease in L-PGDS protein, we carried out Western blot analysis. The expression of L-PGDS protein in the brain and liver of the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox or AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice was almost the same as those in the L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 2c). In contrast, L-PGDS expression was clearly lowered in vWAT of HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, but not in vWAT of the HFD-fed AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 2c).These results reveal that the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice exhibited the adipose-specific decrease in L-PGDS gene expression.Decrease of body weight gain in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox miceWe then measured body weight gains in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, and control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (7-week-old; n = 5) following 11 weeks of either LFD or HFD. At the start of the experiment, average body weight was not significantly different among the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, and control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 3a). Under LFD conditions for 11 weeks, no significant changes in body weight gain were found among the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, or control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 3a,b). In contrast, the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice fed an HFD gained significantly less body weight, as compared with those in the control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 3a,b). On the other hand, body weight gain was not altered in the AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice even under HFD conditions, as compared with those of the control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 3a,b). Food intake rates were similar between L-PGDS flox/flox (control) and either aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox or AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under both LFD and HFD conditions (Fig. 3c).Figure 3Change of body weight gain in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice. (a) Body weight change in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox, and control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (7-week-old; n = 5–6) under LFD or HFD conditions for 11 weeks. Body weight was measured every week. Data are representative of 4 independent experiments (n = 4–6) and shown as means ± S.D. #p &lt; 0.01, as compared with the HFD-fed L-PGDS flox/flox mice. (b) Photographs of the representative 18-week-old control L-PGDS flox/flox (C), aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox (LKO) mice under LFD or HFD conditions. (c) Daily food intake per gram body weight. Data are shown as means ± S.D. (n = 4–6).We further characterized the phenotype of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under HFD conditions. PGD2 level was lowered in vWAT of the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice to be about 53% of that of the control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 4a). Computed tomography (CT) analysis (Fig. 4b) revealed that the weights of vWAT and subcutaneous WAT (sWAT) were decreased in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice to be about 64% and 73%, respectively, of those of the control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the ratio of fat in body mass {Fat (%)} was reduced in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under HFD conditions to be approximately 73% of those of the control L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 4c). While, the body fat mass (vWAT and sWAT) and the ratio of fat in body mass {Fat (%)} were similar between L-PGDS flox/flox and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under LFD conditions (Fig. 4c).Figure 4Decrease of body fat in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice.

Significant difference between aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox (LKO) mice and control L-PGDS flox/flox (C) under HFD conditions was shown as #p &lt; 0.01 with the brackets.Histological analysis showed that HFD increased adipocyte size approximately 3.9-fold in the L-PGDS flox/flox mice, but only about 1.8-fold in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 4d,e). These results indicate that body weight gain and fat mass increases by HFD were reduced in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice.Change in the expression level of the genes involved in the PG synthetic pathway and PG receptors in vWAT and sWAT of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox miceIn the L-PGDS flox/flox (control) mice, HFD increased the transcription levels of the L-PGDS gene about 3.5- and 1.8-fold in vWAT (Fig. 5a) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3a), respectively, as compared with those in LFD-fed condition. In contrast, in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, HFD decreased the L-PGDS mRNA levels to approximately 13% and 34% in vWAT (Fig. 5a) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3a), respectively, of those of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice.Figure 5Changes of gene expression levels in vWAT of the LFD- or HFD-fed mice. (a) Expression of the PG synthetic genes in vWAT of the LFD- or HFD-fed control L-PGDS flox/flox (C: gray columns) and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (L: black columns; 18-week-old; n = 5–6) under LFD or HFD. The expression levels of the indicated genes were measured by qPCR. Data are present as means ± S.D. *p &lt; 0.01, as indicated by the brackets. Significant difference between aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox (LKO) mice and control L-PGDS flox/flox (C) under HFD conditions was shown as #p &lt; 0.01 with the brackets. (b) Expression of the adipogenic, lipogenic, and lipolytic genes in vWAT of LFD- or HFD-fed control L-PGDS flox/flox (C: gray columns) and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (L: black columns; 18-week-old; n = 5–6) under LFD or HFD conditions. The expression levels of the indicated genes were measured by qPCR. Data are present as means ± S.D. *p &lt; 0.01, as indicated by the brackets. Significant difference between aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox (LKO) mice and control L-PGDS flox/flox (C) under HFD conditions was shown as #p &lt; 0.01 with the brackets.In addition, HFD also elevated gene expression of H-PGDS, another PGDS; cPLA2, and COX-2, both are upstream enzymes in PGD2 biosynthesis; and DP2 (CRTH2) receptors; one of PGD2 receptors, about 2.3- and 1.8-, 2.3- and 1.4-, 2.1- and 2.0-, and 1.5-fold, respectively, but unchanged the expression level of the COX-1 gene in vWAT (Fig. 5a) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3a), as compared with those of the control L-PGDS flox/flox mice under LFD conditions. However, in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, the mRNA levels of those genes were not changed in vWAT (Fig. 5a) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3a). These results indicate that the mRNA levels of the PGD2 synthetic genes, except for the L-PGDS gene were not changed in WAT of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under HFD conditions.Decreased expression of the adipogenic and lipogenic genes in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox miceNext, we investigated the expression levels of the adipogenic genes in vWAT and sWAT of the LFD- or HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and control L-PGDS flox/flox mice using qPCR. Under LFD conditions, the transcription levels of the adipogenic genes such as PPARγ, C/EBPα, aP2, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were similar between L-PGDS flox/flox and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 5b and Supplemental Fig. S3a). HFD increased the mRNA levels of the PPARγ, C/EBPα, aP2, and LPL genes, approximately 6.2- and 5.2-, 5.6- and 4.6-, 4.3- and 2.0-, and 4.2- and 1.6-fold, respectively in vWAT (Fig. 5b) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3a) of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice, and about 2.6- and 3.0-, 2.4- and 3.3-, 1.8- and 2.1-, and 3.7- and 1.2-fold, respectively in vWAT (Fig. 5b) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3a) of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice. The HFD-induced increases in the mRNA levels of these adipogenic genes were clearly lower in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice than the control L-PGDS flox/flox mice. The transcription levels of these genes in HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice were decreased about 51% and 37%, 56% and 50%, 53% and 28%, and 18% and 42%, respectively, in vWAT (Fig. 5b) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3b), as compared with each of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice.The mRNA levels of the lipogenic genes: e.g., fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and SREBP-1c were mostly unchanged in both vWAT and sWAT between L-PGDS flox/flox and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under LFD conditions (Fig. 5b and Supplemental Fig. S3b). In contrast, HFD enhanced the mRNA levels in vWAT and sWAT of the FAS, SCD, and SREBP-1c genes approximately 4.3- and 3.4-, 7.3- and 6.0-, and 8.1- and 5.2-fold, respectively, of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice, and about 1.8- and 2.3-, 3.7- and 2.6-, and 3.1- and 4.3-fold, respectively, in vWAT and sWAT of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 5b, Supplemental Fig. S3b). The transcription levels of these genes under HFD in vWAT (Fig. 5b) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3b) of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice were reduced approximately 51% and 37%, 37% and 57%, 50% and 36%, respectively, of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice. HFD also increased the expression levels of the ACC gene in vWAT and sWAT (Fig. 5b and Supplemental Fig. S3b), but its gene expression was not altered between aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice and L-PGDS flox/flox mice. These results suggest that the expression levels of the adipogenic and lipogenic genes were lowered in WAT of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under HFD conditions.Effect to lipolysis in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox miceWe investigated the effects of L-PGDS and PGD2 in the lipolysis in WAT of the LFD- or HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and control L-PGDS flox/flox mice. The expression levels of the adipose triacylglyceride (TG) lipase (ATGL), HSL, and monoacylglyceride lipase (MGL) genes involved in TG metabolism (lipolysis) were similar in vWAT and sWAT of the L-PGDS flox/flox and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under LFD conditions (Fig. 5b and Supplemental Fig. S3b). In contrast, the mRNA levels of the ATGL and MGL genes were elevated in HFD-fed mice by approximately 3.2- and 9.4-, and 4.3- and 7.6-fold, respectively, in vWAT (Fig. 5b) and sWAT (Supplemental Fig. S3b) in the L-PGDS flox/flox mice. Moreover, the transcription levels of the ATGL and MGL genes in vWAT and sWAT were approximately 2.5- and 1.4-, and 4.8- and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice than those in the L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 5b and Supplemental Fig. S3b). Whereas, the mRNA levels of the HSL gene in vWAT and sWAT were unchanged in both groups of mice, although HFD induced the transcription levels of this gene when compared with those of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 5b and Supplemental Fig. S3b). These results reveal that lipolysis may be enhanced in WAT of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice under HFD conditions.Serum metabolic markers in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox miceAfter LFD- or HFD-feeding for 11 weeks, serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels were not significantly altered in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and L-PGDS flox/flox mice either by LFD or HFD, although the level was slightly higher in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice than the HFD-fed L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Table 1). Under LFD conditions, serum levels of total cholesterol and total lipid were significantly decreased in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Table 1). Further investigation is needed to understand the reason why these levels were decreased in the LFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice. Moreover, the levels of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, glucose, and TG were significantly lower in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice than in the L-PGDS flox/flox mice under HFD conditions (Table 1). These results indicate that serum levels of cholesterols, glucose, and TG were lowered in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDSflox/flox mice.Table 1 Serum biochemical parameters in L-PGDS flox/flox and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice.Improvement of inflammation in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox miceWhen the expression levels of the macrophage marker genes were measured in vWAT and sWAT of the LFD- and HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and control L-PGDS flox/flox mice, the transcription levels of the M1 macrophage marker genes such as F4/80 and CD11c, were similar in both aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and L-PGDS flox/flox mice under LFD conditions (Fig. 6 and Supplemental Fig. S4). In contrast, HFD elevated the mRNA levels of the F4/80 and CD11c genes in vWAT and sWAT, about 6.3- and 5.0-, and 5.6- and 4.7-fold, respectively, in the L-PGDSflox/flox mice. However, the mRNA levels of the F4/80 and CD11c genes were not significantly increased in vWAT and sWAT of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice by HFD feeding (Fig. 6 and Supplemental Fig. S4). The mRNA levels of the F4/80 and CD11c genes were decreased to about 44% and 62%, and 56% and 46%, respectively, in vWAT and sWAT of the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, as compared with the L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 6 and Supplemental Fig. S4). In contrast, the mRNA levels of the M2 macrophage marker genes; e.g., CD163, CD204, and CD206 were not significantly altered or rather increased in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice as compared with the L-PGDS flox/flox mice in the HFD-fed condition (Fig. 6 and Supplemental Fig. S4). These results suggest that adipose-specific L-PGDS is associated with the elevation of inflammation in WAT.Figure 6Expression of inflammatory genes in vWAT of LFD- or HFD-fed mice. Expression of the macrophage (M1 and M2) marker genes in vWAT of the LFD- or HFD-fed control L-PGDS flox/flox (C: gray columns) and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice (L: black columns; 18-week-old; n = 5–6) under LFD or HFD conditions. The expression levels of the indicated genes were measured by qPCR. Data are present as means ± S.D. *p &lt; 0.01, as indicated by the brackets.Improvement of insulin sensitivity in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox miceNext, we investigated insulin sensitivity in the LFD- and HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and control L-PGDS flox/flox mice. Serum insulin levels were not significantly different between aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and control L-PGDS flox/flox mice under both LFD and HFD conditions (Fig. 7a). However, serum insulin levels in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice were slightly higher than those of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 7a).Figure 7HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice exhibited increased insulin sensitivity. (a) Measurement of serum insulin level. Control L-PGDS flox/flox (C: gray columns) and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox (LKO: black columns) mice (7-week-old; n = 5) were fed LFD or HFD for 11 weeks. Data are shown as means ± S.D. (b) Insulin tolerance test. Control L-PGDS flox/flox (gray circles; n = 5) and aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox (black circles; n = 5) mice (7-week-old) were fed LFD or HFD for 11 weeks, and fasted for 16 h before receiving an i.p. injection of 0.75 U/kg insulin. Serum glucose concentrations were measured at indicated time points. Data are shown as means ± S.D. The area under the curve (AUC) was compared by student's t-test. #p &lt; 0.01, as compared with the HFD-fed L-PGDS flox/flox mice.An intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test was carried out to elucidate insulin sensitivity of the LFD- and HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and L-PGDS flox/flox mice. After injection of insulin, glucose levels in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and L-PGDS flox/flox mice were similar under LFD conditions (Fig. 7b). In contrast, when fed an HFD, serum glucose levels in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice were lower than those of the L-PGDS flox/flox mice (Fig. 7b). These results reveal that adipose L-PGDS is associated with the impairment of insulin sensitivity in mice.",https://t.co/mNwXpliKL4,others
Emergency Help Needed,"Emergency Help Needed $495 of $3,500 goal Raised by 7 people in 1 month This is a very shameful thing right now, but we need serious help with our bills.The funds to help us pay off and catch up all the bills have been taken from us.Our gas is: $391.57Our electricity is: $1310.13Our rent is: $645.40Our trash is: $150.00New water heater is: $700.00 (est.)Total $3179.10We had the ability to get everything caught up, we filed taxes and we're about to get just over $12,000 back. Then the state of Minnesota decided to decline my step daughter's health insurance, and backdated going all the way back to August 2018 which left us on the hook for well over the $12,000, of which they already took from us.Because the insurance was rejected, the state of Minnesota paid some of the bills that were owed and we have to pay the state back. That's how they Justified having the ability to take all our refund back and we cannot file an appeal to get that money.We still do not have hot water, so we can't even bathe!The only reasons we have gotten as far behind as we had has been because we never got fully caught up on our bills. And the money we did have had been spent on food and clothes for the kids. Scott County has treated us extremely unfairly. Now, We finally had the opportunity to get ahead and it was robbed from us.This is why serious help is needed. I have another GoFundMe account, but that is for my medical expenses, and all that money goes directly into an HSA (Health Savings Account) that I cannot touch until it is being used to pay for my medical expenses.I will post copies of the bills as I'm able to download them all. + Read More",https://t.co/hDAoTxegO4,others

"Introduction anti-depressants SSRI's, SNRI,s, SSNRI's side-effects","The Neurotransmitter ""Serotonin"" &amp; Serotonin Acting Anti-depressantsSince 1988 the pharmaceutical companies (starting with Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of ""Prozac"") have advertised to the people (direct to consumer) as well as to their family doctors,that if you suffer from depressive feelings, you must have a ""biochemical imbalance"" in your brain. The advertising finger was pointed at the neurotransmitter ""serotonin"", and it is used to explain nearly any emotional problem a person might have nowadays. Many other pharmaceutical companies came out with so many variants on the SSRI-antidepressant to try and capitalize on its popularity, by spreading this theory even further amongst the people. Theory? Yes, only a theory! The Truth is that nobody in the medical field really knows if a""biochemicalimbalance""is the cause of any mental disorder, and they do not know how even the hypothesized ""biochemical imbalances"" could produce the emotional, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms that characterize any mental disorder. Clever marketing tactics exercised on us by the pharmaceutical industry, prevailed above scientifical evidence and research. Greed, dis-respect and contempt of the population, prevailed above altruism, medical care and responsibility.It's the greatest shame of of this era. More information:Primary care doctors prescribe SSRI-antidepressants to millions of adults, adolescents and children, certainly not only for treatment of depression anymore. SSRI's are prescribed for school phobias, bed wetting, eating disorders, sleep disturbances (insomnia), nail biting, hair pulling, headache, gambling addiction, alcohol addiction, back pain, stomach upset, premenstrual syndrome, etc., and even to ""feel better then well"". SSRI's have become all purpose ""feel good pills"", nowadays, in the year 2000. Unfortunately many doctors are unaware of the major consequences and some of them don't even seem tocare. They argue that the positive effects of SSRI's far outweigh their negative effects. Nothing could be further from the truth. SSRI's may not be compared with regular medications, like insulin to treat diabetics. SSRI's are psychoactive, blood-brain barrier passing drugs and interact with the serotonergic system in the brain. Another example of drugs interacting with the serotonergic system are LSD and Ecstasy (MDMA). The serotonergic system is responsible for ""how we perceive, experience and feel the inside and outside world"". YOU and only YOU created the neuropaths of this serotonergic system through the years by learning new things over and over again. And so it represents YOUR serotonergic system with it's own unique structure, playing a big role in the composition of YOUR mind, YOUR consciousness, YOUR emotions, YOUR thoughts. When these serotonergic brain cells are artificially pushed (by SSRI's) to act beyond their capacity or boundaries, this can result in the most disastrous serious adverse reactions. People need to be informed about the risks especially when children are involved. Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitor = Impairing Body Serotonin MetabolismSSRI's are ""Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors."" Neuronal re-uptake of neurotransmitters is metabolism. What serotonin re-uptake inhibitor actually means is that the SSRI-antidepressant interferes with ones ability to metabolise serotonin, so that will build up. In other words, an SSRI-antidepressant impairs the ability of cells to metabolise serotonin, not only in the brain, but -since serotonin is widely distributed throughout the body- in the body as well! The greatest concentration of serotonin, around 90%, is not found in the brain, but is found in the gastrointestinal or digestive tract (human gut, intestines, bowels).Originally, the neurotransmitter serotonin -thought to be secreted by the Pineal Gland- is called a neurohormone, because of it's specific regulatory effect on the activity of the Endocrine Glands in the human body. (1),(2) Affecting serotonin means affecting the Glandular Endocrine System. Next to it, serotonin affects the Cardiovascular System and the Respiratory System, under which, the lungs.Serotonin is also found in blood platelets and stimulates platelet aggregation (blood clotting). Furthermore, serotonin is known to affect contraction of smooth muscles (such as those of the gut) and blood vessel elasticity (vasoconstriction and expansion).More information:Fraudulent Clinical Trials and the FDAMany primary care doctors and most people believe, that SSRI's have undergone independent tests controlled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to insure safety. In fact the FDA does not ""test"" proposed new drugs. It relies almost exclusively on safety and efficacy data provided by the drug's sponsor. SSRI studies are constructed, financed, and supervised entirely by pharmaceutical companies themselves. The testing process is deeply flawed. The clinical tests of antidepressants (SSRI's) are remarkably short. Although the FDA's guidelines for large-scale clinical tests recommend they last at least 6 weeks, in some instances studies as short as 4 weeks are accepted. Typically, the studies last 6 to 8 weeks!And how about the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)? Already in 1993, 28,623 reports of adverse reactions to ""Prozac"" -the Eli Lilly SSRI, approved for the market since 1988- had been received by the FDA. These included effects such as delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, violent hostility, aggression, psychosis, 1,885 suicide attempts and 1,734 deaths - 1,089 by suicide. However, this didn't seem to be enough to provoke the FDA to act against the SSRI manufacturer. As a major consequence from this lack of action, other pharmaceutical companies were permitted to follow Eli Lilly's example, resulting in more Prozac copy-cat SSRI's like Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, etc., nowadays, and probably more to come in the near future. How many reports of adverse reactions to these SSRI's must the FDA receive to pull them from the market? Or has this already gone too far? Personality Structure and Out of Character BehaviourWe now have legal psychoactive, blood-brain barrier passing drugs, acting on the serotonergic system (SSRI's), the dopaminergic system (SDRI's) and the nor-adrenergic system (SNRI's) in the brain. The neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine (adrenalin) and nor-epinephrine (nor-adrenalin) are called ""catecholamines"" and control the adrenergic systems in the central nervous system (CNS). They account for staying awake, mood, fight or flight response, etc.. Serotonin is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter modulating the excitatory catecholamine systems in the CNS. Serotonin neurons control memory, mood, sex drive, etc.. Serotonin, dopamine and nor-epinephrine (nor-adrenalin) are the key-neurotransmitters involved with the construction of YOUR personality structure, as stated by doctor C. Robert Cloninger. Every drug that acts on the serotonergic system will affect (indirectly) the other neurotransmitter systems (dopaminergic, nor-adrenergic) in the brain (and visa-versa), thereby affecting YOUR personality structure, YOUR temperament, YOUR character. This must be exactly what happened to the antidepressant influenced home, school- and workplace shooters/killers who have reached the attention of the media since 1988. It's striking how every time, when involvement of an SSRI comes to public attention, pharmaceutical companies defend their serotonergic drugs by telling us over and over again that the fact that a shooter was taking an SSRI, was purely a coincidence, that the shooter was treated with an SSRI for ""mental illness"" and that the SSRI had nothing to do with his/her violent behaviour, (remember that SSRI's are prescribed for almost anything, not only for ""mental illness""). The pharmaceutical companies argue that there is no evidence that SSRI's cause suicide or violence. They refer to the ""scientific rigorous battery of independent clinical trials"" that the SSRI's have undergone under the auspices of the American FDA to insure their efficacy and safety. A recent study tells us a different story!However, who needs ""clinical trials"" when there is so much and hard evidence of violence related to SSRI's in the media... Isn't it striking how many home, school- and workplace shooters have reached the attention of the media since 1988? The first SSRI-antidepressant named ""Luvox"" was approved for the market on 25 march 1987 and the SSRI ""Prozac"" on 29 December 1987! Do you see the connection already? We now have several SSRI's all acting on the same serotonergic system in the brain. Did these SSRI's help the shooters to become more happy? Oh yes, so happy that the natural boundaries of their personality structure were far exceeded! They lost their emotional connection with their conscience, they became disconnected, they were pushed over the edge, THEIR edge!! Serious Adverse ReactionsAfter growing reports concerning withdrawal symptoms to SSRI-antidepressants, pharmaceutical companies renamed these phenomena ""antidepressant discontinuation syndrome"", avoiding the negative connotations of the word ""withdrawal"". This creates the illusion that one is familiar with the side-effects from SSRI's, that they are rarely reported and that their products are safe. Ofcourse they want the people and doctors to keep on believing that withdrawal only happens to a minority of people and that the symptoms are mild and short-lived.In fact the side effects from SSRI-antidepressants are far more serious than just the addiction to it and withdrawal symptoms. Many individuals who took an SSRI-antidepressant or tried to get off an SSRI-antidepressant experienced the most horrible adverse reactions.Many individuals have suffered for years or are still suffering because they experienced an extremely negative reaction to one of these drugs! What happened in the brains of these individuals? Scientists have recently discoveredthat Prozac induces muscle contractions in the worm suggesting that Prozac has other molecular targets in the brain. Researchers from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia have found changes in brain cellsin rats treated with SSRI's. The brain cells shrivelled or took on abnormal corkscrew shapes. What happens to the serotonergic system in the brain? The same system that's stimulated by administration of LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide), the system that's involved with our perception. Doctors reported LSD flashbacks in adolescents -with a history of use of LSD- after treatment with an SSRI-antidepressant.We strongly suggest You think again before You decide to take any anti-depressant. If you are currently taking an SSRI, never stop cold turkey but slowly taper off. Don't go off medication without medical supervision. The best way to minimize withdrawal side effects is to wean off the medication, this process may take up to a year or longer.",https://t.co/vbAE5WvbBS,others

Location matters for insulin-producing cells,"During development, cells proliferate and differentiate to enable organs to achieve their final functional architecture1. As cells develop to reach their mature state, they respond to various extrinsic cues provided by the surrounding microenvironment and acquire a fate that can be determined by their location in a tissue. But little is known about how these cues drive intracellular changes, such as transcription or differentiation, or how tissue architecture and cellular rearrangements can, in turn, affect cell fate. Writing in Nature, Mamidi et al.2 provide insight into how cell location and exposure to certain external cues can affect whether cells in the developing pancreas give rise to β-cells that make the protein insulin. Deficiencies in insulin-producing cells can lead to diabetes, so a better understanding of how these cells form could have clinical implications. As well as the hormone insulin, which has an essential role in the regulation of blood-glucose levels3, the pancreas produces digestive enzymes. The organ develops by a complex stepwise process that gives rise to many cell types3,4. Embryonic pancreatic cells, also termed progenitor cells, initially express the transcription factor PDX1 and can generate all of the cell types found in the pancreas3,5. When the pancreas begins to form, these progenitor cells are segregated into domains that give rise to specific cell lineages5. One domain forms the cells that make digestive enzymes, and the other domain, termed the trunk domain, develops from cells called bipotent pancreatic progenitors (bi-PPs) that can give rise to two cell types (Fig. 1), pancreatic duct cells and hormone-producing cells4,5. A hallmark of the bi-PP cells that will differentiate into hormone-producing cells3,4, such as β-cells, is the expression of the transcription factor NGN3. Figure 1 | Extracellular cues affect the formation of insulin-producing cells. Mamidi et al.2 used mouse and human cells to investigate what determines whether a type of cell in the developing pancreas — called a bipotent pancreatic progenitor — becomes a duct cell or a cell that makes the protein insulin. a, The authors report that duct-cell formation is associated with the presence of the protein fibronectin in the cell's microenvironment. Cellular interaction with fibronectin can be mediated by the proteins integrin-α5 and integrin-β1, which form a fibronectin receptor. This interaction is associated with cellular spreading (an increase in surface area). In such cells, the protein actin is in a filamentous form and there are high levels of the protein YAP1 in the nucleus. YAP1 represses the transcription of the gene encoding the protein NGN3, which is characteristic of the progenitor cells that will give rise to insulin-producing cells. b, The authors found that the formation of insulin-producing cells is associated with the presence of the protein laminin in the cellular microenvironment. Compared with duct cells, insulin-producing cells have lower levels of integrin-α5 (and therefore lower levels of fibronectin receptors), higher expression of the gene encoding NGN3, and less filamentous actin, cellular spreading and nuclear YAP1. Mamidi and colleagues investigated what determines the type of cell that develops from a bi-PP cell. They used experimental systems that included in vivo mouse models and in vitro studies of organ cultures and human embryonic stem cells that had differentiated to form pancreatic cells. In some of the in vitro studies, the authors used micropatterned glass slides to restrict the location and shape of the regions to which stem cells could attach and, hence, grow on. This revealed that cells confined to a limited space were more likely to differentiate into hormone-producing cells, and that cells that could spread out over a large area were less likely to form this type of cell. How might differences in cellular shape affect cell fate? The authors tested whether the protein YAP1 might be involved. YAP1 is a component of the Hippo signalling cascade, which controls organ size, and can function as a sensor of cell shape and a mediator of cellular responses to mechanical stimuli6. In the cells cultured on a micro-patterned surface, cellular spreading was associated with sustained nuclear activity of YAP1 and low levels of PDX1 and NGN3, whereas cell confinement corresponded to low levels of YAP1 in the nucleus and high levels of PDX1 and NGN3. The authors then engineered mice that lack YAP1 in their pancreatic progenitor cells. The number of insulin-expressing cells in these animals was higher than that in mice that had normal YAP1 expression, providing in vivo results that are consistent with their in vitro work. Mamidi et al. sought to define the downstream targets of YAP1 in pancreatic progenitor cells. They found that YAP1 regulates the signalling pathway that is mediated by the protein Notch, and also that YAP1 directly represses transcription of the gene that encodes NGN3.The authors also wanted to understand the pathway upstream of YAP1. How does an extracellular cue regulate YAP1, and does the same cue trigger the generation of hormone-producing cells? Changes in the arrangement of the protein actin in cells can affect YAP1 activity and cause changes in cell shape6. Using human embryonic stem cells that had differentiated into pancreatic cells and mouse pancreatic tissue grown in vitro, Mamidi et al. showed that blocking the assembly of actin into filaments resulted in cells having a reduced surface area, low nuclear YAP1 levels and high NGN3 levels, compared with cells in which filamentous actin assembly had not been perturbed. It remains to be determined exactly how actin regulation converges on a YAP1-mediated signalling pathway to govern cell fate.The most interesting aspect of Mamidi and colleagues' work is undoubtedly their finding that YAP1 activity in a cell responds to external cues from the pancreatic microenvironment that affect the assembly of actin filaments. To investigate how such external cues might affect actin and YAP1, the authors focused on integrin and FAK proteins, which function at a 'crossroads' between filamentous actin and the surrounding microenvironment. These proteins can mediate the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix material in their surroundings6. The authors report that a high level of integrin-α5 in mouse or human cells correlates with cells that are in a bi-PP state or cells that are duct progenitors, whereas low levels of this integrin are associated with the formation of hormone-producing cells. Integrin-α5 and integrin-β1 can form a receptor for the extracellular protein fibronectin7; therefore, a change in integrin expression might affect the ability of a pancreatic progenitor cell to respond to the extracellular environment in a way that affects cell fate. The authors' studies of mouse and human cells show that the presence of extracellular fibronectin promotes cellular spreading, whereas exposure to an extracellular matrix protein called laminin inhibits spreading and is accompanied by a reduction in the level of integrin-α5 and in the level of YAP1 in the nucleus. Perhaps a feedback loop based on signalling between extracellular-matrix material and integrin receptors exists in which pancreatic progenitor cells that are exposed to laminin have low expression of integrin-α5, lose the ability to respond to fibronectin, and develop into insulin-producing cells. But how the extracellular matrix might control integrin expression is an open question.Mamidi et al. suggest that regions of different extracellular-matrix composition in the developing pancreas microenvironment might exert different effects on progenitor cells, thereby influencing cell fate. The authors characterized the distribution of fibronectin and laminin in the developing mouse pancreas, and noted that the cells that will develop into insulin-producing cells are more commonly found in association with laminin than with fibronectin. However, these developing insulin-producing cells are also exposed to some fibronectin, suggesting that cells might have to respond to complex gradients of extracellular-matrix material in vivo.The authors' analysis of interactions between the extracellular matrix and cells through static 'snapshots' of the process offers a valuable starting point. However, it would be even better to understand the dynamics of the interactions in time and space in an in vivo context, given that the deposition of extracellular-matrix material and cellular positions change constantly during development. It would also be fascinating to discover which cells deposit the extracellular material that surrounds the developing pancreas.Mamidi and colleagues' work might have direct implications for efforts to generate β-cells for cell-replacement therapies to treat diabetes. Their study suggests avenues of investigation for improving the strategies used to coax human embryonic stem cells to differentiate into insulin-producing cells8.

"AMPK, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome","Effects of exerciseAs already noted, exercise increases whole-body insulin sensitivity and diminishes plasma insulin levels in humans. In addition, both epidemiological and randomized, prospective studies showed that regular exercise diminishes the likelihood that humans will develop ASCVD (35, 36) and type 2 diabetes (28, 37–39). Thus, the benefits of exercise are widely attributed to its effect on reducing whole-body IR and hyperinsulinemia. Although this explanation, which assumes a systemic effect of exercise on insulin action, still has merit, the discovery in rodents that exercise acutely increases AMPK activity in adipose tissue (40) and aortic endothelium and media (41, 42), as well as liver (40) and muscle, raises the possibility that AMPK activation in specific and underappreciated tissues contributes to its beneficial effects. For instance, in rodent aorta, treadmill running increases the activity or expression of 3 known AMPK regulators, LKB1, CAMKKβ, and SIRT1, and it concurrently activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (41), an enzyme generally thought to protect against atherogenesis in experimental animals (43). AMPK activators — pharmacological and hormonalMetformin. In 2001, metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug that modestly increases insulin sensitivity, was reported to act as an AMPK activator (44). An extended follow-up study (45) showed that metformin use was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of myocardial infarction and a 36% decrease in all-cause mortality. Furthermore, multiple studies have suggested that the incidence of many cancers is diminished in diabetic patients treated with metformin (46), although this conclusion has been questioned (47). Metformin does not act directly on LKB1 or AMPK, but rather appears to activate AMPK by modestly inhibiting complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and thus decreasing the cellular energy state (48). In liver, this decreased energy state is sufficient to diminish glucose production, even in mice lacking hepatic AMPK, indicating AMPK-independent effects of metformin. Moreover, metformin-induced accumulation of AMP, which inhibits adenylate cyclase and reduces cAMP levels and PKA activity, may be an AMPK-independent mechanism by which metformin antagonizes glucagon signaling (49). Metformin has been shown to activate AMPK in many tissues, including adipose, skeletal muscle, and heart, although, to date, evidence that genetic downregulation of AMPK prevents its biological actions has been obtained only in cultured cells. Adiponectin. AMPK is also activated by the adipokine adiponectin (50, 51). Notably, diminished serum adiponectin levels are associated with IR and appear to be a strong predictor of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in obese humans (52–54). Conversely, elevated adiponectin levels are associated with increased insulin sensitivity, a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes that is independent of obesity, and a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (52–54). Adiponectin also induces extracellular calcium influx through the adiponectin receptor 1 (55) and may have effects independent of AMPK. Thiazolidinediones and other AMPK activators. In addition to metformin, another group of type 2 diabetes drugs, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), were found to be AMPK activators (56). Although TZDs can activate AMPK in some tissues by lowering their energy state (57, 58), studies in adiponectin knockout mice strongly suggested the TZDs' ability to increase hepatic insulin sensitivity in vivo is predominantly adiponectin mediated (59, 60). TZDs are also well-established activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). As such, the adiponectin-independent mechanism of TZD-induced changes could be PPAR mediated (61). In type 2 diabetes prevention trials, metformin and TZDs independently diminished progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes by 31% (38, 39) and 70% (62), respectively, versus a 70% decrease induced by lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) (38, 39). Despite these results in preventing progression to diabetes, the use of TZDs has been curtailed recently because of potential side effects (63, 64). As reviewed elsewhere (65–67), many additional pharmacological AMPK activators have been identified or are in development, including several that directly activate AMPK (32). Likewise, some compounds already in use for improving glycemic control, such as GLP-1 receptor activators and DPP IV inhibitors (68), or in therapeutic trial, such as salicylates (69), have been shown to increase AMPK activity in a number of tissues in addition to their other actions.",https://t.co/2pL25rfUwJ,others
Injectable Insulin For Type 2 Diabetes,"Blood sugar control is one of the most important parts of type 2 diabetes management.Although you may be able to treat the condition at first with oral medication and lifestyle changes, such as exercise and weight loss, most people with type 2 diabetes eventually need to take insulin by injection.""There are several scenarios in which insulin treatment should start, including in patients with significant hyperglycemia who are symptomatic,"" explained Alaleh Mazhari, DO, an associate professor of endocrinology at Loyola Medicine in Maywood, Illinois.""In these cases, the need for insulin may be short-term. Other situations include patients who are on multiple diabetic medications with uncontrolled diabetes, and uncontrolled diabetes in pregnancy, to name a few.""Here's what you need to know about taking insulin in the short term and the long term.Insulin for Short-Term Blood Sugar ControlDoctors use a blood test called a hemoglobin A1C test to measure average blood sugar control over a two- to three-month period.The treatment target for most people with diabetes is an A1C of 7 percent or less; those with higher levels may need a more intensive medication plan.""The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends starting a person with type 2 diabetes on insulin if their A1C is above 9 percent and they have symptoms,"" said Mazhari.Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include thirst, hunger, frequent urination, and weight loss.Research published in February 2013 in the journal The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology reviewed several studies that focused on the temporary use of insulin to restore sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes.The results showed that a two- to five-week course of short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) can induce remission in patients who are early in the course of type 2 diabetes. At three months after stopping the IIT, 66 percent of patients were still in remission, and at six months, 59 percent were still in remission.Insulin for Long-Term Blood Sugar Control""After 10 to 20 years, almost all patients with type 2 diabetes will need insulin,"" Mazhari said.""Once they lose most of the cells in the pancreas that make insulin, no other diabetes medication can help. They may have been on one, two, or three diabetes medications, but their A1C can no longer be kept in a safe range.""Switching from numerous diabetes drugs to insulin can streamline your efforts.Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, so treatment plans will change. When it's not possible to meet blood sugar control goals with lifestyle changes or other medication, insulin is the next step.The change can have upsides, particularly for patients who have been on a complicated regimen of three or four drugs, with lots of side effects. Changing to insulin can actually be a lot better.Making the Switch to InsulinMaking the transition is much easier than it used to be because most patients are started on a long-acting insulin that does not need to be matched with food intake.Insulin pens that are preloaded are replacing insulin that needs to be drawn up into a syringe. Patients may still be worried about giving themselves injections, but because the needle is so tiny the adjustment is often quick.Toujeo and Lantus are long-acting forms of insulin that are available in a prefilled injectable pen.There's also a type of rapid-acting insulin, Afrezza, that can be inhaled through the mouth via an inhaler.And a new class of medication called sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is also available now, according to Mazhari. ""It works via a different pathway that's not pancreas-dependent, offering another medical therapy option for patients with type 2 diabetes.""The key to an easy transition to insulin is education.""Patients need to know how to take their insulin properly since there are many formulations on the market, including short- and long-acting insulin and premixed,"" Mazhari said. ""Most can be started on a long-acting insulin once a day, though for some patients short-acting or mealtime insulin may be necessary as well. Insulin doses need to be further adjusted depending on blood sugar readings.""Important Insulin BasicsDosing and Type Your dosing schedule and insulin type will depend on how advanced your diabetes is, plus your weight, age, level of physical activity, and the diabetic diet you're on. There's no ""standard dose"" for insulin.Self-Testing Work with your team to come up with a blood sugar testing schedule at home. You may be instructed to check your blood sugar three or four times per day during the adjustment period.Your healthcare team will use information about your fasting, pre-meal, and post-meal blood sugar levels to make changes to your insulin regimen.Hypoglycemia Learn the symptoms of low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, and what to do if you have them. The warning signs include feeling cold, shaky, dizzy, or confused. Symptoms can come on suddenly, so patients should know to drink a half-glass of juice, eat some hard candies, or chew some glucose tabs.Treatment Team During the transition, stay in close contact with your treatment team. People starting insulin are often advised to meet with their health care providers on a weekly basis until blood sugars stabilize and the appropriate insulin dose is determined.""The goal of type 2 diabetes treatment is to control blood sugar early, in order to prevent or delay the development of complications and, in those who already have them, to slow or halt their progression, if possible,"" said Mazhari.""The earlier diabetes control is achieved, the better it is for the patient. Unfortunately, in those who already have complications, some of the damage is not reversible,"" said Mazhari. ""We do our best to control diabetes using the available medications, including insulin, while working with patients to modify their diet and lifestyle.""""Obesity increases insulin resistance, but more activity and weight loss can lead to better insulin resistance and glucose control. In many cases this can help reduce the number or dose of the diabetic medication the patient is on, including insulin,"" Mazhari added.",https://t.co/8OPSdEdFQW,others
Ketosis and Insulin Resistance: How Much is Enough Carbs?,"I continue to fuel my body with ketones because of its effect on brain function. Ketosis' main attraction to most people is its ability to produce smooth, almost effortless weight loss.Ketosis makes weight loss quicker and easier.Fat Loss and the Role of InsulinWhen a patient asks for weight loss help, it often goes without saying that they are asking for help to get rid of their excess fat. No one has ever asked me to help them shed weight by trimming muscle tissue. Weight loss means getting rid of the contents stuffed in your fat-storing cells.These cells fall under the commanding leadership of a mighty ruler: INSULIN. If insulin is present, glucose molecules evacuate from your blood- mostly in to your fat storage. If there is insulin near a fat storing cell, all fat stays locked inside. If you want to use the energy of your fat cells, insulin must leave the scene. Insulin is also the chemical messenger that allows glucose into the cell. Without insulin, those extra glucose molecules never gain access to your furnaces. They remain in your bloodstream, outside your cells.Read more at the blog post about this: https://bozmd.com/ketosis-and-insulin...Using Exogenous Ketones is a great little boost to help get your body burning ketones, give you a quick hit of energy and I've even been told it's a nice little mood booster.Dr Boz BHB on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2GXLlSw Here's what one reviewer on Amazon said:""I have tried many different exogenous ketone drinks and supplements.

The Heinous Crimes Of Nurse And Serial Killer Beverley Allitt,"Beverley Allitt, also known as the ""Angel of Death,"" killed several children under her care. Her Munchhausen's by Proxy syndrome had gotten out of hand, right as she became a nurse.TwitterBeverley Allitt, seemingly harmless, and smiling.Murder has been an inherent human fear ever since our ancestors could wield rocks and sticks well enough to commit the heinous act. Serial killers are even scarier due to the relentless carnage of their patterns and the unpredictability of their evil presence. Even more terrifying are serial child killers — let alone those who happen to work as caretakers for small, defenseless kids.Beverley Allitt belonged to the latter category. Working as a State Enrolled nurse in the children's ward of the Grantham and Kesteven Hospital in Lincolnshire, England, this nurse was convicted of murdering four children, attempting to kill three others, and causing grievous bodily harm to six more. According to Biography, Allitt's killing spree took place across 59 days, spanning from winter to springs of 1991. Her methods made these atrocities even more grisly — she preferred to inject large quantities of insulin, or simply syringe-derived air bubbles into her underage victims. Wikimedia CommonsThe Grantham and Kesteven Hospital where Allitt began killing.In May 1993, Allitt was sentenced by the Nottingham Crown Court. She received thirteen life sentences, and was told by Justice Latham that she posed ""a serious danger"" to others, unless she was forcibly removed from society. Allitt — one of Britain's most infamous serial killers and known as the ""Angel of Death"" — remains behind bars to this day, at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire. As the perpetrator of these crimes has surely done herself, an exploration of her past deeds and their potential origins seems in order. From Childhood To Child KillerBeverley Gail Allitt was born on Oct. 4, 1968 in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. Even at an early age, she displayed some disconcerting behaviors that would eventually be clarified by a Munchausen's syndrome diagnosis. Allitt would unnecessarily bandage non-existent wounds and use casts to protect injuries she never sustained. Her adolescence included dramatic weight gain, and refinement of attention-seeking mannerisms and behaviors. Allitt became noticeably aggressive toward others.Throughout her youth, the teen sought attention from doctors in various hospitals. One time, she actually got what she bargained for — and had her appendix removed, which, by all accounts, was entirely healthy and functioning as it should. VIDEOBeverley Allitt: The Angel of Death documentary.The healing process was impeded throughout, as Allitt was seemingly incapable of not fidgeting with the surgical scar. She practiced this kind of self-harm, in general, and eventually had to switch doctors on a routine basis to avoid being diagnosed as potentially unfit. The most commonly accepted theory surrounding Allitt's mental evolution during this period was that her Munchausen's syndrome remained continuously incomplete. When she didn't receive the attention she desperately sought from others, her self-harm began to be redirected toward others.Unfortunately, this was right around the time Allitt decided to become a nurse. Beverley Allitt Becomes A NurseDuring her training to become a nurse, Allitt's abnormal behavior began to arise some warranted suspicion. She would smear stool on nursing home walls — when she wasn't absent from her strict training schedule, that is. Her explanations varied, but were always the same — she was sick.Allitt actually managed to nurture a romantic relationship at this time. While her boyfriend was blissfully ignorant to her behavior at work, however, he soon discovered Allitt's unhinged tendencies after hours. He later revealed she was often aggressive, deceptive, and manipulative.He also said Allitt accused him of rape. That she was pregnant. The relationship ended shortly after.TwitterAllitt, with one of her victims, and the victim's mother.Miraculously, Allitt's demented habit of smearing feces across the walls and not attending her training as required didn't prevent her from professional success. She'd failed her examinations numerous times — but was offered a six-month contract at the Grantham and Kesteven Hospital in Lincolnshire in 1991.The facility had long been understaffed, which potentially explained her employment there. Allitt was designated to work in Children's Ward 4. With only two other trained nurses on staff in that part of the hospital — one during the day shift, one for night shifts — Allitt's despicable violence toward children went undiscovered for a long, long time.Beverley Allitt Begins KillingAllitt murdered her first victim on Feb. 21, 1991. When seven-month-old Liam Taylor was admitted to her ward with a chest infection, Allitt assured his parents he as in safe hands and gently urged them to go home. When they returned, Allitt explained that the child experienced a breathing emergency, but was stable now.The following night, Liam had another respiratory emergency. The staff was confident he'd handle it without a hitch — but Allitt looked over him, and his condition quickly worsened. The boy became pale, and red splotches covering his face. Liam suffered cardiac arrest shortly after. He survived via life-support equipment, but had already suffered extensive brain damage. The parents decided to pull the plug — an agonizing decision, likely brought on by Allitt's secretive activities. TwitterBeverley Allitt, working at Grantham and Kesteven Hospital.Two weeks later, 11-year-old cerebral palsy patient Timothy Hardwick was transferred to Ward 4 after he suffered an epileptic fit. Allitt was in charge of his wellbeing. Once again, her patient experienced a respiratory issue. He was found without a pulse, turning blue — and couldn't be saved.One-year-old Kayley Desmond was Allitt's third victim. The young girl was transferred to Ward 4 on March 3, 1991, with a chest infection. Though she seemed to be recovering splendidly, Kayley went into cardiac arrest five days later — while Allitt was taking care of her. Kayley was successfully revived, and transferred to a different hospital nearby, however. This is where physicians discovered first signs of foul play — a puncture wound under her armpit, and an adjacent air bubble. Unfortunately, this was analyzed as an accidental injection, allowing Allitt to retain her shroud of secrecy. The courts were heavily criticized for allowing Allitt to enjoy relative freedom while incarcerated.Paul Crampton, a five-month-old patient with a bronchial infection, became Allitt's fourth victim. He suffered an insulin shock on March 20, 1991, and was on the verge of going into a coma three separate times. He was revived each time, but doctors were bewildered by his high insulin levelsAllitt rode to another Nottingham hospital with him. Upon arrival, his levels were once again severely abnormal. He fortunately survived. Five-year-old Bradley Gibson became her next victim. Suffering from pneumonia, he went into cardiac arrest, but was successfully resuscitated — with high insulin levels, which once again confused doctors.Allitt tended to him that night, when he suddenly had another heart attack. He was transported to another hospital, and recovered well. Even though all of these incidents had one common factor — Allitt's presence and suppose care — nobody seemed to notice, or consider the grisly possibilities.Two-year-old Yik Hung Chan turned blue on March 22, 1991, but was saved by induced oxygen. He had a second attack which resulted in a fortunate transfer, which allowed him to recover. Katie and Becky Phillips — two 2-month-old twins — were kept for observation after premature birth.VIDEOA mini-doc on Grantham and Kesteven by Nottinghamshire Healthcare.Allitt tended to Becky when she suffered from gastroenteritis on April 1, 1991. Two days later, Allitt said Becky could be hypoglycemic, and possibly cold to the touch — but nothing of note was assessed. The infant was sent home to her mother. That night, she convulsed, cried out, and died. Katie, meanwhile, was still under Allitt's care. Once more, respiratory issues occurred. While resuscitation was successful, the girl experienced the same emergency two days later. Her lungs collapsed. She was transferred to Nottingham, where it was discovered that five of her ribs were broken, and that she had severe brain damage.In a nearly inconceivable turn of events, Katie's mother was so thankful to Allitt for supposedly saving her daughter's life that she asked the ""Angel of Death"" to become Katie's godmother. She accepted — even after causing partial paralysis, cerebral palsy, and sight and hearing damage.Capture And TrialAfter four further inexplicable incidents on largely healthy patients occurred — people finally began to suspect Allitt of foul play. When 15-month-old Claire Peck died from a heart attack on April 22, 1991, the jig was nearly up. The autopsy pointed toward natural causes, but Dr. Nelson Porter, concerned by the high rates of strange deaths in the past two months, launched an official inquiry.Eighteen days later, tests uncovered abnormal levels of potassium in Claire's blood, resulting in the police being called. The girl was exhumed, and Lignocaine — a substance used to help adults during cardiac arrests — was found in her system. The police superintendent subsequently assigned Stuart Clifton to investigate what was clearly a series of purposeful crimes. Clifton examined the other strange incidents, and found a clear commonality — high levels of insulin. He then discovered that Allitt had previously reported that the key to the insulin fridge had gone missing. The nursing logs of dates covering 25 suspicious incidents, too, were gone.Beverley Allitt, finally under arrest. 1993.The policeman quickly realized that Allitt was his prime suspect, and by July of 1991, the department was confident it had enough solid evidence to charge her with murder. Nonetheless, they waited until November to avoid any irrevocable investigative missteps. Allitt appeared fairly at ease during interrogations. She denied everything, and stood firm in her claims she'd merely tried to help those kids. When police searched her home, they discovered some of the missing nursing logs. They then looked into her past, and began to realize she might've been suffering from a serious personality disorder for years. Her Munchausen's by Proxy — inflicting pain on others to garner attention — was finally a realized motive. Allitt refused to admit to what she had done, even after numerous visits and assessments by psychologists while already incarcerated. She was charged with four counts of murder, 11 counts of attempted murder, and 11 counts of causing grievous bodily harm. Allitt lost a tremendous amount of weight while awaiting trial. Her anorexia saw her shed 70 pounds. These illnesses caused a delay in her trial, which was eventually held at Nottingham Crown Court. On Feb. 15, 1993, prosecutors proved that she had been present during each abnormal incident. VIDEOAn iTV segment on the detectives and victims of Allitt's criminal life.All recorded evidence of high levels of insulin, potassium, and various injections and puncture marks were presented to the court. She was also formally accused of preventing oxygen flow to some of the victims — by smothering, or, alternatively, affecting the medical equipment.The trial also covered her childhood, with pediatrics expert Prof. Roy Meadow testifying to Munchausen's syndrome, and Munchausen's by Proxy syndrome's symptoms being extremely evident in Allitt. He also pointed to her behavior upon arrest, the amount of illnesses plaguing her life, and subsequent delay of the trail as evidence of this diagnosis. Prof. Meadows admitted that he believed Allitt would never be cured of her condition. It had simply developed and established itself for too long — she had to be removed from society protect others. The trial lasted for two months. Allitt attended it for 16 days, because she was sick.On May 23, 1993, she was hit with 13 life sentences, for murder and attempted murder. It marked the most years ever doled out to a female. Justice Latham, however, said it was a righteous punishment for the horrific cruelties she had displayed — and her cynical decision to become a nurse.The Aftermath Of Beverley Allitt's CrimesThe legacy Beverley Allitt left behind was so strong and pervasive that the Maternity Unit at Grantham and Kesteven Hospital was shut down — for good. As for Allitt, herself, the murderer was sent to Rampton Secure Hospital, rather than a traditional prison.Britain's Mental Health Act designated this high-security facility, among others, for criminals like Allitt. She resumed her attention-seeking habits soon enough. Allitt swallowed glass on one occasion and poured boiling water on her hand on another. Since then, she finally admitted to three of the murders, and six of the assaults. The U.K.'s Home Office officially categorized Allitt as one of the few criminals who would never be eligible for parole, due to the simple gravity of her crimes.During her life as a prisoner, the father of her first victim, Liam, Chris Taylor has publicly denounced Rampton as a sham. Taylor claimed the facility is mere daycare for people who should be treated as serious criminals.To his point, the facility has around 1,400 employees — and 400 inmates. In May, 2005, The Mirror reported that Allitt received over $40,000 in State benefits since she was imprisoned in 1993. In 2006, Allitt applied for review. The Probation Service subsequently contacted the families of her victims — as of yet, Allitt is still behind bars.After learning about the heinous crimes of nurse and serial killer Beverley Allitt, check out 21 serial killer quotes that will chill you to the bone.

Blueberry Bioactives,"Improve insulin sensitivity with blueberries and you'll build muscle and lose fat faster. Here's how. by Chris Shugart It's often called the most anabolic hormone of all... and it's not testosterone. It's insulin.But insulin is a two-faced ""frenemy."" How your body handles insulin can drive both muscle gain andfat gain. If you want to manipulate insulin to your advantage, then you need to increase your insulin sensitivity i.e. become less insulin resistant. This will result in less body fat storage and the ability to build muscle easier, especially if you incorporate peri-workout nutrition tactics in this insulin-sensitive state.Sound good? Then you need to eat more blueberries.A recent study showed that dietary supplementation with the bioactives from whole blueberries improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant individuals. Basically, researchers gave fat (but non-diabetic) participants two blueberry smoothies per day for six weeks. At the end of the study, 67% showed a 10% or greater improvement in their insulin sensitivity.Since more than half of the American population is predicted to have diabetes or be prediabetic by 2020 (which would amount to a gut-shot to the healthcare system) this is good news. For the physique-focused gym rat, eating blueberries or supplementing with blueberry concentrates could result in more muscle-building and less fat-building over time.Adding fresh or frozen blueberries to a couple of protein shakes every day will help. Another option is to simply use Superfood, which contains freeze-dried organic blueberries with the same bioactivity as fresh.Remember, insulin can be your friend or your enemy. It's up to you to tell it what to do. It looks like consuming blueberries is one way to do that.Study: Bioactivesin Blueberries Improve Insulin Sensitivity in Obese, Insulin-Resistant Men and Women.

Skeletal muscle Nur77 and NOR1 insulin responsiveness is blunted in obesity and type 2 diabetes but improved after exercise training.,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are characterized by a blunted metabolic response to insulin, and strongly manifests in skeletal muscle insulin resistance. The orphan nuclear receptors, Nur77 and NOR1, regulate insulin-stimulated nutrient metabolism where Nur77 and NOR1 gene expression is increased with acute aerobic exercise and acute insulin stimulation. Whether Nur77 or NOR1 are associated with the insulin-sensitizing effects of chronic aerobic exercise training has yet to be elucidated. Fourteen lean healthy controls (LHC), 12 obese (OB), and 10 T2DM individuals (T2DM) underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with skeletal muscle biopsies. Muscle was analyzed for Nur77 and NOR1 gene and protein expression at basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, a subcohort of 18 participants (OB, n = 12; T2DM, n = 6) underwent a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention (85% HRmax , 60 min/day, 5 days/week). In response to insulin infusion, LHC increased protein expression of Nur77 (8.7 ± 3.2-fold) and NOR1 (3.6 ± 1.1-fold), whereas OB and T2DM remained unaffected. Clamp-derived glucose disposal rates correlated with Nur77 (r2 = 0.14) and NOR1 (r2 = 0.12) protein expression responses to insulin, whereas age (Nur77: r2 = 0.22; NOR1: r2 = 0.25) and BMI (Nur77: r2 = 0.22; NOR1: r2 = 0.42) showed inverse correlations, corroborating preclinical data. In the intervention cohort, exercise improved Nur77 protein expression in response to insulin (PRE: -1.2 ± 0.3%, POST: 6.2 ± 1.5%). Also, insulin treatment of primary human skeletal muscle cells increased Nur77 and NOR1 protein. These findings highlight the multifactorial nature of insulin resistance in human obesity and T2DM. Understanding the regulation of Nur77 and NOR1 in skeletal muscle and other insulin-sensitive tissues will create opportunities to advance therapies for T2DM.© 2019 The Authors.

Insulin Temperature Control: What You Need to Know,"Earlier this year, our own Wil Dubois landed in the ER with DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) that seemingly came out of nowhere. This was a wake-up call for him to revisit the basics of type 1 diabetes management, including the importance of keeping your insulin temperature-safe so you know it's working properly. Recognizing Spoiled Insulin What happens when you leave a chunk of raw prime rib out in the sun? Right. After a while, it starts to stink. Guess what? Insulin is the same. Just like prime rib, it's a protein. And just like prime rib, it can spoil in high temperatures.Of course, spoiled insulin doesn't smell rancid. It still smells like Band-Aids. And it doesn't change color, or give you any other clues that it's spoiled. It just stops working, or at a minimum it stops working properly, leaving you with blood sugars that start to climb and a need for multiple correction doses that just don't seem to be making any impact. You probably knew that, or at least you probably did at one time. But do you know how hot is too hot? Or how long insulin can beat the heat? There are many options nowadays to keep our insulin at ideal temps whether we're at home, traveling on planes and trains, or out in the wild where weather extremes can present different medication challenges.Share on Pinterest What's the Best Temperature to Store Insulin? The three major insulin makers -- Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi -- tell us that ""refrigeration temperatures between 36° and 46°F are maintained for insulin products during the manufacturing process"" and that remains the recommended range. They also warn strongly against putting insulin in the freezer, or directly adjacent to the refrigerator cooling element, as freezing renders insulin immediately ineffective. According to Consumer Reports, the sweet spot for a kitchen fridge is 37° F -- apparently ideal for keeping veggies like lettuce free of ice crystals, while suppressing the spread of bacteria. But that's pretty close to the bottom of the ideal insulin temp range, so we need to be careful. Many people with diabetes have a habit of taking their insulin directly from the pharmacy to the kitchen fridge. While this is generally good enough, it's important to be alert to colder corners and know that the overall temperature of a full fridge can be lower than the temperature in a nearly empty one. The butter compartment generally remains a good choice of fridge placement for insulin, as it turns out. Now let's turn to the specific insulin you may be using. Target Temperatures, by Insulin Brand and TypeDo different insulins have different recommended temperatures for safe storage? Starting with Novo Nordisk, the company that makes more kinds of insulin than anyone else, here's the official word on product storage:Long-acting (basal) insulin Levemir, should be kept in a refrigerator at that sweet spot between 36° and 46° Fahrenheit. Novo tells us that once unopened, vials or pens can be kept safely at room temperature so long as they are protected from heat sources and direct sunlight, and that the medicine will still function for up to 42 days. Apparently, on day 43, it turns into a pumpkin. Wait, what? How is room temp defined? Well, the problem may be that Novo Nordisk is a Danish company, and it's cooler in Denmark than in Phoenix, Arizona, or lots of other places. Their official safe room temp for insulin no hotter than 86° F. Meanwhile, open in-use pens and vials, ""must NOT be stored in a refrigerator"" (the capital letter emphasis is Novo's), and have the same 42-day life that unopened room temp Levemir has. Fast-acting (bolus) insulin Novolog has the same temperature ranges, for both unopened or in use, but a shorter (Danish) room temperature lifespan: 28 days. It also has an additional interesting note: Six-days max life in an insulin pump reservoir, unless exposed to temperatures in excess of 98.6° F, in which case it needs to be pitched out.Pumpers: Don't snuggle up with someone running a mild fever. OK, and what about the newest insulin formulations from Novo? Are they more robust than our old standbys? Nope. Ultra fasting-acting Fiasp has the exact same recommendations as Novolog. Ultra long-acting basal insulin Tresiba has the same temps and rules as Levemir, except it apparently lasts a full 56 days at Danish room temps. What about other brands and formulations? They all have the same 36° to 46° range: Sanofi's fasting-acting Apidra, and Lilly's long-acting Humalog/Admelog, Lantus/Basaglar, and Toujeo.What about insulin mixes? And non-insulin injectable diabetes medications? Yup, they all recommend exactly the same temperature range for safe storage. Just flip to section 16 of the Prescribing Information sheet (basically the Bible for each med) to confirm its ideal temperature range. Still, just for fun, let's look at old-school insulin. Was pioneer insulin tougher?Looking at the data for Novolin R and N—the forerunners of the forerunners of today's insulins—they too, have the magic 36° and 46° F range, but I guess due to global warming, room temps were cooler back then: 77 degrees. And what about farther back in time? How about animal insulin? We couldn't find any data for them online (as these insulins predate the Internet), but Merck's Vetsulin, a pig-based veterinary insulin for cats and dogs, interestingly, it has the exact same temp range. We queried all the major insulin players on where this temperature standard originated, but didn't get much information. Novo was the only company to respond, with their Director of Diabetes Communications Michael Bachner writing to say he was unable to locate any sources on why storage temperature ""hasn't changed over the years with newer insulin formulations."" Tools for Keeping Insulin CoolThe good news is that working insulin—the open vials and pens you're actively using—doesn't need to be kept cool. In use, there's no benefit to actually keeping insulin cold. It will neither prolong its life nor make it work better, plus cold insulin stings when you inject it. The trick is not so much keeping your open insulin cool when in use, but rather, to not let it get hot.To do this, you just need to make sure your house, work place, car, purse/go-bag, and pocket never get hotter than the top level of Danish room temperature (than 86° F), which nearly every house, work place, car, purse/go-bag, and pocket is sure to hit in the summer here in the USA.So what to do?Ice packs were the traditional solution. But while ice packs are great for post-surgical swelling, and may yet be useful in treating hangovers, as a means of keeping insulin cool they're woefully ineffective. The ice melts quickly, they're messy, plus they actually keep insulin cooler than it needs to be, at least for working insulin. Ice packs might be a good solution for transporting an inventory of insulin for an extended vacation, but that's about it.Thankfully there are some great products to help solve this problem: Medicool, which has been around for quite a while, specializes in a wide range of insulated coolers with a molded insert that needs to be frozen, then re-frozen to be used again. It's a small step up from an ice bag, at least in terms of being less messy, but refreezing takes time. The company also sells a small portable refrigerator.Personally, I'm a big fan of the Frio cooling wallets, which are light, simple, compact, and easy to use. They use evaporative cooling to keep insulin in that sub-80 range for 48 hours, even when the outside temps are well above 100 degrees. To re-use, you just soak the inner sleeve in water and you're good to go. Frios have the advantage of working in reverse, too, protecting insulin from getting too cold in freezing weather.Zhengzhou Dison Electric Co, Ltd. makes a variety of models of portable refrigerators for medicine. How large a variety? How does 62 different models sound to you?A new trend in insulin temp control is the use of stainless thermos technology such as the Insulin Safe and its cousins, which can be found on Amazon, eBay, and Aliexpress/Alibaba. The novel Vivi products replace the cap of most of the disposable insulin pens on the market, and use phase change material to keep insulin at steady temps for up to 12 hours without electricity, water, or refrigeration. It magically starts working at around 84° and holds the insulin at 82° for either one or two days, depending on the model. They also make a version of their device for insulin vials.MedAngel, a compact Bluetooth thermometer you can use to monitor the temperature of your insulin stash while you're traveling.So while you can't leave a chunk of raw prime rib lying around in the sun for too long, you can throw it into your freezer, and thaw it out months later for a good meal. That is sadly not true of insulin, so remember the basics: don't freeze it, and don't let your insulin get hot.",https://t.co/OSZdYHrNFf,others

Human duct cells contribute to β cell compensation in insulin resistance,"Glucose homeostasis and metabolic parameters in pregnant LIRKO mice. During late pregnancy, mothers develop relative insulin resistance to accommodate an appropriate supply of nutrients to the fetus (12). To assess whether superimposing pregnancy in insulin-resistant LIRKO (35) mice is able to activate generation of new β cells from additional reserves, we phenotyped the animals before, during, and after pregnancy. Although both control and LIRKO mice gained significant weight during the progression of pregnancy/gestation (G), no significant differences were observed between groups before or during pregnancy or in the postpartum (P) periods (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.99576DS1). As expected, serum insulin levels in control mice increased during pregnancy, resulting in reduced blood glucose levels (Figure 1, A and B). The higher circulating insulin levels in nonpregnant (G0) LIRKO mice further increased and remained consistently higher during pregnancy, with elevated blood glucose levels peaking on day G15.5 and returning to normal levels on P4 (Figure 1, A and B).Figure 1Compensatory islet hyperplasia in pregnant LIRKO mice. (A) Serum insulin (n = 3–9 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test) and (B) blood glucose levels (n = 3–7 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test) in female control and LIRKO mice measured before gestation (G0), during (G15.5, G17.5) pregnancy, and after (P4 and P10) pregnancy.

In addition, the impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant LIRKO mice worsened around midpregnancy (G15.5) (Figure 1C and Supplemental Figure 1C). The LIRKO mice also exhibited a relatively severer insulin resistance compared with controls in both nonpregnant and pregnant states (Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure 1D), consistent with our previous report (36), supporting the notion that the pregnant LIRKO mouse is a suitable model to investigate pathways that contribute to expanding the β cell pool during extreme demands.LIRKO mice exhibit ability to further enhance proliferation ofβcells during pregnancy. To evaluate the effects of superimposing pregnancy in a genetic model that already exhibits compensatory islet hyperplasia, we systematically examined islet architecture, islet cell composition, and β cell proliferation, size, mass, and apoptosis. Analysis of islet morphology in the pancreas sections of control pregnant or nonpregnant mice showed a relatively normal islet cell distribution pattern with a core of β cells and non–β cells forming the mantle (Figure 1E). In contrast, and especially in pregnant LIRKO mice, the core and majority (90%–95%) of the periphery of the hyperplastic islets were almost exclusively composed of β cells, with a lower percentage of α and δ cells accumulated in one-half of the islet (Figure 1E).Analyses of cells within each islet showed a dramatically increased β cell number in both nonpregnant (G0) and pregnant LIRKO mice (Figure 1F). Furthermore, the islet endocrine cell composition revealed that, although the β cell population was further increased in pregnant mice in both groups, the proportions of glucagon- and somatostatin-producing cells were significantly lower during and following pregnancy only in the LIRKO mice (Figure 1G). The increase in β cells from G0 to G15.5 in control mice was secondary to enhanced proliferation as shown by an increase in Ki67+ β cells followed by a decrease to nonpregnant levels after birth (Figure 1, H and I, and Supplemental Table 1). In contrast, the approximately 2-fold increase in β cell proliferation in LIRKO mice, compared with control animals at G0, went up further, approximately 4-fold, by G15.5 and decreased to control levels postpartum (P0 and P4) (Figure 1, H and I, and Supplemental Table 1). The β cell proliferation was confirmed by immunostaining for the M phase proliferation marker, phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) (Supplemental Figure 2, A and B, and Supplemental Table 1), and was consistent with the total β cells per mm2 of pancreas area (Supplemental Figure 2C). Although α cell proliferation showed a decrease in pregnant control mice, the LIRKO mice exhibited significantly lower α cell proliferation before, during, and after pregnancy (Supplemental Figure 2, D and E) consistent with the islet cell composition in LIRKO mice shown in Figure 1G. Whether this decrease in α cells is because some of them are contributing to the increased β cell pool during pregnancy requires further investigation.Similar to the effects on proliferation, β cell mass and area increased during pregnancy in both groups and decreased postpartum compared with nonpregnant states. In striking contrast, pregnant LIRKO mice showed an additional significant increase in β cell mass and area after G15.5 that peaked at P0 compared with controls at the same time point (Figure 1, J and K, and Supplemental Figure 2F). Furthermore, cell size assessed by coimmunostaining for β-catenin and insulin did not show statistically significant differences between control and LIRKO mice before, during, or after pregnancy (Supplemental Figure 2, G and H). β Cell apoptosis evaluated by TUNEL-labeling did not show differences between control and LIRKO mice at G15.5 (Supplemental Figure 2I). Overall, these results suggest that in addition to replication, LIRKO mice mobilize non–β cells to further enhance β cell numbers during pregnancy, and this prompted us to speculate about other sources of β cells.Alterations in pregnancy hormones and serotonin in LIRKO mice. Pregnancy hormones have been a focus of study as important stimuli to drive β cell proliferation during pregnancy (18). Surprisingly, prolactin and progesterone levels were significantly decreased in LIRKO mice during pregnancy while only estradiol levels were increased at G15.5 in LIRKO compared with control mice (Supplemental Figure 3, A–C). Despite the dramatic difference in pregnancy hormones, the duration of pregnancy and litter sizes were similar between groups (36). Furthermore, the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that has been implicated in pregnancy hormone–induced increase in β cell mass (17), was higher in the LIRKO mice compared with control mice (Supplemental Figure 4, A–G). Although we did not observe differences in expression of serotonin receptors between groups (data not shown), additional work is necessary to explore the role of serotonin, if any, in promoting an increase in β cell mass in the LIRKO model.Increased insulin+ ductal cells and small islet clusters adherent to ducts in pregnant LIRKO mice. To investigate the direct role of ductal cells in the expansion of β cell mass, we first examined the incidence of cells that were double positive for insulin and the duct marker, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA). Control mice showed an increase in insulin and DBA double-positive cells during pregnancy that reduced to nonpregnant levels in the postpartum period (Figure 2, A and B). Although LIRKO dams revealed a similar pattern, the number of insulin+ cells in the duct epithelium was significantly higher during and after the first 4 days postpartum (Figure 2, A and B). Notably, glucagon+ ductal cells were also significantly higher at G17.5 in pregnant LIRKO mice (Supplemental Figure 5A). It is possible that the increase in DBA/glucagon double-positive cells represents a compensation for reduced α cell content during late pregnancy (Figure 1G).Figure 2Insulin+ ductal cells and small islet clusters localized close to ducts are increased in LIRKO mice during pregnancy. (A) Representative immunofluorescence images obtained from control and LIRKO mice before, during, and after pregnancy and stained for insulin (shown in blue), glucagon (shown in red) and ductal marker DBA (shown in green). Insets point to DBA and insulin+ cells. (B) Quantification of DBA and insulin double-positive cells in pregnant and nonpregnant control and LIRKO mice (n = 3–5 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test).

(D) Quantification of the distance of scattered islet clusters (fewer than 10 islet cells) from the ducts. Groups are shown as percentage of total scattered islets that were counted (n = 3 pancreas sections analyzed per group for each time point, 2-tailed Student's t test).

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. #P, §P, and *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01.Neogenesis is characterized by an increase in the number of small islet clusters (37). Indeed, we also observed an increase in scattered small islet clusters before, during, and after pregnancy in LIRKO mothers that reached significance at G15.5 (control: 0.2 scattered islets/mm2 vs. LIRKO: 0.6 scattered islets/mm2, P = 0.008) (Supplemental Figure 5B). We also observed islet clusters that appeared to be virtually adherent to ducts in the LIRKO mice, especially at G15.5 (G0: 10.1% control vs. 21.2% LIRKO, P = 0.06; and G15.5: 10.5% control vs. 37.8% LIRKO, P = 0.002 of total small islet clusters, respectively) (Figure 2, C and D). The percentage of small islet clusters that were located less than or equal to 5 μm from ducts was higher in LIRKO mice during the transition from G17.5 to P4 (Figure 2D). These data suggest that neogenesis is a contributor to the compensatory β cell pool.The duct epithelium contributes to islet endocrine cell formation. The lack of a phenotype in animals with KO of insulin receptors in ducts (S. Bonner-Weir, Joslin Diabetes Center, personal communication) encouraged us to use duct-specific, carbonic anhydrase–driven Cre and floxed insulin receptor mice to develop an inducible lineage trace model to directly examine whether duct cells are a source of new β cells. To this end we bred tamoxifen-inducible (TM-inducible) carbonic anhydrase II–CreERTM R26R-eYFP (reporter–enhanced yellow fluorescence protein, eYFP) (38) mice with LIRKO animals (Figure 3A). Offspring, carrying the carbonic anhydrase II–driven (CAII-driven) Cre transgene and homozygous for both eYFP and loxP-targeted insulin receptor, were grouped based on the absence (Lox-YFP) or presence (LIRKO-YFP) of the albumin promoter–driven Cre transgene, respectively. Because animals receiving either continuous or 5-day injections of TM during pregnancy had spontaneous abortions, we limited the injections to 3 days (100 mg/kg) starting at G10.5 followed by harvesting of pancreases on day G15.5. Untreated groups were included as controls, and no YFP+ staining was detectable. As expected, the labeling efficiency was relatively low in the TM-treated group; nevertheless, confocal microscopy of samples from TM-treated pregnant and nonpregnant Lox-YFP and LIRKO-YFP mice demonstrated YFP-marked, insulin+ cells in pancreatic islets that were localized close to ductal epithelium (Figure 3B). Control pregnant mice (G15.5) exhibited increased YFP-marked, insulin+ cells compared with nonpregnant animals (Figure 3C), and this number was further increased in pregnant LIRKO-YFP (by approximately 2.3-fold vs. pregnant Lox-YFP, P = 0.07; and by approximately 5-fold vs. nonpregnant LIRKO-YFP mice, P = 0.03), providing direct genetic evidence of ductal contribution to new β cells. Although we did not find any insulin+, YFP+, or SOX9+ cells in G0 and G15.5 Lox-YFP mice, the data in the lineage-tracing studies were supported by the observation of insulin+, YFP+ and SOX9+ ductal cells in pregnant LIRKO-YFP mice and insulin and SOX9 double-positive ductal cells in nonpregnant LIRKO-YFP animals (Supplemental Figure 6A). Moreover, YFP and pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX1) immunostaining revealed double-positive islet β cells only in LIRKO-YFP mice and were observed to be higher during pregnancy (G15.5) (Supplemental Figure 6B). The specificity to generate only β cells by lineage tracing was confirmed by lack of coexpression of YFP and α cell markers (Supplemental Figure 6C).Figure 3The duct epithelium contributes to islet endocrine cell formation. (A) Experimental strategy showing CAII-CreERTM R26R-eYFP mice crossed to Alb-Cre InsRfl/fl animals to generate Lox-YFP and LIRKO-YFP mice and subsequently rendered pregnant.

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05.Humanβcell proliferation is increased in response to pregnancy in NOD/SCID-γLIRKO mice transplanted with human islets. To examine the translational significance of the dramatic increase in β cell mitosis in pregnant LIRKO mice (G15.5), we crossed LIRKO animals with immunodeficient NOD/SCID-γ (NSG) mice (Figure 4A), to allow for human tissue engraftment (39). Offspring carrying albumin promoter–driven Cre transgene (NSG-LIRKO mice) continued to exhibit an insulin-resistant phenotype that was similar to the original LIRKO phenotype (Supplemental Figure 7, A–F, and ref. 40). Next, female NSG-Lox (control) and NSG-LIRKO mice were rendered pregnant following transplantation of human islets (for donor information, see Supplemental Table 2) under the kidney capsule (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 8A), and the islet grafts bearing kidneys and endogenous pancreases were harvested at G15.5. The detection of human insulin and C-peptide in mouse serum confirmed graft survival and functioning human islets at tissue harvest. The average human insulin values (all approximate) were NSG-Lox: 3 mU/L (G0) and 8 mU/L (G15.5); NSG-LIRKO: 39 mU/L (G0) and 116 mU/L (G15.5). The average human C-peptide values (all approximate) were NSG-Lox: 102 mU/L (G0) and 297 mU/L (G15.5); NSG-LIRKO: 863 mU/L (G0) and 497 mU/L (G15.5). Analysis of BrdU incorporation and Ki67 immunostaining revealed a significant increase in human β cell proliferation in islet grafts obtained from pregnant NSG-Lox mice compared with nonpregnant controls (Figure 4, B–D; Supplemental Figure 8, A and B; and Supplemental Table 3). The level of human β cell proliferation in nonpregnant NSG-LIRKO mice was comparable to pregnant NSG-Lox mice, whereas a significant (P = 0.04) increase was evident in pregnant NSG-LIRKO mice compared with their corresponding controls (pregnant NSG-Lox) (Figure 4, B–D; Supplemental Figure 8, A and B; and Supplemental Table 3). Similar results were observed with the proliferation marker, pHH3 (Supplemental Figure 8C and Supplemental Table 3). Finally, consistent with the data in LIRKO mice (Figure 1H), and human islet transplantation studies (Figure 4, B–D, and Supplemental Figure 8C), endogenous pancreatic islets from G15.5 NSG-LIRKO mice demonstrated a significant increase in β cell proliferation (analyzed by BrdU, Ki67, or pHH3) compared with G15.5 NSG-Lox or G0 NSG-LIRKO mice (Supplemental Figure 9, A–C, and Supplemental Table 3). These results clearly point to stimulatory effects in response to increased insulin demand in both human and mouse islets.Figure 4β Cell proliferation is increased in response to pregnancy in human islets transplanted into NSG-LIRKO mice. (A) Experimental strategy showing NSG mice crossed with LIRKO mice to generate NSG-Lox and NSG-LIRKO female mice, followed by transplantation of human islets (1,000 islet equivalents [IEQ]) under the kidney capsule. Ten days after transplantation, mice were rendered pregnant and then sacrificed at G15.5 following BrdU injection. Nonpregnant mice transplanted with human islets were used as controls.

To further examine the translational relevance of our findings, we undertook an alternative transplantation approach and transplanted human pancreatic ductal ""aggregates"" together with human islets from the same donor (Figure 4A; for donor information, see Supplemental Table 2) in a ratio that mimics the pancreatic microenvironment. One striking observation in the duct cells was a significant increase in number of proliferating cells that was already evident in the nonpregnant (G0) NSG-LIRKO mice and increased even further at G15.5 (Figure 5, A and B). Further work is necessary to examine the consequences of this increased ductal proliferation.Figure 5Enhanced proliferation and presence of markers of endocrine progenitors and mature β cell markers in duct cells in response to pregnancy in NSG-LIRKO mice cotransplanted with human ducts and human islets.

We transplanted 1,000 human IEQ with 100 ductal aggregates. (J) Insulin+ duct cells are expressed as percentage of total duct cells (n = 3–4 mice per group, 2-tailed Student's t test). Scale bars: 25 μm (A–H), 10 μm (I). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, and ***P &lt; 0.001.To explore whether the compensatory increase in proliferating duct cells is a prelude to inducing differentiation toward the β cell lineage, we immunostained the sections for key transcription factors known to be expressed during development of the endocrine pancreas (Figure 5C). Coimmunostaining for human duct–specific cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and transcription factor sex-determining region Y box 9 (SOX9) showed distinct nuclear staining for SOX9 in the NSG-Lox group while several duct cells were SOX9– the NSG-LIRKO group, implying some duct cells were differentiating toward the endocrine lineage (Figure 5D). This was supported by the presence of the endocrine progenitor marker neuronal differentiation (NeuroD1) in duct cells in pregnant NSG-LIRKO mice only (Figure 5E). Although human duct grafts in both NSG-Lox and NSG-LIRKO mice were virtually negative for paired box 6 (PAX6) staining, NSG-LIRKO (G0) mice demonstrated PAX6+ human duct cells that were more frequently detected in pregnant NSG-LIRKO mice (Figure 5F). The mature β cell markers PDX1 and V-Maf Musculoaponeurotic Fibrosarcoma Oncogene Homolog A (MAFA) were observed more frequently in the pregnant NSG-LIRKO group (Figure 5, G and H). Finally, the percentage of insulin and CK19 double-positive cells was significantly higher in pregnant NSG-LIRKO mice compared with nonpregnant NSG-LIRKO mice and pregnant NSG-Lox animals (Figure 5, I and J). These results, from the first study to our knowledge where human ductal cells and islets were cotransplanted into mice and tracked for duct to endocrine cell change during pregnancy, indicate that increased insulin demand drives human ductal cells toward a β or β-like cell identity.Insulin+ duct cells and small islet clusters are increased in human pregnancy and patients with T2D. To obtain further translational evidence for a ductal source of β cells, we screened pancreas sections from human control and pregnant (physiological insulin resistance) samples as well as female patients with T2D (pathological insulin resistance) obtained from the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors (nPOD) (for donor information, see Supplemental Table 2; because of the limited number of pregnant patient samples at nPOD, we decided to match the BMI of the patients with T2D cases with the pregnant cases because both are models of insulin resistance). Indeed, confocal microscopic analysis revealed a significant presence of insulin+ ductal cells in both pregnant and T2D patients (Figure 6, A and B). Quantification of islet clusters, as evidence of neogenesis (37), revealed an approximately 3-fold increase in small clusters located close to ductal epithelium in both pregnant and T2D groups compared with controls (Figure 6, C and D). Moreover, while pancreatic islets adherent to CK19+ ductal cells tended to increase in pregnancy (P = 0.07), they reached statistical significance in T2D samples (Figure 6, E and F). Interestingly, we observed insulin and glucagon double-positive clusters that appeared to be budding from ducts (Figure 6G), and CK19+ ducts were positive for multiple islet endocrine hormones (Figure 6H) in both pregnant and female T2D cadaver samples, similar to a previous report on distal pancreatectomy in humans (41). Consistent with the mouse data (Figure 2D), analysis of pregnancy samples showed an increase in small islet clusters adjacent or closely localized to pancreatic ducts compared with nonpregnant controls (control 3.17% vs. pregnant 23.54%, P = 0.017) (Figure 6I). Finally, to provide additional evidence of β cell proliferation in response to insulin resistance, we screened pancreas sections from human control, pregnant, and T2D patients obtained from nPOD (for donor information, see Supplemental Table 2). Although β cell replication detected by Ki67 immunostaining was minimal in controls and virtually absent in T2D, the frequency was higher in pregnant patients during the last trimester. Although the total number of patients in the pregnancy group is limited and precludes statistical significance, it is notable that β cell proliferation correlates with the duration of pregnancy (Supplemental Figure 10, A and B).Figure 6Presence of markers of endocrine progenitors and mature β cells in duct cells and increased numbers of small islet clusters in human pregnant and T2D samples.

We next explored whether the ductal cells in sections from human cadaver pancreas showed presence of endocrine pancreatic differentiation markers similar to the experiment with the human islet and duct grafts (Figure 5, D–H). Coimmunostaining for human duct–specific CK19 and SOX9 showed nuclear staining for SOX9 in control cases while insulin-resistant samples showed ductal cells predominantly negative for SOX9 (Figure 6J). Although we did not detect any PDX1+ or PAX6+ ductal cells in controls, they were clearly increased in insulin-resistant individuals (Figure 6, K and L). Finally, the mature β cell marker, MAFA, was detected only in the ducts from the pregnant group (Figure 6M). These results suggest that, during increased insulin demand such as physiological or pathophysiological insulin resistance, ductal cells are mobilized to attain a β cell identity.",https://t.co/npp6R95klh,others

Diasome's Liver Targeted Insulin,"Robert Geho, CEO of Diasome Pharmaceuticals, Inc.We spoke with Robert Geho, CEO of Diasome Pharmaceuticals, Inc. — www.diasome.com — about its nanotechnology additive that delivers insulin to the liver where it can substantially improve T1D glucose control.Normal vs Injected Insulin In normal human physiology, the liver stores glucose at mealtime when insulin is released by the pancreas to prevent hyperglycemia and releases glucose when it senses glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia. This critical capability of the liver is mostly bypassed with injected insulin since nearly all of this insulin is absorbed by muscle and fat and does not reach the liver. In contrast, muscle doesn't have glucagon receptors, so injected glucagon must directly stimulate liver action for glucose release to counteract hypoglycemia.Without liver-regulated glucose control, managing blood glucose is much more difficult. Faster and longer-acting insulins help, as do pumps and CGMs, but the fine-grained control of liver function promises much better control for people with T1D. Strong BondsDiasome nanotechnology creates strong bonds with insulin molecules that prevent insulin absorption by muscle and fat and enables that insulin to reach the liver where it can support normal physiological function. These strong bonds do not slow insulin action or diminish the duration of action. In fact, early studies show that getting more insulin to the liver speeds initial action and improves time in range. The company has developed hepatocyte directed vesicle (HDV) nanotechnology as an insulin additive. Their HDV nanotechnology is insulin-agnostic and has the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of all insulins by restoring the liver's natural role in glucose control. This applies to basal and bolus insulins, whether dosed via MDI or pumps.Shelf LifeHDV has the same shelf life as insulin or better, whether refrigerated or at room temperature. The combined HDV insulin product may be more stable and have improved shelf life.Phase 2 StudyDiasome's Phase 2 study, which just started enrolling patients, is ""designed to provide additional dosing guidance based on recently analyzed Phase 2 and Phase 2b clinical data,"" said W. Blair Geho, M.D., Ph.D., chief scientific officer of Diasome. This study is designed to optimize the ratio of long-acting to short-acting insulin therapies when using HDV.This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the effect of HDV added to insulin on a variety of standard diabetes outcomes including HbA1c, hypoglycemia, and bolus and basal insulin dosing in adult type 1 diabetes subjects whose starting HbA1c levels are between 6.5% and 8.5%. Diasome intends to enroll approximately sixty participants who will undergo a three-month run-in period on the standard of care therapy followed by three months of treatment with HDV plus insulin along with different long-acting insulin dosing rates. Douglas Muchmore, M.D., chief technology officer of Diasome, said, ""As the most clinically advanced developer of liver-targeted insulin in the industry, we continue to address where insulin goes after it is injected because of the critical importance of the liver in glucose metabolism."" Solution NeededRecent data from the top 80 US endocrinology clinics showed that mean A1C increased from 7.8% to 8.4% in the period 2010 to 2016 despite increased uptake of medical device technologies such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring use and faster, longer acting insulins. Tremendous strides have been made and more advances are coming but the cost of these advanced technologies and insulins is a huge barrier to wider adoption,"" said Robert Geho. ""We believe that Diasome's better biodistribution of insulin could provide much more cost-effective improved glucose control and could see wide adoption."" Liver ToxicityLilly and Novo abandoned their efforts to develop an insulin additive that limited fat and muscle absorption. Lilly went the farthest in its efforts, but its clinical trials showed unexpected liver fat and enzyme toxicity.Diasome's approach does not change the underlying structure of insulin. Instead, their approach is based on a charge-based bonding of the insulin molecules. This non-chemical approach has not shown any liver toxicity issues.Phase 3 TimingDiasome expects to begin Phase 3 Clinical Trials in early 2020 and if approved, hopes to have HDV additives in the market by 2022.Dosing ScenariosThere are multiple ways in which Diasome envisions HDV's integration into patient treatment. Diasome would welcome partnering with insulin manufacturers such as Novo and Lily such that HDV was pre-mixed with insulinsLocal pharmacies could add HDV to insulin vials they sellIndividual patients could add HDV to insulin they have purchasedDiasome has tested a broad range of HDV-to-Insulin mixture ratios and believes that HDV has a wide safety margin so patient mixing could be feasible.One very interesting aspect of HDV is that when mixed with older insulins the action profiles of these off patent and cheaper insulins are much improved which could lead many people to re-adopt NPH into their insulin regimen.CompanyDiasome has an oral HDV insulin capsule in its development pipeline. This oral capsule also has great promise because the HDV liver targeting system enables oral doses of insulin that are similar to injected insulin doses. Usually, much larger oral insulin doses are required because of the digestive system's ability to break insulin molecules down, but the HDV insulin appears to protect insulin from this barrier. Diasome was founded in 2004 and has raised multiple rounds of funding, including support from the JDRF T1D Fund in Boston. The most recent funding was in October 2018.Supporting ResearchTargeting insulin to the liver corrects defects in glucose metabolism caused by peripheral insulin delivery — article linkState of Type 1 Diabetes Management and Outcomes from the T1D Exchange in 2016–2018 — Diabetes Technology &amp; Therapeutics, Volume 21, Number 2, 2019, DOI: 10.1089/dia.2018.0384",https://t.co/ddJIGc07Da,others

No direct effect of SGLT2 activity on glucagon secretion,"AcknowledgementsWe thank M. Lal (AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden) for providing the human kidney tissue.Contribution statementREK and JJH conceived the study. REK and DBA designed perfusion experiments and performed isolated perfused rat pancreas experiments and assayed for glucagon, insulin and somatostatin concentrations. REK designed and performed Ussing chamber experiments and constructed figures. REK, DBA and JJH interpreted pancreas perfusion data. SMG and TM-P designed and performed qPCR expression and western blot analyses on rat and human islets/kidney and produced and interpreted data. AA and BT carried out the glucose transporter analysis on sorted human alpha, beta and delta cells from population 1. LC performed the qPCR analyses on human kidney. NW provided intellectual content and interpreted data. NJWA did the expression analysis of glucose transporters, population 2. CØ designed, performed and interpreted the immunohistochemistry on mouse, rat and human pancreas and kidney. AEA, FMG and FR did all work related to the expression of SGLT2 and other glucose transporters in mouse pancreatic cells and produced and interpreted data. REK drafted the manuscript. REK, SMG, AEA, DBA, LC, AA, NJWA, CØ, TM-P, FMG, FR, NW, BT and JJH critically revised and edited the manuscript. All authors approved the final version of the manuscript. JJH is the guarantor of this work and, as such, had full access to all the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.FundingREK was supported by a postdoctoral scholarship from the Lundbeck foundation (Lundbeckfonden, R264-2017-3492). LC was supported by a postdoctoral scholarship from the AstraZeneca postdoc programme. The isolated perfused rat pancreas studies, immunohistochemistry, qPCR on human and rat islets and western blotting were supported by a grant from Lundbeck foundation to REK (Lundbeckfonden, R289-2018-1026) an unrestricted grant to JJH from the Novo Nordisk Center for Basic Metabolic Research (Novo Nordisk Foundation, Denmark), a separate grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation (grant no. NNF15OC0016574), a grant to JJH from the European Research Council (grant no. 695069) and the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development, and Demonstration Activities (grant No. 266408). Gene expression analysis on mouse tissue was supported by grants to FR and FMG from Wellcome (106262/Z/14/Z and 106263/Z/14/Z) and the MRC (MRC_MC_UU_12012/3). The study sponsors had no involvement in the conception of study, study design, interpretation of data or writing of the manuscript.Duality of interestAA, LC and BT are employed by AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca had no involvement in the conception of study, design and execution of experiments, interpretation of data or writing of the manuscript. All other authors declare that there is no duality of interest associated with their contribution to this manuscript.Publisher's noteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",https://t.co/CidyUKN2Pv,news

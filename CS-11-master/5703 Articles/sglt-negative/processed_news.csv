"Diabetes drugs linked to 'flesh-eating' genital infection, study finds","Some newer diabetes drugs have been linked to a nightmarish ""flesh-eating"" genital disease that can spread rapidly and kill skin tissue as it grows, according to a new study by US Food and Drug Administration scientists. Symptoms of the disease known as 'Fournier gangrene' include pain, redness and a foul odor in the genital area. Alarmingly, the infection starts by attacking your genital or anal region, but can also spread rapidly and kill other body tissue along the way.

In comparison, researchers found only 19 cases of the disease in patients taking other diabetes medications from 1984 to 2019.As disturbing as the possible side effects may be, diabetes experts are keen to stress that the infections affect a very small percentage of diabetics. ""The benefits of these medications outweigh the risks,"" Dr Joel Zonszein, director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, told Medical Xpress.

Um olhar mais atento no Glucagon,"""Ao contrário da crença popular, a insulina não é necessária para a captação e utilização de glicose no homem"". (Manninen, 2004)Em um mundo onde aprendemos que a principal função da insulina é facilitar a captação celular de glicose, a afirmação acima é nada menos que revolucionária. De fato, porém, como o autor continua a dizer:""Ao contrário da crença popular apoiada pelos principais livros didáticos de fisiologia e bioquímica, há população suficiente de transportadores de glicose em todas as membranas celulares em todos os momentos para garantir a captação de glicose suficiente para satisfazer a respiração da célula, mesmo na ausência de insulina. A insulina pode e aumenta o número desses transportadores em algumas células, mas a absorção de glicose nunca é verdadeiramente dependente de insulina"".Isso pode chocar muitas pessoas, especialmente aquelas que vivem com diabetes tipo 1 ou tipo 2. Mas é verdade: a maioria dos transportadores de glicose não precisa de insulina para levar glicose às células. GLUT4, o mais abundante transportador de glicose no tecido adiposo, músculos esqueléticos e cardíacos, é sensível à insulina e sua translocação para a membrana celular é estimulada pela insulina, mas também pode participar da captação de glicose não mediada por insulina, como durante atividade física. (De fato, o exercício é o estímulo mais potente para aumentar a expressão de GLUT4 no músculo esquelético.) Então, por que a maioria das pessoas - incluindo muitos médicos e nutricionistas - pensa na insulina principalmente como um ""hormônio do açúcar no sangue""?Não há dúvida de que a insulina desempenha um papel primordial na regulação da glicemia, mas não pela razão que geralmente pensamos. Como mencionado, a captação de glicose no corpo nunca é verdadeiramente dependente da insulina. O papel principal da insulina na gluco-regulação pode ser neutralizar os efeitos do glucagon. E com cerca de 88% das pessoas pesquisadas no ano passado preenchendo os critérios de ""metabolicamente pouco saudável"" e a maior parte disso advém de síndrome metabólica ou insulina cronicamente alta, há uma boa razão para que a insulina e a resistência à insulina consigam a maior parte das manchetes de saúde. Mas e quanto ao glucagon, um hormônio contra-regulador da insulina?O glucagon é secretado pelas células alfa do pâncreas e tem efeitos opostos aos da insulina: enquanto a insulina inibe a lipólise e a cetogênese (a degradação das gorduras e a geração de cetonas, respectivamente), o glucagon estimula essas células. A insulina é anticatabólica; o glucagon é catabólico. Podemos ver isso no modo como os indivíduos com diabetes tipo 1 não tratado (DM1) definham: esse é o efeito da ação do glucagon quando a insulina está ausente ou insuficiente para mantê-lo sob controle. Como o Dr. Roger Unger, um especialista neste campo, escreveu: ""as ações catabólicas até então consideradas as consequências diretas da falta de insulina são mediadas por um excesso relativo ou absoluto de glucagon à insulina"".Enquanto a insulina reduz a glicose no sangue (GS) no estado pós-prandial ou alimentado, o glucagon aumenta a GS no estado de jejum, quer isso signifique durante um longo período de jejum ou simplesmente durante a noite ou por longos períodos entre refeições quando o alimento não foi consumido por várias horas. Isso é feito estimulando a glicogenólise e a gliconeogênese no fígado. Também pode catabolizar proteínas musculares para gerar glicose a partir de aminoácidos, o que explica o desperdício observado em DM1 não tratado.A hiperglicemia - particularmente no caso da DM1, mas também possivelmente em indivíduos com resistência à insulina - não resulta necessariamente da incapacidade das células de absorver glicose, mas da produção hepática descontrolada e da liberação de glicose: ""O uso de infusões de glicose traçadora demonstrou não só que a hiperglicemia em face da deficiência de insulina é o resultado da produção excessiva de glicose pelo fígado, mas também que a infusão de insulina reduz a glicemia ao inibir a produção hepática de glicose.""Um artigo publicado após o citado acima corrobora:""Quando a insulina é administrada a pessoas com diabetes em jejum, as concentrações de glicose no sangue diminuem. É geralmente assumido que isso ocorre porque a insulina aumenta a captação de glicose nos tecidos. No entanto, este não é o caso e é apenas mais uma lenda metabólica decorrente de dados de ratos in vitro. Tem sido demonstrado que a insulina em concentrações que estão dentro da faixa fisiológica normal reduz a glicose no sangue através da inibição da produção de glicose hepática."" (Manninen, 2004)A hiperglicemia, ou até mesmo um aumento normal na glicose como ocorre após uma refeição, normalmente provoca um aumento na insulina, a fim de reduzir a GS, e a presença de insulina suprime a secreção de glucagon. Quando a insulina está ausente, no entanto, como no DM1, ou quando as células alfa pancreáticas não respondem adequadamente à insulina (como pode ocorrer na DM2), a elevação da GS estimula a secreção de glucagon: ""Isso adiciona uma fonte endógena de glicose à glicose exógena da refeição.""Não é de se estranhar que a GS seja tão alta quando usada em DM1 ou DM2 - até mais do que seria esperado apenas do conteúdo de carboidrato de uma refeição.Além do controle da GS, estimulando a lipólise e cetogênese, e inibindo a síntese de ácidos graxos, o glucagon atravessa a barreira hematoencefálica e parece regular o apetite e a saciedade através de efeitos no sistema nervoso central. (Evidências indicam que uma pequena quantidade de síntese de glucagon ocorre também dentro do tronco cerebral, e algumas também são produzidas nas células L eneteroendócrinas da mucosa intestinal.) Também foi demonstrado que aumenta a taxa metabólica através da ativação do tecido adiposo marrom e induzindo um efeito termogênico. Por estas razões, a ação do glucagon é um alvo atraente para drogas e outras terapias destinadas à perda de gordura. Algumas sobreposições entre a ação do glucagon e do GLP-1 podem explicar a modesta perda de peso observada em pessoas com ou sem DM2 tratadas com drogas agonistas do receptor de GLP-1.Indivíduos em dieta lowcarb ou cetogênica às vezes temem os efeitos do aumento de glicose do glucagon. No entanto, a gliconeogênese (GNG) no contexto de uma dieta baixa em carboidratos ou cetogênica é diferente daquela que ocorre em uma dieta rica em carboidratos ou, mais especificamente, quando o glicogênio hepático está cheio: ""A propriedade hiperglicêmica do glucagon é reforçada quando os níveis de glicogênio hepático são altos e diminuídos quando os níveis de glicogênio são baixos, como em animais em jejum, animais diabéticos em cetose ou pacientes com cirrose hepática.""Evidentemente, não é preciso jejuar, nem ter diabetes ou cirrose para que o glicogênio hepático seja baixo. Isso ocorre naturalmente em dietas baixas em carboidratos ou cetogênicas, e como o corpo e o cérebro sempre precisam de glicose, mesmo com uma dieta cetogênica estrita, os keto dieters podem agradecer ao glucagon por mantê-los vivos e ajudar seu cérebro a funcionar. No contexto de uma dieta lowcarb ou keto, a GNG normalmente não causa hiperglicemia; apenas mantém a GS dentro de uma faixa saudável, impedindo que caia a níveis perigosamente baixos. As pessoas que seguem dietas de baixo carboidrato para perda de gordura ou controle da glicose no sangue não precisam temer a GNG induzido pelo glucagon, causando uma GS cronicamente elevada e as sequelas metabólicas indesejáveis ​​que resultariam. O contexto da glicose aparecendo no sangue é totalmente diferente de uma dieta rica em carboidratos com glicogênio hepático totalmente repleto. (Ben Bikman, PhD, um pesquisador focado em insulina e bem conhecido na comunidade cetogênica, deu uma palestra informativa sobre o assunto em 2018: Insulina vs. Glucagon: A relevância da proteína na dieta.)O glucagon é um hormônio fascinante, com influências poderosas em várias áreas de interesse, incluindo diabetes tipo 1 e 2, perda de gordura, regulação do apetite e muito mais.

ORMP: Data from Phase 1 Trial of Oral GLP-1 in 2Q19…,"By David Bautz, PhDNASDAQ:ORMPREAD THE FULL ORMP RESEARCH REPORTBusiness UpdateOramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP) is a biotechnology company with a proprietary oral protein delivery platform technology. The lead development candidate is ORMD-0801, an oral insulin, that is currently being tested in both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetics (T2D). The company is also developing ORMD-0901, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).ORMD-0801 UpdateType 1 Diabetics: In June 2018, the company initiated both a clamp study and a food effect study, and while these studies are enrolling T1D patients and healthy controls, investors should be aware that the data gleaned from these studies will be equally applicable to an approval in T2D. The clamp study is enrolling T1D patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 10% between the ages of 18-50. The clamp study was originally developed in 1979 as a means of testing how well a patient metabolizes glucose and their insulin sensitivity (DeFronzo et al., 1979). A clamp study is a requirement of all regulatory agencies around the world for performing pharmacodynamic studies of diabetes drugs in development. We anticipate results from this study in the first half of 2019. The food effect study is a single blind, five period, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study that is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 as a function of when the drug is administered in relation to meals. Up to 48 subjects (half healthy volunteers and half T1D patients) will be enrolled. We anticipate data from this study in mid-2019. Type 2 Diabetics: In April 2018, Oramed initiated a 90-day dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial designed to measure the effect of ORMD-0801 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is a prerequisite prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials. Recently, Oramed announced that the trial is over 75% enrolled. The company had previously found a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c following just 28 days of treatment in the company's prior Phase 2 clinical trial. High levels of blood glucose results in its binding to hemoglobin (becoming glycated). Since red blood cells survive for an average of 90 days, it typically takes this amount of time to determine the true effect a drug may be having on reducing glycated hemoglobin. We anticipate approximately 285 patients being enrolled in the trial, which will test 16, 24, and 32 mg doses of ORMD-0801 given once, twice, or three times a day. Topline results should be available before the end of 2019. NASH Study: On Oct. 4, 2018, Oramed announced the initiation of an exploratory proof-of-concept study to evaluate ORMD-0801 in patients suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will test the ability of ORMD-0801 to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH patients. NASH is inflammation and damage to the liver brought about by a buildup of fat and is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is often a ""silent"" liver disease as most patients with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. However, NASH can be severe and ultimately lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently estimated to affect two to five percent of the U.S. population (NIDDK) with the global market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2025 (Allied Market Research).License Deal in China: In 2015, Oramed signed a Technology License Agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubation of Technologies Co. Ltd. (HTIT), a Chinese company that owns a GMP-certified API insulin manufacturing facility. The agreement gave HTIT exclusive commercialization rights for ORMD-0801 in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. HTIT purchased $12 million in restricted stock and will pay 10% royalties on net sales along with up to $37.5 million in milestone payments. Oramed has already received $33 million. China represents a vast potential opportunity as there are over 100 million diabetic individuals in the country and approximately 500 million that are pre-diabetic.On Mar. 26, 2019, Oramed announced that HTIT had an IND application approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration, which will allow for the start of clinical trials for ORMD-0801 in China. ORMD-0901 UpdateOn September 17, 2018, Oramed announced that the U.S. FDA has approved the company's investigational new drug application (IND) to initiate clinical trials for ORMD-0901, an oral formulation of the GLP-1 analog exenatide. GLP-1 analogs mimic the action of GLP-1 and are currently used in the treatment of T2D, with sales of this class of drugs totaling $6.9 billion in 2017 (EvaluatePharma). On Jan. 22, 2019, the company announced that it initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ORMD-0901. It is a randomized, single blind, placebo controlled crossover study which will evaluate the safety of ORMD-0901 as well as its PK compared to placebo and open label Byetta® in up to 15 healthy subjects. We anticipate results from this trial the second quarter of 2019. Intellectual Property UpdateOn Mar. 28, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Protease Inhibitor-Containing Compositions, Compositions Comprising Same, and Methods for Producing and using Same"", which protects the protease inhibitors associated with the company's oral insulin technology. On Apr. 4, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Methods and Compositions for Oral Administration of Exenatide"", which provides IP protection for ORMD-0901, for which the company has recently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. Financial UpdateOn April 10, 2019, Oramed filed form 10-Q with financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 that ended February 28, 2019. The company reported revenues of $0.67 million, which are related to the license agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubator of Technologies Co., Ltd. (HTIT) singed in 2015. The revenues originating from that license agreement are recognized through June 2023. Cost of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $0.06 million, compared to $0.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was due to additional milestone payments received during the three months ending Feb. 28, 2019.R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $3.1 million, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the Phase 2b and GLP-1 pharmacokinetics clinical trials. G&amp;A expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.1 million, compared to $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. As of Feb. 28, 2019, Oramed had approximately $40.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term deposits and marketable securities. We estimate that the company has sufficient capital to fund operations for at least the next 18 months. As of Apr. 9, 2019, the company had approximately 17.4 million common shares outstanding and when factoring in stock options and warrants a fully diluted share count of approximately 21.6 million. ValuationWe value Oramed using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential future revenues from ORMD-0801 and ORMD-0901. We currently model for approval of ORMD-0801 in 2024 with first sales in 2025 and approval of ORMD-0901 in 2025 with first sales in 2026. We estimate for peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0801 of approximately $400 million and peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0901 of approximately $500 million. Using a 12% discount rate and a 60% probability of approval for ORMD-0801 and a 45% probability of approval for ORMD-0901 leads to a net present value for those two programs of $181 million and $152 million, respectively. When including the current cash total, potential cash from warrant exercises, and dividing by the fully diluted share count leads to a net present value for Oramed of approximately $18 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

"HbA1c, insulin use predict real-world response to GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes","A patient's response to GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in type 2 diabetes depends on several pretreatment characteristics, including baseline HbA1c, diabetes duration, age and use of insulin therapy, according to a real-world analysis published in Current Medical Research and Opinion.Didac Mauricio""In a real-world cohort of obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, the addition of GLP-1 receptor agonists was effective in reducing weight and glycemia after 6 to 12 months to a degree similarly seen in clinical trials,"" Didac Mauricio, MD, PhD, director of the department of endocrinology and nutrition at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain, told Endocrine Today. ""However, the probability of achieving a clinically meaningful glycemic response (reduction 1% in HbA1c) varied depending on the patient's pretreatment characteristics. In the study, patients were frequently treated with insulin (40%), and the median diabetes duration was 7 years, suggesting that GLP-1 receptor agonists were initiated in patients with advanced disease vs. patients in early stages, when the latter is associated with better glycemic response.""In a retrospective study, Mauricio and colleagues analyzed data from 4,242 patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy between 2007 and 2014 in primary health care centers in Catalonia, Spain (47.9% men; mean age, 59 years; median diabetes duration, 7.3 years; mean HbA1c, 8.82%; mean BMI, 37.5 kg/m²). Researchers evaluated changes in HbA1c and body weight at 6 to 12 months, as well as factors independently associated with achieving a reduction of at least 1% in HbA1c.Researchers found that mean HbA1c for the cohort fell from 8.8% to 7.7% at 6 to 12 months after initiating therapy, with 47.2% of patients experiencing an HbA1c reduction of at least 1%. Patients lost a mean of 3.6 kg, with 60% of patients experiencing a reduction in both body weight and HbA1c. Women experienced greater weight loss vs. men (mean, –4.1 vs. –3.1; P = .007), according to researchers.Independent determinants of a 1% HbA1c reduction were baseline HbA1c, age, diabetes duration and background insulin therapy, according to researchers.In results stratified by GLP-1 receptor agonist type, researchers found that the reduction in weight or HbA1c and the proportion of patients achieving a HbA1c reduction of at least 1% was larger among adults prescribed liraglutide (Victoza, Novo Nordisk) vs. exenatide (Byetta/Bydureon, AstraZeneca) and lixisenatide (Adlyxin, Sanofi).""The results showed that this class of antidiabetic drugs works in different groups of patients with type 2 diabetes, but the response varied depending on the characteristics of the patient and the prescribed drug,"" Mauricio said. ""Identifying and prospectively differentiating profiles of subjects that predict the odds of response to GLP-1 receptor agonists should help physicians when making medication choices in complex patients.

A patient's response to GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in type 2 diabetes depends on several pretreatment characteristics, including baseline HbA1c, diabetes duration, age and use of insulin therapy, according to a real-world analysis published in Current Medical Research and Opinion.Didac Mauricio""In a real-world cohort of obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, the addition of GLP-1 receptor agonists was effective in reducing weight and glycemia after 6 to 12 months to a degree similarly seen in clinical trials,"" Didac Mauricio, MD, PhD, director of the department of endocrinology and nutrition at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain, told Endocrine Today. ""However, the probability of achieving a clinically meaningful glycemic response (reduction 1% in HbA1c) varied depending on the patient's pretreatment characteristics. In the study, patients were frequently treated with insulin (40%), and the median diabetes duration was 7 years, suggesting that GLP-1 receptor agonists were initiated in patients with advanced disease vs. patients in early stages, when the latter is associated with better glycemic response.""In a retrospective study, Mauricio and colleagues analyzed data from 4,242 patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy between 2007 and 2014 in primary health care centers in Catalonia, Spain (47.9% men; mean age, 59 years; median diabetes duration, 7.3 years; mean HbA1c, 8.82%; mean BMI, 37.5 kg/m²). Researchers evaluated changes in HbA1c and body weight at 6 to 12 months, as well as factors independently associated with achieving a reduction of at least 1% in HbA1c.Researchers found that mean HbA1c for the cohort fell from 8.8% to 7.7% at 6 to 12 months after initiating therapy, with 47.2% of patients experiencing an HbA1c reduction of at least 1%. Patients lost a mean of 3.6 kg, with 60% of patients experiencing a reduction in both body weight and HbA1c. Women experienced greater weight loss vs. men (mean, –4.1 vs. –3.1; P = .007), according to researchers.Independent determinants of a 1% HbA1c reduction were baseline HbA1c, age, diabetes duration and background insulin therapy, according to researchers.In results stratified by GLP-1 receptor agonist type, researchers found that the reduction in weight or HbA1c and the proportion of patients achieving a HbA1c reduction of at least 1% was larger among adults prescribed liraglutide (Victoza, Novo Nordisk) vs. exenatide (Byetta/Bydureon, AstraZeneca) and lixisenatide (Adlyxin, Sanofi).""The results showed that this class of antidiabetic drugs works in different groups of patients with type 2 diabetes, but the response varied depending on the characteristics of the patient and the prescribed drug,"" Mauricio said. ""Identifying and prospectively differentiating profiles of subjects that predict the odds of response to GLP-1 receptor agonists should help physicians when making medication choices in complex patients. For example, long diabetes duration and prior insulin therapy seemed to decrease the probabilities of achieving an HbA1c reduction of at least 1% in our study. Conversely, a high pretreatment HbA1c value, older age or use of liraglutide were predictors of meaningful glycemic response.""PAGE BREAKMauricio said the findings speak to a need to conduct large observational studies in real-world settings to characterize the clinical interindividual differences in therapeutic response to antidiabetic drugs.""Variables such as medication adherence or the effect of adverse events on treatment discontinuation need to be specifically studied to assess how they impact the clinical results,"" Mauricio said. – by Regina Schaffer For more information: Didac Mauricio, MD, PhD, can be reached at the Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Sant Quinti, 89, 08041, Barcelona, Spain; email: didacmauricio@gmail.com.

Amelioration of muscle wasting by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in muscle atrophy.,"AbstractBACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle atrophy is defined as a reduction of muscle mass caused by excessive protein degradation. However, the development of therapeutic interventions is still in an early stage. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, such as exendin-4 (Ex-4) and dulaglutide, are widely used for the treatment of diabetes, their effects on muscle pathology are unknown. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of GLP-1R agonist for muscle wasting and the mechanisms involved.METHODS: Mouse C2C12 myotubes were used to evaluate the in vitro effects of Ex-4 in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (Dex) on the regulation of the expression of muscle atrophic factors and the underlying mechanisms using various pharmacological inhibitors. In addition, we investigated the in vivo therapeutic effect of Ex-4 in a Dex-induced mouse muscle atrophy model (20 mg/kg/day i.p.) followed by injection of Ex-4 (100 ng/day i.p.) for 12 days and chronic kidney disease (CKD)-induced muscle atrophy model. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of a long-acting GLP-1R agonist by treatment of dulaglutide (1 mg/kg/week s.c.) for 3 weeks, in DBA/2J-mdx mice, a Duchenne muscular dystrophy model.RESULTS: Ex-4 suppressed the expression of myostatin (MSTN) and muscle atrophic factors such as F-box only protein 32 (atrogin-1) and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) in Dex-treated C2C12 myotubes. The suppression effect was via protein kinase A and protein kinase B signalling pathways through GLP-1R. In addition, Ex-4 treatment inhibited glucocorticoid receptor (GR) translocation by up-regulating the proteins of GR inhibitory complexes. In a Dex-induced muscle atrophy model, Ex-4 ameliorated muscle atrophy by suppressing muscle atrophic factors and enhancing myogenic factors (MyoG and MyoD), leading to increased muscle mass and function. In the CKD muscle atrophy model, Ex-4 also increased muscle mass, myofiber size, and muscle function. In addition, treatment with a long-acting GLP-1R agonist, dulaglutide, recovered muscle mass and function in DBA/2J-mdx mice.CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1R agonists ameliorate muscle wasting by suppressing MSTN and muscle atrophic factors and enhancing myogenic factors through GLP-1R-mediated signalling pathways. These novel findings suggest that activating GLP-1R signalling may be useful for the treatment of atrophy-related muscular diseases.© 2019 The Authors Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders.",https://t.co/oNS63A95yF,news

ORMP: Data from Phase 1 Trial of Oral GLP-1 in 2Q19…,"By David Bautz, PhD NASDAQ:ORMP READ THE FULL ORMP RESEARCH REPORT Business UpdateOramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ORMP) is a biotechnology company with a proprietary oral protein delivery platform technology. The lead development candidate is ORMD-0801, an oral insulin, that is currently being tested in both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetics (T2D). The company is also developing ORMD-0901, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).ORMD-0801 UpdateType 1 Diabetics: In June 2018, the company initiated both a clamp study and a food effect study, and while these studies are enrolling T1D patients and healthy controls, investors should be aware that the data gleaned from these studies will be equally applicable to an approval in T2D. The clamp study is enrolling T1D patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 10% between the ages of 18-50. The clamp study was originally developed in 1979 as a means of testing how well a patient metabolizes glucose and their insulin sensitivity (DeFronzo et al., 1979). A clamp study is a requirement of all regulatory agencies around the world for performing pharmacodynamic studies of diabetes drugs in development. We anticipate results from this study in the first half of 2019. The food effect study is a single blind, five period, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study that is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 as a function of when the drug is administered in relation to meals. Up to 48 subjects (half healthy volunteers and half T1D patients) will be enrolled. We anticipate data from this study in mid-2019. Type 2 Diabetics: In April 2018, Oramed initiated a 90-day dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial designed to measure the effect of ORMD-0801 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is a prerequisite prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials. Recently, Oramed announced that the trial is over 75% enrolled. The company had previously found a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c following just 28 days of treatment in the company's prior Phase 2 clinical trial. High levels of blood glucose results in its binding to hemoglobin (becoming glycated). Since red blood cells survive for an average of 90 days, it typically takes this amount of time to determine the true effect a drug may be having on reducing glycated hemoglobin. We anticipate approximately 285 patients being enrolled in the trial, which will test 16, 24, and 32 mg doses of ORMD-0801 given once, twice, or three times a day. Topline results should be available before the end of 2019. NASH Study: On Oct. 4, 2018, Oramed announced the initiation of an exploratory proof-of-concept study to evaluate ORMD-0801 in patients suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will test the ability of ORMD-0801 to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH patients. NASH is inflammation and damage to the liver brought about by a buildup of fat and is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is often a ""silent"" liver disease as most patients with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. However, NASH can be severe and ultimately lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently estimated to affect two to five percent of the U.S. population (NIDDK) with the global market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2025 (Allied Market Research).License Deal in China: In 2015, Oramed signed a Technology License Agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubation of Technologies Co. Ltd. (HTIT), a Chinese company that owns a GMP-certified API insulin manufacturing facility. The agreement gave HTIT exclusive commercialization rights for ORMD-0801 in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. HTIT purchased $12 million in restricted stock and will pay 10% royalties on net sales along with up to $37.5 million in milestone payments. Oramed has already received $33 million. China represents a vast potential opportunity as there are over 100 million diabetic individuals in the country and approximately 500 million that are pre-diabetic.On Mar. 26, 2019, Oramed announced that HTIT had an IND application approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration, which will allow for the start of clinical trials for ORMD-0801 in China.Story continuesORMD-0901 UpdateOn September 17, 2018, Oramed announced that the U.S. FDA has approved the company's investigational new drug application (IND) to initiate clinical trials for ORMD-0901, an oral formulation of the GLP-1 analog exenatide. GLP-1 analogs mimic the action of GLP-1 and are currently used in the treatment of T2D, with sales of this class of drugs totaling $6.9 billion in 2017 (EvaluatePharma). On Jan. 22, 2019, the company announced that it initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ORMD-0901. It is a randomized, single blind, placebo controlled crossover study which will evaluate the safety of ORMD-0901 as well as its PK compared to placebo and open label Byetta® in up to 15 healthy subjects. We anticipate results from this trial the second quarter of 2019. Intellectual Property UpdateOn Mar. 28, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Protease Inhibitor-Containing Compositions, Compositions Comprising Same, and Methods for Producing and using Same"", which protects the protease inhibitors associated with the company's oral insulin technology. On Apr. 4, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Methods and Compositions for Oral Administration of Exenatide"", which provides IP protection for ORMD-0901, for which the company has recently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. Financial UpdateOn April 10, 2019, Oramed filed form 10-Q with financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 that ended February 28, 2019. The company reported revenues of $0.67 million, which are related to the license agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubator of Technologies Co., Ltd. (HTIT) singed in 2015. The revenues originating from that license agreement are recognized through June 2023. Cost of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $0.06 million, compared to $0.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was due to additional milestone payments received during the three months ending Feb. 28, 2019.R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $3.1 million, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the Phase 2b and GLP-1 pharmacokinetics clinical trials. G&amp;A expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.1 million, compared to $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. As of Feb. 28, 2019, Oramed had approximately $40.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term deposits and marketable securities. We estimate that the company has sufficient capital to fund operations for at least the next 18 months. As of Apr. 9, 2019, the company had approximately 17.4 million common shares outstanding and when factoring in stock options and warrants a fully diluted share count of approximately 21.6 million. ValuationWe value Oramed using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential future revenues from ORMD-0801 and ORMD-0901. We currently model for approval of ORMD-0801 in 2024 with first sales in 2025 and approval of ORMD-0901 in 2025 with first sales in 2026. We estimate for peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0801 of approximately $400 million and peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0901 of approximately $500 million. Using a 12% discount rate and a 60% probability of approval for ORMD-0801 and a 45% probability of approval for ORMD-0901 leads to a net present value for those two programs of $181 million and $152 million, respectively. When including the current cash total, potential cash from warrant exercises, and dividing by the fully diluted share count leads to a net present value for Oramed of approximately $18 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

"Llega a España Ozempic, para el tratamiento de diabetes tipo 2 con alto riesgo cardiovascular","La compañía farmacéutica Novo Nordisk ha presentado su nuevo fármaco Ozempic (semaglutida) dirigido a pacientes con diabetes tipo 2 con beneficio sobre la glucemia, el peso y el riesgo cardiovascular. Una de las grandes ventajas de este fármaco es la comodidad de su posología, ya que requiere de una única administración semanal por vía subcutánea. La semaglutida es un nuevo análogo péptido similar al glucagón tipo 1 (GLP-1), que ha demostrado una gran reducción del nivel de glucosa en sangre, y simultáneamente ayuda controlar el peso y reducir el riesgo de sufrir un episodio cardiovascular grave (como infartos de miocardio o ictus) en un 26 por ciento. Los buenos resultados de Ozempic se desprenden del programa de ensayos clínicos Sustain, con más de 8.000 participantes, que demostraron un alto nivel de seguridad y tolerabilidad. A la presentación del fármaco ha acudido Mads W. Ø. Larsen, director general de Novo Nordisk en España, quien ha considerado que la llegada de este fármaco a España es una muestra del compromiso continúo que tiene Novo Nordisk con la innovación, sobre todo, teniendo en cuenta el elevado número de pacientes que padecen esta enfermedad, y que sigue creciendo día a día. Según el doctor Esteban Jódar, jefe del Departamento de Endocrinología y Nutrición de los Hospitales Quirón Salud Pozuelo, Ruber Juan Bravo y San José (Madrid), una de las grandes ventajas del fármaco es que, además de aumentar los años de vida, aumenta la calidad de vida en esos años. Esto, afirma Jódar, se debe a que cuenta con un perfil muy positivo desde el punto de vista técnico, sumado a que hasta el momento no habían conseguido dar con un fármaco tan potente cuya posología fuera tan cómoda. Por su parte, Lluís Masmiquel, jefe de edocrinología del Hospital Universitario Son Llátzer, en Palma de Mallorca, ha resaltado que Ozempic ha demostrado en ensayos clínicos una alta reducción de ictus, infartos y otros eventos cardiovasculares; también ha explicado que el fármaco es especialmente útil en casos de obesidad, patología que afecta aproximadamente al 80 por ciento de pacientes con diabetes, ya que la semaglutida contribuye a la bajada de peso.

(NASDAQ:ORMP) is a biotechnology company with a proprietary oral protein delivery platform technology. The lead development candidate is ORMD-0801, an oral insulin, that is currently being tested in both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetics (T2D). The company is also developing ORMD-0901, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).ORMD-0801 UpdateType 1 Diabetics: In June 2018, the company initiated both a clamp study and a food effect study, and while these studies are enrolling T1D patients and healthy controls, investors should be aware that the data gleaned from these studies will be equally applicable to an approval in T2D. The clamp study is enrolling T1D patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 10% between the ages of 18-50. The clamp study was originally developed in 1979 as a means of testing how well a patient metabolizes glucose and their insulin sensitivity (DeFronzo et al., 1979). A clamp study is a requirement of all regulatory agencies around the world for performing pharmacodynamic studies of diabetes drugs in development. We anticipate results from this study in the first half of 2019. The food effect study is a single blind, five period, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study that is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 as a function of when the drug is administered in relation to meals. Up to 48 subjects (half healthy volunteers and half T1D patients) will be enrolled. We anticipate data from this study in mid-2019. Type 2 Diabetics: In April 2018, Oramed initiated a 90-day dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial designed to measure the effect of ORMD-0801 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is a prerequisite prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials. Recently, Oramed announced that the trial is over 75% enrolled. The company had previously found a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c following just 28 days of treatment in the company's prior Phase 2 clinical trial. High levels of blood glucose results in its binding to hemoglobin (becoming glycated). Since red blood cells survive for an average of 90 days, it typically takes this amount of time to determine the true effect a drug may be having on reducing glycated hemoglobin. We anticipate approximately 285 patients being enrolled in the trial, which will test 16, 24, and 32 mg doses of ORMD-0801 given once, twice, or three times a day. Topline results should be available before the end of 2019. NASH Study: On Oct. 4, 2018, Oramed announced the initiation of an exploratory proof-of-concept study to evaluate ORMD-0801 in patients suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will test the ability of ORMD-0801 to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH patients. NASH is inflammation and damage to the liver brought about by a buildup of fat and is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is often a ""silent"" liver disease as most patients with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. However, NASH can be severe and ultimately lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently estimated to affect two to five percent of the U.S. population (NIDDK) with the global market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2025 (Allied Market Research).License Deal in China: In 2015, Oramed signed a Technology License Agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubation of Technologies Co. Ltd. (HTIT), a Chinese company that owns a GMP-certified API insulin manufacturing facility. The agreement gave HTIT exclusive commercialization rights for ORMD-0801 in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. HTIT purchased $12 million in restricted stock and will pay 10% royalties on net sales along with up to $37.5 million in milestone payments. Oramed has already received $33 million. China represents a vast potential opportunity as there are over 100 million diabetic individuals in the country and approximately 500 million that are pre-diabetic.On Mar. 26, 2019, Oramed announced that HTIT had an IND application approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration, which will allow for the start of clinical trials for ORMD-0801 in China. ORMD-0901 UpdateOn September 17, 2018, Oramed announced that the U.S. FDA has approved the company's investigational new drug application (IND) to initiate clinical trials for ORMD-0901, an oral formulation of the GLP-1 analog exenatide. GLP-1 analogs mimic the action of GLP-1 and are currently used in the treatment of T2D, with sales of this class of drugs totaling $6.9 billion in 2017 (EvaluatePharma). On Jan. 22, 2019, the company announced that it initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ORMD-0901. It is a randomized, single blind, placebo controlled crossover study which will evaluate the safety of ORMD-0901 as well as its PK compared to placebo and open label Byetta® in up to 15 healthy subjects. We anticipate results from this trial the second quarter of 2019. Intellectual Property UpdateOn Mar. 28, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Protease Inhibitor-Containing Compositions, Compositions Comprising Same, and Methods for Producing and using Same"", which protects the protease inhibitors associated with the company's oral insulin technology. On Apr. 4, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Methods and Compositions for Oral Administration of Exenatide"", which provides IP protection for ORMD-0901, for which the company has recently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. Financial UpdateOn April 10, 2019, Oramed filed form 10-Q with financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 that ended February 28, 2019. The company reported revenues of $0.67 million, which are related to the license agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubator of Technologies Co., Ltd. (HTIT) singed in 2015. The revenues originating from that license agreement are recognized through June 2023. Cost of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $0.06 million, compared to $0.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was due to additional milestone payments received during the three months ending Feb. 28, 2019.R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $3.1 million, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the Phase 2b and GLP-1 pharmacokinetics clinical trials. G&amp;A expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.1 million, compared to $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. As of Feb. 28, 2019, Oramed had approximately $40.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term deposits and marketable securities. We estimate that the company has sufficient capital to fund operations for at least the next 18 months. As of Apr. 9, 2019, the company had approximately 17.4 million common shares outstanding and when factoring in stock options and warrants a fully diluted share count of approximately 21.6 million. ValuationWe value Oramed using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential future revenues from ORMD-0801 and ORMD-0901. We currently model for approval of ORMD-0801 in 2024 with first sales in 2025 and approval of ORMD-0901 in 2025 with first sales in 2026. We estimate for peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0801 of approximately $400 million and peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0901 of approximately $500 million. Using a 12% discount rate and a 60% probability of approval for ORMD-0801 and a 45% probability of approval for ORMD-0901 leads to a net present value for those two programs of $181 million and $152 million, respectively. When including the current cash total, potential cash from warrant exercises, and dividing by the fully diluted share count leads to a net present value for Oramed of approximately $18 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

FDA Delays Decision on Eli Lilly's Nasal Glucagon,"-Shahd HuseinEli Lilly and Company's hopes of bringing nasal glucagon to market may take longer than initially expected.At a recent earnings call on April 30th, Lilly announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has delayed their decision on the company's New Drug Application for a nasal glucagon, an alternative to injectable glucagon. The delay, according to Lilly, could take up to three months.The submission to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) occurred early last year after the completion of two Phase III studies, a jointly funded effort by Eli Lilly and Locemia Solutions, the company that initially developed nasal glucagon. The study was completed just three years after Lilly announced that they had acquired worldwide rights to nasal glucagon from Locemia Solutions.The FDA did not comment for this story on their decision to delay their decision on the novel glucagon treatment.Want more type 1 diabetes-related news stories, and the chance to help type 1 diabetes research? Take a moment to join T1D Exchange Glu now by clicking here.For the most recent study, researchers set out to understand if caregivers could use nasal glucagon to treat moderate to severe lows. Results from the study determined that caregivers of individuals living with diabetes felt comfortable nasally administering the drug, whereas loved ones typically felt discomfort with the current form of glucagon treatment, which includes a multi-step process of mixing and injecting the solution.Glucagon is a powerful, life-saving drug that is used to counter incidences of moderate to severe hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose levels. With Lilly's submission, the company hopes to bring an alternative solution to market, diversifying the ways in which to administer treatment, and giving individuals with diabetes and caregivers an easier option in seemingly stressful situations.Despite delays, Lilly is hopeful. ""We remain confident in nasal glucagon's submission package and look forward to FDA action in the coming months,"" said Dave Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly.We will continue to keep you posted on any decisions on nasal glucagon from the FDA and the EMA.",https://t.co/8jn9txYc9l,news
ORMP: Data from Phase 1 Trial of Oral GLP-1 in 2Q19…,"By David Bautz, PhD NASDAQ:ORMP READ THE FULL ORMP RESEARCH REPORT Business UpdateOramed Pharmaceuticals Inc.

The clamp study was originally developed in 1979 as a means of testing how well a patient metabolizes glucose and their insulin sensitivity (DeFronzo et al., 1979). A clamp study is a requirement of all regulatory agencies around the world for performing pharmacodynamic studies of diabetes drugs in development. We anticipate results from this study in the first half of 2019. The food effect study is a single blind, five period, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study that is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 as a function of when the drug is administered in relation to meals. Up to 48 subjects (half healthy volunteers and half T1D patients) will be enrolled. We anticipate data from this study in mid-2019. Type 2 Diabetics: In April 2018, Oramed initiated a 90-day dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial designed to measure the effect of ORMD-0801 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is a prerequisite prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials. Recently, Oramed announced that the trial is over 75% enrolled. The company had previously found a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c following just 28 days of treatment in the company's prior Phase 2 clinical trial.

Topline results should be available before the end of 2019. NASH Study: On Oct. 4, 2018, Oramed announced the initiation of an exploratory proof-of-concept study to evaluate ORMD-0801 in patients suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will test the ability of ORMD-0801 to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH patients. NASH is inflammation and damage to the liver brought about by a buildup of fat and is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is often a ""silent"" liver disease as most patients with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. However, NASH can be severe and ultimately lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently estimated to affect two to five percent of the U.S. population (NIDDK) with the global market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2025 (Allied Market Research).License Deal in China: In 2015, Oramed signed a Technology License Agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubation of Technologies Co. Ltd. (HTIT), a Chinese company that owns a GMP-certified API insulin manufacturing facility. The agreement gave HTIT exclusive commercialization rights for ORMD-0801 in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. HTIT purchased $12 million in restricted stock and will pay 10% royalties on net sales along with up to $37.5 million in milestone payments. Oramed has already received $33 million. China represents a vast potential opportunity as there are over 100 million diabetic individuals in the country and approximately 500 million that are pre-diabetic.On Mar. 26, 2019, Oramed announced that HTIT had an IND application approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration, which will allow for the start of clinical trials for ORMD-0801 in China.Story continuesORMD-0901 UpdateOn September 17, 2018, Oramed announced that the U.S. FDA has approved the company's investigational new drug application (IND) to initiate clinical trials for ORMD-0901, an oral formulation of the GLP-1 analog exenatide. GLP-1 analogs mimic the action of GLP-1 and are currently used in the treatment of T2D, with sales of this class of drugs totaling $6.9 billion in 2017 (EvaluatePharma). On Jan. 22, 2019, the company announced that it initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ORMD-0901. It is a randomized, single blind, placebo controlled crossover study which will evaluate the safety of ORMD-0901 as well as its PK compared to placebo and open label Byetta® in up to 15 healthy subjects. We anticipate results from this trial the second quarter of 2019. Intellectual Property UpdateOn Mar. 28, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Protease Inhibitor-Containing Compositions, Compositions Comprising Same, and Methods for Producing and using Same"", which protects the protease inhibitors associated with the company's oral insulin technology. On Apr. 4, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Methods and Compositions for Oral Administration of Exenatide"", which provides IP protection for ORMD-0901, for which the company has recently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. Financial UpdateOn April 10, 2019, Oramed filed form 10-Q with financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 that ended February 28, 2019. The company reported revenues of $0.67 million, which are related to the license agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubator of Technologies Co., Ltd. (HTIT) singed in 2015. The revenues originating from that license agreement are recognized through June 2023. Cost of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $0.06 million, compared to $0.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was due to additional milestone payments received during the three months ending Feb. 28, 2019.R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $3.1 million, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the Phase 2b and GLP-1 pharmacokinetics clinical trials. G&amp;A expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.1 million, compared to $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. As of Feb. 28, 2019, Oramed had approximately $40.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term deposits and marketable securities. We estimate that the company has sufficient capital to fund operations for at least the next 18 months. As of Apr. 9, 2019, the company had approximately 17.4 million common shares outstanding and when factoring in stock options and warrants a fully diluted share count of approximately 21.6 million. ValuationWe value Oramed using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential future revenues from ORMD-0801 and ORMD-0901. We currently model for approval of ORMD-0801 in 2024 with first sales in 2025 and approval of ORMD-0901 in 2025 with first sales in 2026. We estimate for peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0801 of approximately $400 million and peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0901 of approximately $500 million. Using a 12% discount rate and a 60% probability of approval for ORMD-0801 and a 45% probability of approval for ORMD-0901 leads to a net present value for those two programs of $181 million and $152 million, respectively. When including the current cash total, potential cash from warrant exercises, and dividing by the fully diluted share count leads to a net present value for Oramed of approximately $18 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

"HbA1c, insulin use predict real-world response to GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes","A patient's response to GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in type 2 diabetes depends on several pretreatment characteristics, including baseline HbA1c, diabetes duration, age and use of insulin therapy, according to a real-world analysis published in Current Medical Research and Opinion.Didac Mauricio""In a real-world cohort of obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, the addition of GLP-1 receptor agonists was effective in reducing weight and glycemia after 6 to 12 months to a degree similarly seen in clinical trials,"" Didac Mauricio, MD, PhD, director of the department of endocrinology and nutrition at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain, told Endocrine Today. ""However, the probability of achieving a clinically meaningful glycemic response (reduction 1% in HbA1c) varied depending on the patient's pretreatment characteristics. In the study, patients were frequently treated with insulin (40%), and the median diabetes duration was 7 years, suggesting that GLP-1 receptor agonists were initiated in patients with advanced disease vs. patients in early stages, when the latter is associated with better glycemic response.""In a retrospective study, Mauricio and colleagues analyzed data from 4,242 patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy between 2007 and 2014 in primary health care centers in Catalonia, Spain (47.9% men; mean age, 59 years; median diabetes duration, 7.3 years; mean HbA1c, 8.82%; mean BMI, 37.5 kg/m²). Researchers evaluated changes in HbA1c and body weight at 6 to 12 months, as well as factors independently associated with achieving a reduction of at least 1% in HbA1c.Researchers found that mean HbA1c for the cohort fell from 8.8% to 7.7% at 6 to 12 months after initiating therapy, with 47.2% of patients experiencing an HbA1c reduction of at least 1%. Patients lost a mean of 3.6 kg, with 60% of patients experiencing a reduction in both body weight and HbA1c. Women experienced greater weight loss vs. men (mean, –4.1 vs. –3.1; P = .007), according to researchers.Independent determinants of a 1% HbA1c reduction were baseline HbA1c, age, diabetes duration and background insulin therapy, according to researchers.In results stratified by GLP-1 receptor agonist type, researchers found that the reduction in weight or HbA1c and the proportion of patients achieving a HbA1c reduction of at least 1% was larger among adults prescribed liraglutide (Victoza, Novo Nordisk) vs. exenatide (Byetta/Bydureon, AstraZeneca) and lixisenatide (Adlyxin, Sanofi).""The results showed that this class of antidiabetic drugs works in different groups of patients with type 2 diabetes, but the response varied depending on the characteristics of the patient and the prescribed drug,"" Mauricio said. ""Identifying and prospectively differentiating profiles of subjects that predict the odds of response to GLP-1 receptor agonists should help physicians when making medication choices in complex patients. For example, long diabetes duration and prior insulin therapy seemed to decrease the probabilities of achieving an HbA1c reduction of at least 1% in our study. Conversely, a high pretreatment HbA1c value, older age or use of liraglutide were predictors of meaningful glycemic response."" Mauricio said the findings speak to a need to conduct large observational studies in real-world settings to characterize the clinical interindividual differences in therapeutic response to antidiabetic drugs.""Variables such as medication adherence or the effect of adverse events on treatment discontinuation need to be specifically studied to assess how they impact the clinical results,"" Mauricio said. – by Regina Schaffer For more information: Didac Mauricio, MD, PhD, can be reached at the Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Sant Quinti, 89, 08041, Barcelona, Spain; email: didacmauricio@gmail.com.

ORMP: Data from Phase 1 Trial of Oral GLP-1 in 2Q19…,"By David Bautz, PhDNASDAQ:ORMPREAD THE FULL ORMP RESEARCH REPORTBusiness UpdateOramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP) is a biotechnology company with a proprietary oral protein delivery platform technology. The lead development candidate is ORMD-0801, an oral insulin, that is currently being tested in both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetics (T2D). The company is also developing ORMD-0901, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).ORMD-0801 UpdateType 1 Diabetics: In June 2018, the company initiated both a clamp study and a food effect study, and while these studies are enrolling T1D patients and healthy controls, investors should be aware that the data gleaned from these studies will be equally applicable to an approval in T2D. The clamp study is enrolling T1D patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 10% between the ages of 18-50. The clamp study was originally developed in 1979 as a means of testing how well a patient metabolizes glucose and their insulin sensitivity (DeFronzo et al., 1979). A clamp study is a requirement of all regulatory agencies around the world for performing pharmacodynamic studies of diabetes drugs in development. We anticipate results from this study in the first half of 2019. The food effect study is a single blind, five period, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study that is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 as a function of when the drug is administered in relation to meals. Up to 48 subjects (half healthy volunteers and half T1D patients) will be enrolled. We anticipate data from this study in mid-2019. Type 2 Diabetics: In April 2018, Oramed initiated a 90-day dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial designed to measure the effect of ORMD-0801 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is a prerequisite prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials. Recently, Oramed announced that the trial is over 75% enrolled. The company had previously found a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c following just 28 days of treatment in the company's prior Phase 2 clinical trial. High levels of blood glucose results in its binding to hemoglobin (becoming glycated). Since red blood cells survive for an average of 90 days, it typically takes this amount of time to determine the true effect a drug may be having on reducing glycated hemoglobin. We anticipate approximately 285 patients being enrolled in the trial, which will test 16, 24, and 32 mg doses of ORMD-0801 given once, twice, or three times a day. Topline results should be available before the end of 2019. NASH Study: On Oct. 4, 2018, Oramed announced the initiation of an exploratory proof-of-concept study to evaluate ORMD-0801 in patients suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will test the ability of ORMD-0801 to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH patients. NASH is inflammation and damage to the liver brought about by a buildup of fat and is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is often a ""silent"" liver disease as most patients with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. However, NASH can be severe and ultimately lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently estimated to affect two to five percent of the U.S. population (NIDDK) with the global market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2025 (Allied Market Research).License Deal in China: In 2015, Oramed signed a Technology License Agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubation of Technologies Co. Ltd. (HTIT), a Chinese company that owns a GMP-certified API insulin manufacturing facility. The agreement gave HTIT exclusive commercialization rights for ORMD-0801 in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. HTIT purchased $12 million in restricted stock and will pay 10% royalties on net sales along with up to $37.5 million in milestone payments. Oramed has already received $33 million. China represents a vast potential opportunity as there are over 100 million diabetic individuals in the country and approximately 500 million that are pre-diabetic.On Mar. 26, 2019, Oramed announced that HTIT had an IND application approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration, which will allow for the start of clinical trials for ORMD-0801 in China. ORMD-0901 UpdateOn September 17, 2018, Oramed announced that the U.S. FDA has approved the company's investigational new drug application (IND) to initiate clinical trials for ORMD-0901, an oral formulation of the GLP-1 analog exenatide. GLP-1 analogs mimic the action of GLP-1 and are currently used in the treatment of T2D, with sales of this class of drugs totaling $6.9 billion in 2017 (EvaluatePharma). On Jan. 22, 2019, the company announced that it initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ORMD-0901. It is a randomized, single blind, placebo controlled crossover study which will evaluate the safety of ORMD-0901 as well as its PK compared to placebo and open label Byetta® in up to 15 healthy subjects. We anticipate results from this trial the second quarter of 2019. Intellectual Property UpdateOn Mar. 28, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Protease Inhibitor-Containing Compositions, Compositions Comprising Same, and Methods for Producing and using Same"", which protects the protease inhibitors associated with the company's oral insulin technology. On Apr. 4, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Methods and Compositions for Oral Administration of Exenatide"", which provides IP protection for ORMD-0901, for which the company has recently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. Financial UpdateOn April 10, 2019, Oramed filed form 10-Q with financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 that ended February 28, 2019.

As of Apr. 9, 2019, the company had approximately 17.4 million common shares outstanding and when factoring in stock options and warrants a fully diluted share count of approximately 21.6 million. ValuationWe value Oramed using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential future revenues from ORMD-0801 and ORMD-0901. We currently model for approval of ORMD-0801 in 2024 with first sales in 2025 and approval of ORMD-0901 in 2025 with first sales in 2026. We estimate for peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0801 of approximately $400 million and peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0901 of approximately $500 million. Using a 12% discount rate and a 60% probability of approval for ORMD-0801 and a 45% probability of approval for ORMD-0901 leads to a net present value for those two programs of $181 million and $152 million, respectively. When including the current cash total, potential cash from warrant exercises, and dividing by the fully diluted share count leads to a net present value for Oramed of approximately $18 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

심혈관질환 동반 당뇨병엔 SGLT-2 iㆍGLP-1 RA,"당뇨병치료제의 CVOT(Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial, 심혈관계 영향 연구) 데이터들이 국내 가이드라인에 대거 반영됐다.이에 따라 심혈관 질환에 이점이 확인된 일부 SGLT-2 억제제와 GLP-1 유사체들이 주목을 받을 것으로 보인다.앞으로 CVOT 데이터가 추가적으로 발표되면 가이드라인을 업데이트 할 수도 있다는 것이 학회 측의 입장이다. 다만, 한국인을 대상으로 한 임상데이터가 부족한 것은 아쉽다는 평가다.◇죽상경화성 심혈관질환 동반 당뇨병 환자, '심혈관 질환 예방효과 입증된 약제' 권고11일 경주화백센터에서 진행된 대한당뇨병학회 춘계학술대회에서는 예정대로 '2019 당뇨병 진료지침(제6판)'이 공개됐다.특히 이번 진료지침은 약물요법 부분에서 주목할만한 변화가 있었다. CVOT 데이터가 축적되면서 죽상동맥경화성 심혈관질환 동반 당뇨병 환자에 대한 진료지침이 추가된 것.경구제에서는 SGLT-2 억제제가, 주사제에서는 GLP-1 유사체가 권고됐는데, 그 중에서도 심혈관질환 예방효과가 '입증된 약제'를 선택하라는 것이 진료지침이다.주석에서는 해당 약제로 SGLT-2 억제제 가운데 엠파글리플로진(자디앙, 베링거인겔하임ㆍ릴리)과 다파글리플로진(포시가, 아스트라제네카), GLP-1 유사체에서는 리라글루타이드(빅토자)와 세마글루타이드(오젬픽, 이상 노보노디스크)를 꼽았다.구체적으로 진료지침은 심혈관질환 위험인자를 동반한 경우 엠파글리플로진이 심혈관사망, 모든 원인에 의한 사망과 심부전으로 인한 입원 감소 효과를, 다파글리플로진은 심부전으로 인한 입원 감소 효과를 보여주었다고 평가했다.GLP-1 유사체 중에서는 리라글루타이드만이 모든 원인과 심혈관질환에 의한 사망을 유의하게 줄였고, 세마글루타이드만이 비치명적 뇌졸중을 유의하게 감소시켰다고 밝혔다.특히 다양한 메타분석 결과를 소개하며 계열의 심혈관질환 보호효과를 강조한 SGLT-2 억제제와는 달리 GLP-1 유사체에 대해서는 메타분석에서 확인된 계열의 보호효과와는 별개로 이를 GLP-1 유사체에 일반화 시키는 것에는 의문점이 있다고 언급했다. ◇CVOT 축적, 가이드라인 업데이트 가능성 열어둬SGLT-2 억제제는 다파글리플로진의 CVOT 데이터(DECLARE)는 심혈관 질환을 겪은 환자들을 대상으로 2차 예방의 효과를 확인했던 엠파글리플로진의 CVOT 데이터(EMPA-REG)와는 달리 심혈관질환 이력이 없는, 1차 예방을 목적으로 한 환자들이 포함됐다.그러나 이번 진료지침에는 이에 대해서는 언급하지 않았다. 대상이 '죽상경화성 심혈관질환을 동반한 환자'로, 이미 2차 예방을 전제로 하고 있기 때문.다만, 2차 예방 환자에서의 효과를 포함한 DECLARE 하위분석 결과는 최근에 발표돼 반영되지 않은 것으로 알려졌다.CIRCULATION지에 게재된 DECLARE 하위분석에 따르면, 다파글리플로진 역시 심혈관질환 이력이 있는 환자에서 위약군에 비해 주요심혈관계사건(MACE)이나 심혈관질환으로 인한 사망 또는 심부전으로 인한 입원 감소에 있어 더 큰 차이를 보이는 것으로 나타났다.이처럼 최근 들어 임상적으로 의미 있는 CVOT 데이터들이 많이 발표되고 있어, 연내 진료지침의 부분개정 가능성도 열려있다는 것이 학회측의 설명이다.◇1형 당뇨병 최초 경구용 치료제 예측 빗나가한편, 이번 진료지침에서는 제1형 당뇨병에서도 GLP-1 유사체와 SGLT-2 억제제의 가능성이 있음을 소개했다.GLP-1 유사체 중에서는 리라글루타이드나 엑세나타이드(바이에타, 아스트라제네카)가, SGLT-2 억제제 중에서는 카나글리플로진(인보카나, 얀센)이나 엠파글리플로진, 다파글리플로진, 인슐린에 추가할 경우 추가적인 혈당강하효과와 함께 체중감소 효과도 확인됐다는 것.뿐만 아니라 SGLT1/2 억제제인 소타글리플로진(진퀴스타, 사노피)도 인슐린에 추가할 경우 체중 및 당화혈색소 감소 효과가 있으나 SGLT-2 억제제와 마찬가지로 케톤산증 빈도 증가가 나타났다고 부연했다.아울러 소타글리플로진이 미FDA에서 제1형 당뇨병환자에 사용허가 여부를 심사 중으로, 허가를 획득하면 제1형 당뇨병 최초의 경구약제가 될 수 있다고 언급했다.그러나 최근 미FDA는 소타글리프로진의 허가 신청을 반려했다. 반면, 유럽집행위원회는 제1형 당뇨병에 소타글리플로진에 앞서 다파글리플로진을 허가했다.가이드라인의 예상과 달리 다파글리플로진이 제1형 당뇨병 최초의 경구약제가 된 것으로, 학회 측으로서는 머쓱한 상황이 됐다. &lt; 저작권자 © 의약뉴스 무단전재 및 재배포금지 &gt;",https://t.co/dkje0oY2II,news

Veggies Rule: As an Adjunct to Your Starches Leafy Greens Reduce Postprandial Glycemia + Insulin and Boost the Production of the Anti-Obesogenic Satiety Hormone GLP-1 - SuppVersity: Nutrition and Exercise Science for Everyone,"Don't worry, you don't have to eat veggies only for the rest of your life, but you should never eat a meal without them!I've been writing about the ""add fat to your carbs to ameliorate the obesogenic insulin response"" bullsh*t before (see ""True or False? Adding Fat to A Carby Meal Lowers Insulin Response. Muscle Hypertrophy Impairs Oxygen Diffusion. Reducing Carb Intake Improve Muscular Insulin Sensitivity"" | read more). What I have not been writing about before are better alternatives. Alternatives such as a huge bowl of veggies. A bowl like the one the participants in a recent study from the Graduate School of Human Sciences and Design at the Japan Women's University in Tokyo consumed as an adjunct to a standardized white rice meal.Add veggies to your rice!Basically, the scientists tested four different conditions. In condition (S), the participants consumed only the staple food (boiled white rice weighing 200 g heated in a microwave oven for 2 min). In condition (SM), the participants consumed the staple food (rice) and a main dish, in this case a boiled egg and tofu (soyabean curd). The third condition (SMF) was the same staple bowl of rice and main dish, but this time ""enhanced"" with an extra serving of fat from delicious mayonnaise.Table 1: Overview of the composition of the test meals (Kameyama. 2014)On the last out of four testing occasions, the normal-weight male study participants with an age between 30 and 49 years consumed the same high fat meal (SMF), but this time with an additional vegetable dish (SMFV) consisted of boiled spinach and boiled broccoli. Figure 1: Changes in plasma glucose, insulin, GIP and GLP-1 expressed relative to rice only (Kameyama. 2014)In view of the fact that I already gave away the results, I don't think the data in Figure 1 requires further interpretation, so let me just tell you this: Your mother was - as always - right, when she told you to eat your veggies - if you still don't understand why, it may be time to read up on the fat burning effects of GLP-1 (spec. ""Eat More, Burn More and Lose Fat Like on Crack with GLP-1!?"" | read more) and the role of GIP in the production and effects of insulin, here at the SuppVersity.You want more evidence that veggies are healthy - what about those?Bottom line: The study at hand provides yet another indisputable argument in favor of having large serving of vegetables with every meal. Contrary to common health-junky believe, the latter must not necessarily be spinach or broccoli. Dark leafy veggies are good, and even if they may not reduce your diabetes risk to the same extend ad leafy green ones do, they won't increase it in the way French fries, pizza and the alibi-salad on an Big Mac do... and I bet, variety - which has AFAIK hitherto not been investigated as a factor in type II diabetes, heart disease or stroke, will figure, as well, anyway.

FDA Delays Decision on Eli Lilly's Nasal Glucagon,"-Shahd HuseinEli Lilly and Company's hopes of bringing nasal glucagon to market may take longer than initially expected.At a recent earnings call on April 30th, Lilly announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has delayed their decision on the company's New Drug Application for a nasal glucagon, an alternative to injectable glucagon. The delay, according to Lilly, could take up to three months.The submission to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) occurred early last year after the completion of two Phase III studies, a jointly funded effort by Eli Lilly and Locemia Solutions, the company that initially developed nasal glucagon. The study was completed just three years after Lilly announced that they had acquired worldwide rights to nasal glucagon from Locemia Solutions.The FDA did not comment for this story on their decision to delay their decision on the novel glucagon treatment.Want more type 1 diabetes-related news stories, and the chance to help type 1 diabetes research? Take a moment to join T1D Exchange Glu now by clicking here.For the most recent study, researchers set out to understand if caregivers could use nasal glucagon to treat moderate to severe lows. Results from the study determined that caregivers of individuals living with diabetes felt comfortable nasally administering the drug, whereas loved ones typically felt discomfort with the current form of glucagon treatment, which includes a multi-step process of mixing and injecting the solution.Glucagon is a powerful, life-saving drug that is used to counter incidences of moderate to severe hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose levels. With Lilly's submission, the company hopes to bring an alternative solution to market, diversifying the ways in which to administer treatment, and giving individuals with diabetes and caregivers an easier option in seemingly stressful situations.Despite delays, Lilly is hopeful. ""We remain confident in nasal glucagon's submission package and look forward to FDA action in the coming months,"" said Dave Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly.We will continue to keep you posted on any decisions on nasal glucagon from the FDA and the EMA.",https://t.co/QfQXsimu5Q,news
ORMP: Data from Phase 1 Trial of Oral GLP-1 in 2Q19…,"By David Bautz, PhDNASDAQ:ORMPREAD THE FULL ORMP RESEARCH REPORTBusiness UpdateOramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP) is a biotechnology company with a proprietary oral protein delivery platform technology. The lead development candidate is ORMD-0801, an oral insulin, that is currently being tested in both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetics (T2D). The company is also developing ORMD-0901, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).ORMD-0801 UpdateType 1 Diabetics: In June 2018, the company initiated both a clamp study and a food effect study, and while these studies are enrolling T1D patients and healthy controls, investors should be aware that the data gleaned from these studies will be equally applicable to an approval in T2D. The clamp study is enrolling T1D patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 10% between the ages of 18-50. The clamp study was originally developed in 1979 as a means of testing how well a patient metabolizes glucose and their insulin sensitivity (DeFronzo et al., 1979). A clamp study is a requirement of all regulatory agencies around the world for performing pharmacodynamic studies of diabetes drugs in development. We anticipate results from this study in the first half of 2019. The food effect study is a single blind, five period, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study that is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 as a function of when the drug is administered in relation to meals. Up to 48 subjects (half healthy volunteers and half T1D patients) will be enrolled. We anticipate data from this study in mid-2019. Type 2 Diabetics: In April 2018, Oramed initiated a 90-day dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial designed to measure the effect of ORMD-0801 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is a prerequisite prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials. Recently, Oramed announced that the trial is over 75% enrolled. The company had previously found a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c following just 28 days of treatment in the company's prior Phase 2 clinical trial. High levels of blood glucose results in its binding to hemoglobin (becoming glycated). Since red blood cells survive for an average of 90 days, it typically takes this amount of time to determine the true effect a drug may be having on reducing glycated hemoglobin. We anticipate approximately 285 patients being enrolled in the trial, which will test 16, 24, and 32 mg doses of ORMD-0801 given once, twice, or three times a day. Topline results should be available before the end of 2019. NASH Study: On Oct. 4, 2018, Oramed announced the initiation of an exploratory proof-of-concept study to evaluate ORMD-0801 in patients suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will test the ability of ORMD-0801 to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH patients. NASH is inflammation and damage to the liver brought about by a buildup of fat and is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is often a ""silent"" liver disease as most patients with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. However, NASH can be severe and ultimately lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently estimated to affect two to five percent of the U.S. population (NIDDK) with the global market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2025 (Allied Market Research).License Deal in China: In 2015, Oramed signed a Technology License Agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubation of Technologies Co. Ltd. (HTIT), a Chinese company that owns a GMP-certified API insulin manufacturing facility. The agreement gave HTIT exclusive commercialization rights for ORMD-0801 in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. HTIT purchased $12 million in restricted stock and will pay 10% royalties on net sales along with up to $37.5 million in milestone payments. Oramed has already received $33 million. China represents a vast potential opportunity as there are over 100 million diabetic individuals in the country and approximately 500 million that are pre-diabetic.On Mar. 26, 2019, Oramed announced that HTIT had an IND application approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration, which will allow for the start of clinical trials for ORMD-0801 in China. ORMD-0901 UpdateOn September 17, 2018, Oramed announced that the U.S. FDA has approved the company's investigational new drug application (IND) to initiate clinical trials for ORMD-0901, an oral formulation of the GLP-1 analog exenatide. GLP-1 analogs mimic the action of GLP-1 and are currently used in the treatment of T2D, with sales of this class of drugs totaling $6.9 billion in 2017 (EvaluatePharma). On Jan. 22, 2019, the company announced that it initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ORMD-0901. It is a randomized, single blind, placebo controlled crossover study which will evaluate the safety of ORMD-0901 as well as its PK compared to placebo and open label Byetta® in up to 15 healthy subjects. We anticipate results from this trial the second quarter of 2019. Intellectual Property UpdateOn Mar. 28, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Protease Inhibitor-Containing Compositions, Compositions Comprising Same, and Methods for Producing and using Same"", which protects the protease inhibitors associated with the company's oral insulin technology. On Apr. 4, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Methods and Compositions for Oral Administration of Exenatide"", which provides IP protection for ORMD-0901, for which the company has recently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. Financial UpdateOn April 10, 2019, Oramed filed form 10-Q with financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 that ended February 28, 2019. The company reported revenues of $0.67 million, which are related to the license agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubator of Technologies Co., Ltd. (HTIT) singed in 2015. The revenues originating from that license agreement are recognized through June 2023. Cost of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $0.06 million, compared to $0.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was due to additional milestone payments received during the three months ending Feb. 28, 2019.R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $3.1 million, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the Phase 2b and GLP-1 pharmacokinetics clinical trials. G&amp;A expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.1 million, compared to $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. As of Feb. 28, 2019, Oramed had approximately $40.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term deposits and marketable securities. We estimate that the company has sufficient capital to fund operations for at least the next 18 months. As of Apr. 9, 2019, the company had approximately 17.4 million common shares outstanding and when factoring in stock options and warrants a fully diluted share count of approximately 21.6 million. ValuationWe value Oramed using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential future revenues from ORMD-0801 and ORMD-0901. We currently model for approval of ORMD-0801 in 2024 with first sales in 2025 and approval of ORMD-0901 in 2025 with first sales in 2026. We estimate for peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0801 of approximately $400 million and peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0901 of approximately $500 million. Using a 12% discount rate and a 60% probability of approval for ORMD-0801 and a 45% probability of approval for ORMD-0901 leads to a net present value for those two programs of $181 million and $152 million, respectively. When including the current cash total, potential cash from warrant exercises, and dividing by the fully diluted share count leads to a net present value for Oramed of approximately $18 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

We anticipate results from this trial the second quarter of 2019. Intellectual Property UpdateOn Mar. 28, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Protease Inhibitor-Containing Compositions, Compositions Comprising Same, and Methods for Producing and using Same"", which protects the protease inhibitors associated with the company's oral insulin technology. On Apr. 4, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Methods and Compositions for Oral Administration of Exenatide"", which provides IP protection for ORMD-0901, for which the company has recently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. Financial UpdateOn April 10, 2019, Oramed filed form 10-Q with financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 that ended February 28, 2019. The company reported revenues of $0.67 million, which are related to the license agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubator of Technologies Co., Ltd. (HTIT) singed in 2015. The revenues originating from that license agreement are recognized through June 2023. Cost of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $0.06 million, compared to $0.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was due to additional milestone payments received during the three months ending Feb. 28, 2019.R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $3.1 million, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the Phase 2b and GLP-1 pharmacokinetics clinical trials. G&amp;A expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.1 million, compared to $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. As of Feb. 28, 2019, Oramed had approximately $40.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term deposits and marketable securities. We estimate that the company has sufficient capital to fund operations for at least the next 18 months. As of Apr. 9, 2019, the company had approximately 17.4 million common shares outstanding and when factoring in stock options and warrants a fully diluted share count of approximately 21.6 million. ValuationWe value Oramed using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential future revenues from ORMD-0801 and ORMD-0901. We currently model for approval of ORMD-0801 in 2024 with first sales in 2025 and approval of ORMD-0901 in 2025 with first sales in 2026. We estimate for peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0801 of approximately $400 million and peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0901 of approximately $500 million. Using a 12% discount rate and a 60% probability of approval for ORMD-0801 and a 45% probability of approval for ORMD-0901 leads to a net present value for those two programs of $181 million and $152 million, respectively. When including the current cash total, potential cash from warrant exercises, and dividing by the fully diluted share count leads to a net present value for Oramed of approximately $18 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

ORMP: Data from Phase 1 Trial of Oral GLP-1 in 2Q19…,"By David Bautz, PhDNASDAQ:ORMPREAD THE FULL ORMP RESEARCH REPORTBusiness UpdateOramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP) is a biotechnology company with a proprietary oral protein delivery platform technology. The lead development candidate is ORMD-0801, an oral insulin, that is currently being tested in both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetics (T2D). The company is also developing ORMD-0901, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).ORMD-0801 UpdateType 1 Diabetics: In June 2018, the company initiated both a clamp study and a food effect study, and while these studies are enrolling T1D patients and healthy controls, investors should be aware that the data gleaned from these studies will be equally applicable to an approval in T2D. The clamp study is enrolling T1D patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 10% between the ages of 18-50. The clamp study was originally developed in 1979 as a means of testing how well a patient metabolizes glucose and their insulin sensitivity (DeFronzo et al., 1979). A clamp study is a requirement of all regulatory agencies around the world for performing pharmacodynamic studies of diabetes drugs in development. We anticipate results from this study in the first half of 2019. The food effect study is a single blind, five period, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study that is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 as a function of when the drug is administered in relation to meals. Up to 48 subjects (half healthy volunteers and half T1D patients) will be enrolled. We anticipate data from this study in mid-2019. Type 2 Diabetics: In April 2018, Oramed initiated a 90-day dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial designed to measure the effect of ORMD-0801 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is a prerequisite prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials. Recently, Oramed announced that the trial is over 75% enrolled. The company had previously found a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c following just 28 days of treatment in the company's prior Phase 2 clinical trial. High levels of blood glucose results in its binding to hemoglobin (becoming glycated). Since red blood cells survive for an average of 90 days, it typically takes this amount of time to determine the true effect a drug may be having on reducing glycated hemoglobin. We anticipate approximately 285 patients being enrolled in the trial, which will test 16, 24, and 32 mg doses of ORMD-0801 given once, twice, or three times a day. Topline results should be available before the end of 2019. NASH Study: On Oct. 4, 2018, Oramed announced the initiation of an exploratory proof-of-concept study to evaluate ORMD-0801 in patients suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will test the ability of ORMD-0801 to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH patients. NASH is inflammation and damage to the liver brought about by a buildup of fat and is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is often a ""silent"" liver disease as most patients with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. However, NASH can be severe and ultimately lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently estimated to affect two to five percent of the U.S. population (NIDDK) with the global market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2025 (Allied Market Research).License Deal in China: In 2015, Oramed signed a Technology License Agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubation of Technologies Co. Ltd. (HTIT), a Chinese company that owns a GMP-certified API insulin manufacturing facility. The agreement gave HTIT exclusive commercialization rights for ORMD-0801 in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. HTIT purchased $12 million in restricted stock and will pay 10% royalties on net sales along with up to $37.5 million in milestone payments. Oramed has already received $33 million. China represents a vast potential opportunity as there are over 100 million diabetic individuals in the country and approximately 500 million that are pre-diabetic.On Mar. 26, 2019, Oramed announced that HTIT had an IND application approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration, which will allow for the start of clinical trials for ORMD-0801 in China. ORMD-0901 UpdateOn September 17, 2018, Oramed announced that the U.S. FDA has approved the company's investigational new drug application (IND) to initiate clinical trials for ORMD-0901, an oral formulation of the GLP-1 analog exenatide. GLP-1 analogs mimic the action of GLP-1 and are currently used in the treatment of T2D, with sales of this class of drugs totaling $6.9 billion in 2017 (EvaluatePharma). On Jan. 22, 2019, the company announced that it initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ORMD-0901. It is a randomized, single blind, placebo controlled crossover study which will evaluate the safety of ORMD-0901 as well as its PK compared to placebo and open label Byetta® in up to 15 healthy subjects.

The company is also developing ORMD-0901, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).ORMD-0801 UpdateType 1 Diabetics: In June 2018, the company initiated both a clamp study and a food effect study, and while these studies are enrolling T1D patients and healthy controls, investors should be aware that the data gleaned from these studies will be equally applicable to an approval in T2D. The clamp study is enrolling T1D patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 10% between the ages of 18-50. The clamp study was originally developed in 1979 as a means of testing how well a patient metabolizes glucose and their insulin sensitivity (DeFronzo et al., 1979). A clamp study is a requirement of all regulatory agencies around the world for performing pharmacodynamic studies of diabetes drugs in development. We anticipate results from this study in the first half of 2019. The food effect study is a single blind, five period, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study that is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 as a function of when the drug is administered in relation to meals. Up to 48 subjects (half healthy volunteers and half T1D patients) will be enrolled. We anticipate data from this study in mid-2019. Type 2 Diabetics: In April 2018, Oramed initiated a 90-day dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial designed to measure the effect of ORMD-0801 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is a prerequisite prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials. Recently, Oramed announced that the trial is over 75% enrolled. The company had previously found a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c following just 28 days of treatment in the company's prior Phase 2 clinical trial. High levels of blood glucose results in its binding to hemoglobin (becoming glycated). Since red blood cells survive for an average of 90 days, it typically takes this amount of time to determine the true effect a drug may be having on reducing glycated hemoglobin. We anticipate approximately 285 patients being enrolled in the trial, which will test 16, 24, and 32 mg doses of ORMD-0801 given once, twice, or three times a day. Topline results should be available before the end of 2019. NASH Study: On Oct. 4, 2018, Oramed announced the initiation of an exploratory proof-of-concept study to evaluate ORMD-0801 in patients suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will test the ability of ORMD-0801 to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH patients. NASH is inflammation and damage to the liver brought about by a buildup of fat and is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is often a ""silent"" liver disease as most patients with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. However, NASH can be severe and ultimately lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently estimated to affect two to five percent of the U.S. population (NIDDK) with the global market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2025 (Allied Market Research).License Deal in China: In 2015, Oramed signed a Technology License Agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubation of Technologies Co. Ltd. (HTIT), a Chinese company that owns a GMP-certified API insulin manufacturing facility. The agreement gave HTIT exclusive commercialization rights for ORMD-0801 in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. HTIT purchased $12 million in restricted stock and will pay 10% royalties on net sales along with up to $37.5 million in milestone payments. Oramed has already received $33 million. China represents a vast potential opportunity as there are over 100 million diabetic individuals in the country and approximately 500 million that are pre-diabetic.On Mar. 26, 2019, Oramed announced that HTIT had an IND application approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration, which will allow for the start of clinical trials for ORMD-0801 in China. ORMD-0901 UpdateOn September 17, 2018, Oramed announced that the U.S. FDA has approved the company's investigational new drug application (IND) to initiate clinical trials for ORMD-0901, an oral formulation of the GLP-1 analog exenatide. GLP-1 analogs mimic the action of GLP-1 and are currently used in the treatment of T2D, with sales of this class of drugs totaling $6.9 billion in 2017 (EvaluatePharma). On Jan. 22, 2019, the company announced that it initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ORMD-0901. It is a randomized, single blind, placebo controlled crossover study which will evaluate the safety of ORMD-0901 as well as its PK compared to placebo and open label Byetta® in up to 15 healthy subjects. We anticipate results from this trial the second quarter of 2019. Intellectual Property UpdateOn Mar. 28, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Protease Inhibitor-Containing Compositions, Compositions Comprising Same, and Methods for Producing and using Same"", which protects the protease inhibitors associated with the company's oral insulin technology. On Apr. 4, 2019, Oramed announced the allowance of a U.S. Patent for the technology ""Methods and Compositions for Oral Administration of Exenatide"", which provides IP protection for ORMD-0901, for which the company has recently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. Financial UpdateOn April 10, 2019, Oramed filed form 10-Q with financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 that ended February 28, 2019. The company reported revenues of $0.67 million, which are related to the license agreement with Hefei Tianhui Incubator of Technologies Co., Ltd. (HTIT) singed in 2015. The revenues originating from that license agreement are recognized through June 2023. Cost of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $0.06 million, compared to $0.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was due to additional milestone payments received during the three months ending Feb. 28, 2019.R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $3.1 million, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the Phase 2b and GLP-1 pharmacokinetics clinical trials. G&amp;A expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.1 million, compared to $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. As of Feb. 28, 2019, Oramed had approximately $40.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term deposits and marketable securities. We estimate that the company has sufficient capital to fund operations for at least the next 18 months. As of Apr. 9, 2019, the company had approximately 17.4 million common shares outstanding and when factoring in stock options and warrants a fully diluted share count of approximately 21.6 million. ValuationWe value Oramed using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential future revenues from ORMD-0801 and ORMD-0901. We currently model for approval of ORMD-0801 in 2024 with first sales in 2025 and approval of ORMD-0901 in 2025 with first sales in 2026. We estimate for peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0801 of approximately $400 million and peak U.S. sales of ORMD-0901 of approximately $500 million. Using a 12% discount rate and a 60% probability of approval for ORMD-0801 and a 45% probability of approval for ORMD-0901 leads to a net present value for those two programs of $181 million and $152 million, respectively. When including the current cash total, potential cash from warrant exercises, and dividing by the fully diluted share count leads to a net present value for Oramed of approximately $18 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

School Nurse Breaks A Rule To Save A Life,"Last year, a school nurse in East Moline faced a moral dilemma when a diabetic student lost consciousness in her office. Now she's trying to make sure no other school nurse has to face the same tough choice. Low blood sugar can usually be cured with orange juice and a granola bar. But those snacks and glucose tabs weren't helping the 7th grader sitting in Jennifer Jacobs' office. ""Her blood sugar kept falling, and we kept pushing the snacks,"" Jacobs says. Jacobs is a nationally certified school nurse with 30 years of experience — 17 of those at Glenview Middle School. She was on her lunch break when the student came in, so Jacobs' assistant, a licensed practical nurse, started treatment. ""Within probably five or 10 minutes of my returning from lunch,"" Jacobs says, ""the student fell on the floor. [She] wasn't seizing but was tremoring, and her eyes were rolling back in her head…"" Jacobs applied glucose gel inside the student's cheek, but the meds just slid out of her mouth in a stream of drool. The student was crashing. ""It was beyond anything that we could do,"" Jacobs says. Well, it was beyond anything they could do legally. But Jacobs and her assistant both knew there was one more medication, made specifically for such emergencies, right there within reach. It's a hormone called glucagon. Once injected, it can help a diabetic recover from a crash, by stimulating the release of stored glucose. The problem was: The only glucagon kit in the office belonged to another diabetic student — not to the 7th grader drooling on the floor. Could they use that glucagon to treat this student? To Jacobs, that wasn't the right question. ""In my mind, I'm thinking, well I could lose my RN license for this. I could lose everything. I'm putting the school district at a huge liability risk. I mean, it could've been hugely detrimental,"" she says. ""But how do you not do this to save the girl's life? How do you not? It just comes down to that. How do you not?"" The only other option was simply unthinkable. ""The progression for untreated severe hypoglycemia would be seizures and to stop breathing and to die,"" she says. Jacobs made a split-second decision. She grabbed the glucagon and injected the student. Paramedics arrived and had to administer a second dose of glucagon en route to the hospital. ""This girl was crashing so severely that the one I administered wasn't even affecting her,"" Jacobs says. ""Think what would've happened if I hadn't used that one. That gives me goosebumps. That makes me nauseous."" She had urged the girl's family to provide a glucagon kit. The student was ""a very brittle diabetic,"" Jacobs says, meaning her blood sugar levels tended take sudden swings. But such severe hypoglycemic episodes are relatively rare. In fact, this incident was the first time Jacobs had to give anyone glucagon in her 30-year career. So she understands why the family hadn't gotten around to providing glucagon. ""There are so many reasons, so many obstacles,"" Jacobs says. ""When you're talking about buying all the supplies needed by a diabetic to manage their diabetes, the cost is astronomical. And this family not only had their 7th grade daughter but they have an 8th grade son and the father and the mother all have diabetes. Three of the four are insulin-dependent."" Jacobs called the other student's family immediately, and the school district replaced their child's glucagon the next day. The girl who experienced the hypoglycemic crash made a full recovery. But for Jacobs, that's not a happy enough ending. She persuaded her state representative — Democrat Michael Halpin, of Rock Island — to file legislation allowing schools to buy glucagon and keep it on hand. ""It just makes sense,"" she says. ""We have a school-provided inhaler for students that have severe asthmatic reactions. And schools have EpiPens for severe allergic reactions. And we have Narcan to be used for opioid overdoses."" Halpin's bill has cleared the House and is set to be heard in the Senate. It's gotten unanimous approval at each step of the legislative process, so lawmakers apparently agree with the decision Nurse Jacobs made that day. As she would say: How could you not?",https://t.co/bfU8G5RDd1,news
GLP-1 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,"We read with interest Muskiet and colleagues' Review1Muskiet MHA Wheeler DC Heerspink HJL New pharmacological strategies for protecting kidney function in type 2 diabetes. on new pharmacological strategies for protecting kidney function in type 2 diabetes. In the Review—and specifically in figure 2—it is taken for granted that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists inhibit both angiotensin II and renin. We agree with the authors about the activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) by sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors through volume depletion, shown in figure 2. However, although it has been shown that GLP-1 receptor agonists inhibit the formation of angiotensin II,2Skov J Pedersen M Holst JJ et al.Short-term effects of liraglutide on kidney function and vasoactive hormones in type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial., 3Skov J Persson F Frøkiær J Christiansen JS Tissue renin–angiotensin systems: a unifying hypothesis of metabolic disease. inhibition of renin by these drugs is not supported by clear evidence.GLP-1 receptor agonists inhibit angiotensin II through two possible mechanisms. First, angiotensin inhibition could be a result of a decrease in renin secretion through the macula densa after activation of tubuloglomerular feedback, because of the natriuresis produced by inhibiting sodium–hydrogen exchanger 3 in the proximal tubule. However, this theoretical mechanism has not been adequately clarified. The second mechanism is mediated by direct inhibition of angiotensin II production in tissues.2Skov J Pedersen M Holst JJ et al.Short-term effects of liraglutide on kidney function and vasoactive hormones in type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial., 3Skov J Persson F Frøkiær J Christiansen JS Tissue renin–angiotensin systems: a unifying hypothesis of metabolic disease.Several examples show the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on angiotensin II and a null effect on renin. In a 12-week trial done with sitagliptin and liraglutide in overweight patients, no change in plasma renin concentration was seen at the end of the study with either dug, when both were compared with placebo.4Tonneijck L Smits MM Muskiet MHA et al.Renal effects of DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin or GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In a trial in healthy men given a 2 h infusion of GLP-1, although there was a significant decrease in angiotensin II (19%), there were no changes in renin, aldosterone, or urinary angiotensinogen excretion.5Skov J Dejgaard A Frøkiær J et al.Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1): effect on kidney hemodynamics and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in healthy men. In another trial,2Skov J Pedersen M Holst JJ et al.Short-term effects of liraglutide on kidney function and vasoactive hormones in type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial. done in 11 men with type 2 diabetes, assessing a single dose of liraglutide compared with placebo, a decrease in angiotensin II (21%) was seen with liraglutide, but no changes in the concentrations of other components of the RAAS were observed (although plasma renin activity was not measured).Although studies show evidence of a decrease in angiotensin II caused by GLP-1 receptor agonists via the mechanisms described above, it is possible that this effect is amplified by the local effect on the production of angiotensin II that is generated by the activation of the tubuloglomerular feedback. However, the full mechanism has not been clearly shown in studies because there are variations in renin concentration and activity. More studies are needed to investigate the effect of GLP-1 on the RAAS that differentiate the activity of plasma renin from plasma renin concentration.We declare no competing interests.ReferencesMuskiet MHA Wheeler DC Heerspink HJL New pharmacological strategies for protecting kidney function in type 2 diabetes.Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2018; ()Skov J Pedersen M Holst JJ et al.Short-term effects of liraglutide on kidney function and vasoactive hormones in type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial.Diabetes Obes Metab. 2016; 18: 581-589Skov J Persson F Frøkiær J Christiansen JS Tissue renin–angiotensin systems: a unifying hypothesis of metabolic disease.Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2014; 5: 23Tonneijck L Smits MM Muskiet MHA et al.Renal effects of DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin or GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Diabetes Care. 2016; 39: 2042-2050Skov J Dejgaard A Frøkiær J et al.Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1): effect on kidney hemodynamics and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in healthy men.J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2013; 98: E664-E671Article InfoPublication HistoryPublished: March 07, 2019Copyright© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Women experienced greater weight loss vs. men (mean, –4.1 vs. –3.1; P = .007), according to researchers.Independent determinants of a 1% HbA1c reduction were baseline HbA1c, age, diabetes duration and background insulin therapy, according to researchers.In results stratified by GLP-1 receptor agonist type, researchers found that the reduction in weight or HbA1c and the proportion of patients achieving a HbA1c reduction of at least 1% was larger among adults prescribed liraglutide (Victoza, Novo Nordisk) vs. exenatide (Byetta/Bydureon, AstraZeneca) and lixisenatide (Adlyxin, Sanofi).""The results showed that this class of antidiabetic drugs works in different groups of patients with type 2 diabetes, but the response varied depending on the characteristics of the patient and the prescribed drug,"" Mauricio said. ""Identifying and prospectively differentiating profiles of subjects that predict the odds of response to GLP-1 receptor agonists should help physicians when making medication choices in complex patients. For example, long diabetes duration and prior insulin therapy seemed to decrease the probabilities of achieving an HbA1c reduction of at least 1% in our study. Conversely, a high pretreatment HbA1c value, older age or use of liraglutide were predictors of meaningful glycemic response.""PAGE BREAKMauricio said the findings speak to a need to conduct large observational studies in real-world settings to characterize the clinical interindividual differences in therapeutic response to antidiabetic drugs.""Variables such as medication adherence or the effect of adverse events on treatment discontinuation need to be specifically studied to assess how they impact the clinical results,"" Mauricio said. – by Regina Schaffer For more information: Didac Mauricio, MD, PhD, can be reached at the Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Sant Quinti, 89, 08041, Barcelona, Spain; email: didacmauricio@gmail.com.

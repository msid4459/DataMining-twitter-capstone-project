Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy,"AbstractBackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide, but few effective long-term treatments are available. In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.MethodsIn this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to &lt;90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], &gt;300 to 5000) and were treated with renin–angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of &lt;15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.ResultsThe trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. At that time, 4401 patients had undergone randomization, with a median follow-up of 2.62 years. The relative risk of the primary outcome was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.82; P=0.00001). The relative risk of the renal-specific composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the creatinine level, or death from renal causes was lower by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P&lt;0.001), and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was lower by 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.86; P=0.002). The canagliflozin group also had a lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; P=0.01) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of amputation or fracture.ConclusionsIn patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events was lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 2.62 years.

"Pumps, Pipes, and Filters: SGLT2 Inhibitors for Most Type 2 Diabetes?","Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors should be considered for use in most patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or history of heart failure, according to the authors of a new meta-analysis of the three major cardiovascular outcomes trials with these drugs. The meta-analysis was conducted by a group led by Thomas A. Zelniker, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. It includes data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial with empagliflozin (Jardiance, Boehringer Ingelheim/Lilly), the CANVAS program with canagliflozin (Invokana, Janssen), and the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial with dapagliflozin (Farxiga/Forxiga, AstraZeneca), with a total of 34,322 patients (60.2% with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), 3342 major adverse cardiovascular events, 2028 cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heart failure events, and 766 renal composite outcomes. The meta-analysis was published online on November 10 in The Lancet. Results show that across the three trials, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 11% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83 - 0.96), with benefit only seen in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80 - 0.93) and not in those without (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.87 - 1.16). But the SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure by 23% (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 - 0.84), with a similar benefit in patients with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and with and without a history of heart failure. The drugs also reduced the risk of renal disease progression by 45% (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.48 - 0.64), with a similar benefit in those with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The magnitude of benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors varied with baseline renal function, with greater reductions in hospitalizations for heart failure and lesser reductions in progression of renal disease in patients with more severe kidney disease at baseline. ""These data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors should be considered in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or history of heart failure, given that SGLT2 inhibitors safely reduce HbA1c and reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and progression of renal disease across a broad spectrum of patients with type 2 diabetes,"" the authors conclude. And, they stress, ""Reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events can also be expected in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."" In an accompanying editorial, Subodh Verma, MD, of St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and colleagues, say the meta-analysis ""provides compelling evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors should now be considered as first-line therapy after metformin in most people with type 2 diabetes, irrespective of whether or not they have established atherosclerotic vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure."" The editorialists suggest that separation of primary versus secondary prevention may not be appropriate in patients with diabetes. Totality of Data Makes Several Patterns Clear, Helps Elucidate Mechanism ""The totality of these data now makes several patterns clear,"" say Zelniker and colleagues in their article. ""First, SGLT2 inhibitors have their greatest and most consistent effect on reducing the relative risk of hospitalization for heart failure (31%) and of progression of renal disease (45%)."" ""Their effect on the composite atherosclerotic outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (major adverse cardiac events), originally a safety outcome stemming from regulatory guidance, was more modest but still significant, with an 11% reduction in relative risk."" ""Second, for particular outcomes the clinical effects of SGLT2 inhibitors depend on the patient population in which they are used."" ""The reduction in major adverse cardiac events was apparent only in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, whereas no effect was observed in patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."" Conversely, ""the reduction in hospitalization for heart failure was robust and of similar magnitude regardless of the presence of established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a history of heart failure. The reduction in progression of renal disease was also equally robust in patients with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."" Zelniker and colleagues also say these latest data help elucidate the mechanism of action of these drugs. ""Our data suggest that the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors coupled with the natriuresis they induce might largely explain the reduction in hospitalization for heart failure."" Patients with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline are at an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure, they explain. ""Therefore, renoprotection and natriuresis induced by SGLT2 inhibitors could be of particular benefit in this susceptible population."" Reductions in both the progression of kidney disease and hospitalization for heart failure and their attendant interventions and downstream complications might then reduce the risk of both cardiovascular and all-cause death, they theorize. However, ""the beneficial effect on myocardial infarction remains a topic of active investigation."" ""By and Large"" Results Were Consistent Across Three Trials They further note that ""by and large"" the results were consistent between the three different trials of SGLT2 inhibitors. However, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular death was more pronounced than that of canagliflozin or dapagliflozin, and an increased risk of amputations and fractures was only seen with canagliflozin. ""Although it is theoretically possible that drug-specific differences in effects exist within this class, other possibilities should be considered,"" they write, adding that ""multiple differences were found in the patient characteristics in each trial that might explain the observed variations with regard to cardiovascular death, and subgroup analyses by one variable might not fully capture other important differences."" On the safety of these drugs, the authors state: ""Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated and generally safe drugs, although patients have an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, which are usually easily managed and uncommonly recur."" SGLT2 inhibitors do appear to increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, but the rates were very low and risk can be reduced with proper patient education and vigilance. ""Also, initial concerns about safety signals for stroke were not supported in the present meta-analysis. An increased risk of amputation and fracture was seen only in one trial."" Numbers Needed to Treat, Call for Cost-Effectiveness Studies In their editorial, Verma and colleagues say the separation of primary versus secondary prevention may not be appropriate in type 2 diabetes because this distinction ""is entirely based on atherosclerotic risk and not risk of hospitalization for heart failure or renal disease."" And this meta-analysis indicates that, irrespective of atherosclerotic vascular disease, declining renal function is strongly associated with hospitalization for heart failure and renal disease progression, ""outcomes uniquely sensitive to SGLT2 inhibitor therapy,"" they emphasize. ""We therefore propose that whereas the nomenclature of primary versus secondary prevention is appropriate for atherosclerotic outcomes, it is likely to be inappropriate for a person with type 2 diabetes who is at risk of hospitalization for heart failure and renal disease."" They note that the latest American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes joint position statement has prioritized the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. But they propose that these drugs should be considered in an even broader population of people with type 2 diabetes and multiple risk factors, which they say is supported by the current meta-analysis. The editorialists calculate that from the available analyses, the absolute risk reductions over 5 years are estimated to be about 0.8% for hospitalization for heart failure and about 1.4% for renal disease progression in patients with multiple risk factors, which would yield numbers needed to treat of 124 to prevent one hospitalization for heart failure and 73 to prevent one episode of renal disease progression over 5 years. ""Some might argue that the economic effect of preventing hospitalization for heart failure and transition to end-stage renal disease is much greater than preventing a nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, and formal cost-effectiveness analyses in this regard will be instructive,"" they conclude. Zelniker reports research grants to his institution from AstraZeneca and grants from Bristol-Myers Squibb during the conduct of the study. Verma has received research support and honoraria from Amgen, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen, Merck, and Novo Nordisk. Disclosures for the other authors are listed with the article.

"Glomerular Hyperfiltration in Diabetes: Mechanisms, Clinical Significance, and Treatment","AbstractAn absolute, supraphysiologic elevation in GFR is observed early in the natural history in 10%–67% and 6%–73% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Moreover, at the single-nephron level, diabetes-related renal hemodynamic alterations—as an adaptation to reduction in functional nephron mass and/or in response to prevailing metabolic and (neuro)hormonal stimuli—increase glomerular hydraulic pressure and transcapillary convective flux of ultrafiltrate and macromolecules. This phenomenon, known as glomerular hyperfiltration, classically has been hypothesized to predispose to irreversible nephron damage, thereby contributing to initiation and progression of kidney disease in diabetes. However, dedicated studies with appropriate diagnostic measures and clinically relevant end points are warranted to confirm this assumption. In this review, we summarize the hitherto proposed mechanisms involved in diabetic hyperfiltration, focusing on ultrastructural, vascular, and tubular factors. Furthermore, we review available evidence on the clinical significance of hyperfiltration in diabetes and discuss currently available and emerging interventions that may attenuate this renal hemodynamic abnormality. The revived interest in glomerular hyperfiltration as a prognostic and pathophysiologic factor in diabetes may lead to improved and timely detection of (progressive) kidney disease, and could provide new therapeutic opportunities in alleviating the renal burden in this population.Driven by the ever-increasing prevalence of diabetes, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has become the most common cause of CKD, leading to ESRD, cardiovascular events, and premature death in developed and developing countries.1 In order to reduce the onset and progression of DKD, current management focuses on prevention, early identification, and treatment. Diabetes and nephrology guidelines advocate strict glycemic and BP targets, the latter for which renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are recommended in diabetes patients with2 and without3 albuminuria. Despite increased efforts that stabilized incidence rates for ESRD attributable to DKD in the United States over the last 5 years, the number of patients with renal impairment due to diabetes is still increasing.4 Therefore, improved and timely strategies are needed.In addition to albuminuria, reduced GFR is a pivotal marker in predicting the risk for ESRD and renal death in diabetes, whereas the role of increased GFR is uncertain. In the classic, five-stage, proteinuric pathway of DKD, the initial phase is characterized by an absolute, supraphysiologic increase in whole-kidney GFR (i.e., the sum of filtration in all functioning nephrons) (Figure 1). This early clinical entity, known as glomerular hyperfiltration, is the resultant of obesity and diabetes-induced changes in structural and dynamic factors that determine GFR.5 Reported prevalences of hyperfiltration at the whole-kidney level vary greatly: between 10% and 67% in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (with GFR values up to 162 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and 6%–73% in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (up to 166 ml/min per 1.73 m2, Table 1). In general, GFR increases by about 27% and 16% in recently diagnosed patients with T1DM6 and T2DM,7 respectively. The prevailing hypothesis is that hyperfiltration in diabetes precedes the onset of albuminuria and/or decline in renal function, and predisposes to progressive nephron damage by increasing glomerular hydraulic pressure (PGLO) and transcapillary convective flux of ultrafiltrate and, although modestly, macromolecules (including albumin). Furthermore, increased GFR in single remnant nephrons—to compensate for reduced nephron numbers8,9 and/or caused by stimuli of the diabetes phenotype—is proposed to accelerate renal function decline in longer-standing diabetes.Figure 1. Classic course of whole-kidney GFR and UAE according to the natural (proteinuric) pathway of DKD. Peak GFR may be seen in prediabetes or shortly after diabetes diagnosis, and can reach up to 180 ml/min in the case of two fully intact kidneys. Strict control of HbA1c and initiation of other treatments (such as RAS inhibition) mitigate this initial response. Two normal filtration phases can be encountered, in which GFR may be for instance 120 ml/min (indicated with the gray line): one at 100% of nephron mass and one at approximately 50% of nephron mass. Thus, whole-kidney GFR may remain normal even in the presence of considerable loss of nephron mass, as evidenced by a recent autopsy study.121 Assessing renal functional reserve and/or UAE may help identify the extent of subclinically inflicted loss of functional nephron mass. *Whole-kidney hyperfiltration is generally defined as a GFR that exceeds approximately 135 ml/min, and is indicated with the red line. Heterogeneity of single-nephron filtration rate and nonproteinuric pathway122 of DKD are not illustrated.Table 1. Prevalence studies of hyperfiltration in diabetesThis review summarizes proposed factors that underlie hyperfiltration in diabetes, and addresses evidence of this phenomenon as predictor and pathophysiologic factor in DKD. Furthermore, we discuss lifestyle and (emerging) pharmacologic interventions that may attenuate hyperfiltration.Definition and Measurement""Whole-Kidney"" HyperfiltrationAlthough a generally accepted definition is lacking, reported thresholds to define hyperfiltration vary between 130 and 140 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in subjects with two functioning kidneys,10 which corresponds to a renal function that exceeds two SD above mean GFR in healthy individuals.11 Notably, use of any set GFR cutoff does not consider differences between sexes and distinct ethnic populations,10 nephron endowment at birth,12 and age-related GFR decline.10,13 Identification of hyperfiltration in clinical practice and systematic studies is complicated by intra- and interday GFR fluctuations,14,15 and the inaccuracy of available serum creatinine–based GFR estimates.16 As such, the Cockroft–Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2009 equations systematically underestimate GFR in diabetes, and progressively more so with increasing GFR.16 This seems due to changes in tubular creatinine secretion in the setting of obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperfiltration, although high glucose concentrations also lead to overestimation of serum creatinine when the Jaffe reaction is used.16 eGFR on the basis of serum cystatin C is suggested to more accurately reflect renal function in patients with diabetes and normal or elevated GFR.17,18 Nevertheless, renal clearance techniques using inulin, or its more widely used alternative sinistrin, are required for gold standard measurement of GFR.19 However, because inulin and sinistrin require labor-intensive analysis, alternative well recognized, although less accurate, exogenous filtration markers across GFR values are widely used in clinical practice and research, such as (125I-labeled) iothalamate, iohexol, 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, and 99mTc-labeled diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid.19,20""Single-Nephron"" HyperfiltrationThe definition of hyperfiltration at the whole-kidney level disregards conditions in single nephrons, for which two distinct (frequently co-occurring) elements seem to be involved. First, in the natural history of DKD, with irreversible damage to progressively more glomeruli, remnant nephrons undergo functional and structural hypertrophy (glomeruli and associated tubules), thereby striving to maintain whole-kidney filtration and reabsorption within the normal range.21 Second, and regardless of renal mass, metabolic and (neuro)hormonal stimuli that prevail in diabetes and/or obesity (as discussed below) enhance filtration in single nephrons, even when whole-kidney GFR does not exceed 130–140 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (Figure 1). Given these considerations, hyperfiltration has also been defined as a filtration fraction11,22 (FF; the ratio between GFR and effective renal plasma flow [ERPF]) above 17.7%±2.8%, i.e., the mean±SD in healthy 22–25–year-old humans.23 In support of such a definition, a mean FF of 24% is observed in adolescents with uncomplicated T1DM and a GFR of 178 ml/min per 1.73 m2, whereas FF is 17% in those with a GFR of 111 ml/min per 1.73 m2.24 ERPF is measured using para-aminohippuric acid, radioiodine-labeled hippuran, or 99mTc-labeled mercaptoacetyltriglycine, which are removed from the circulation during a single pass through the kidney by approximately 90%,25 75%,25 or 55%,26 respectively. Whether FF is a valid approximation of PGLO is subject to debate, as the latter can only be directly measured by micropuncture. However, in humans there is no alternative,27 other than estimation with Gomez equations (using measured GFR and ERPF, and total protein).28,29 Some authors propose that a stress test, which is capable of exploiting the entire filtration capacity of the kidneys (known as the renal functional reserve; i.e., by means of a high-protein load, or infusion of amino acids or dopamine), could be a significant tool to identify a hyperfiltering state in patients with whole-kidney GFR within normal range, assuming that a preexisting elevation of PGLO and ERPF will prevent a rise in GFR (Figure 2).30,31 However, utility of such a diagnostic measure remains uncertain, as variability of renal functional reserve testing makes an impaired GFR response to a stimulus difficult to identify and hard to interpret.Figure 2. Schematic representation of renal functional reserve. Renal functional reserve is defined as the capacity of the kidney to compensate or increase its function in states of demand (e.g., high protein or fluid intake, pregnancy) or disease (e.g., diabetes, CKD).31 In early diabetes, when nephron mass is still &gt;50%, renal functional reserve may be reduced due to prevailing metabolic and (neuro)hormonal factors that increase baseline GFR. In later stages, additional renal hemodynamic adaptations occur in response to reduced renal mass, leading to continuous maximal use of glomerular filtration capacity.Pathogenesis of Hyperfiltration in DiabetesPathogenesis of hyperfiltration in diabetes is complex, comprising numerous mechanisms and mediators, with a prominent role for hyperglycemia and distorted insulin levels,32 especially in early diabetes33 and prediabetes.34 As such, prevalence of diabetes-related hyperfiltration may have been dropped due to earlier diagnosis and modern day stricter control of hyperglycemia and other factors (e.g., angiotensin II by means of RAS blockade). For example, reducing glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from 10% to 7%, which could be considered adequate glycemic control,35 normalized measured GFR from 149 to 129 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (16% reduction) in patients with T1DM on insulin pump therapy, whereas no effect on GFR was observed in the control group that continued conventional insulin treatment without changes in HbA1c.36 Notably, independent of diabetes and glucose levels,37 body weight also augments GFR (by about 15% in obese37 to about 56% in severely obese nondiabetic subjects38,39). Thus, especially in T2DM, hyperfiltration likely develops after and on top of body weight–induced increases in GFR, although such longitudinal data are not available. The mechanisms of hyperfiltration, which may overlap and act in concert, are briefly discussed at ultrastructural, vascular, and tubular level.Ultrastructural ChangesFrom the onset of diabetes, the kidneys grow large due to expanded nephron size (particularly hypertrophy of the proximal tubule).32,40 This phenomenon is most likely caused by various cytokines and growth factors in response to hyperglycemia,41 although obesity may also independently contribute to nephromegaly.11,42 Although increased kidney size36,43 and filtration surface area per glomerulus44 have been linked to hyperfiltration, it has been proven difficult to separate cause from effect.40 Some have suggested that (compensatory) hypertrophy occurs as a result of hyperfiltration.45 However, in animal studies, hypertrophy precedes hyperfiltration.41 Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase to reduce early diabetic tubular hypertrophy and—likely subsequent—proximal hyper-reabsorption of sodium (see below) diminishes hyperfiltration in direct proportion to the effect on kidney size in diabetic rats.46 Because tubular growth reverses slowly, and normalization of kidney size may not be achieved in patients with diabetes even after strict glycemic control, hyperfiltration could endure due to persistent tubular enlargement and changes in tubular functions.Vascular TheoryAccording to the ""vascular theory,"" hyperfiltration results from imbalance of vasoactive humoral factors that control pre-and postglomerular arteriolar tone leading to hyperfiltration, as depicted in Figure 3.8,32 Preferential sites of action of these factors are derived from infusion or blockade studies in preclinical models and humans, in which reduced FF is frequently related to a vasodilatory effect on the efferent arteriole or vasoconstrictive effect on the afferent arteriole. However, FF reduces also with proportional decreases in efferent and afferent arteriolar resistance (as the former decreases FF more than the latter increases FF), which denotes that changes in FF are not necessarily indicative for selective alteration in segmental vascular resistance (Supplemental Figure 1).47 As various vasoactive mediators are released or activated after a meal, they may be effectors in postprandial hyperfiltration (Figure 3).48 In addition, amino acids from digested proteins may directly49,50 and indirectly48 increase tubular reabsorption of sodium and subsequently inactivate tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF; see below).Figure 3. Schematic (net) effect of factors implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes. Several vascular and tubular factors32,48,123–126 are suggested to result in a net reduction in afferent arteriolar resistance, thereby increasing (single-nephron) GFR. Effects of insulin per se seem to depend on insulin sensitivity.96,97 A net increase in efferent arteriolar resistance—leading to increased GFR—is proposed for other vascular factors.32,42,71,124,127 Growth hormone128 and insulin-like growth factor-1129 likely increase filtration by augmenting total renal blood flow, without specific arteriolar preference. Glucagon and vasopressin seem to (principally) act through TGF.48 Intrinsic defects of electromechanical coupling or alterations in signal transduction in afferent arterioles may impair vasoactive responses to renal hemodynamic (auto)regulation.32 Augmented filtration by increases in the ultrafiltration coefficient, and net filtration pressure via reduction in intratubular volume and subsequent hydraulic pressure in Bowman's space are not depicted. Several vascular factors may be released or activated after a (high-protein) meal (e.g., nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2 prostanoids, angiotensin II),48,50,130 whereas TGF becomes (further) inhibited, through increased amino acid- (and glucose) coupled sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule49,50 and/or increased glucagon/vasopressin-dependent sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb.48 These changes may collectively play a part in postprandial hyperfiltration. COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; ETA, endothelin A receptor.Tubular TheoryThe ""tubular theory"" of hyperfiltration describes diabetes-related abnormalities in the close interaction between the glomerulus and tubule. It proposes that enhanced proximal tubular sodium (and glucose) reabsorption, paralleled by tubular growth32 and upregulation of sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) and sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE)3, leads to a reduction in afferent arteriolar resistance and increase in single-nephron GFR through inhibition of TGF (Figure 3).32,42,51 The raised intrarenal pressure in obese patients—due to increased intra-abdominal pressure and accumulation of peri-renal fat—compresses the thin loops of Henle, which may add to enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption.52–54 Finally, diabetes-associated tubular hyperplasia and hypertrophy32 and proximal tubular hyper-reabsorption reduce intratubular pressure and hydraulic pressure in Bowman's space, which further perpetuates hyperfiltration by increasing the net hydraulic pressure gradient.55,56Clinical Significance of Hyperfiltration in DiabetesElucidating the significance of hyperfiltration as an independent renal risk factor in diabetes is complicated by the complex multifactorial etiology of DKD, and the lack of dedicated studies that assess the influence of sustained or altered whole-kidney hyperfiltration and FF on long-term renal outcome. Hyperfiltration per se does not seem to fully explain adverse renal outcome, as the risk for ESRD in transplant donors (in which single-nephron GFR is typically increased by about 60%–70%)57 is very low.58 However, it may be suggested that the stimulus and/or prevailing diabetes play a part in the pathogenesis of hyperfiltration-induced renal damage. As such, an evaluation of 52,998 living kidney donors revealed that non-insulin-dependent diabetes was among the strongest predictors of developing ESRD after 15-years of follow up (hazard ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.91 to 4.74).59 To date, studies that report on the effects of whole-kidney level hyperfiltration in diabetes are observational in nature, whereas the clinical significance of single-nephron hyperfiltration in all phases of DKD is best deduced from RAS blockade trials. Finally, a potential pathophysiologic role of postprandial hyperfiltration in DKD is suggested in small-sized studies. We will discuss the significance of diabetic hyperfiltration using this somewhat artificial distinction.Whole-Kidney Hyperfiltration and Renal End Points: Observational StudiesSeveral epidemiologic studies in diabetes report associations between supraphysiologic GFR in diabetes and all-cause mortality.60,61 Furthermore, longitudinal cohort studies of 3–18 years' duration show that GFR declines more rapidly in patients with T1DM and T2DM with whole-kidney hyperfiltration compared with those with normal GFR at baseline.34,62–64 However, as GFR remained in the normal range at end of follow-up (i.e., ≥100 ml/min per 1.73 m2), it is unclear whether these observations indicate (pharmacologic) resolution of hyperfiltration (i.e., restoration of renal functional reserve), or loss of nephron mass. The latter is suggested in a recent 6-year observational cohort study, in which rapid eGFR decline was associated with baseline hyperfiltration and renal impairment in 509 patients with T1DM.65Additionally, numerous studies reported on the association of whole-kidney hyperfiltration with onset and progression of the surrogate renal end point albuminuria (Table 2). In a systematic review and meta-analysis of ten cohort studies involving 780 patients with T1DM, followed for a mean of 11.2 years,66 the pooled odds for developing albuminuria in patients with measured whole-kidney hyperfiltration at baseline was 2.71 (95% confidence interval, 1.20 to 6.11). In contrast, other large-sized studies that estimated GFR did not detect such an association.67,68 Moreover, several studies suggest that the absence of whole-kidney hyperfiltration in T1DM has a negative predictive value of approximately 95% for albuminuria development.69,70 In a post hoc analysis of 600 patients with T2DM, patients with persistent measured hyperfiltration, compared with those with normofiltration at inclusion or in whom hyperfiltration was ameliorated by metabolic and BP control at 6 months, were more likely to develop microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria over a follow-up of 4 years (hazard ratio, 2.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.3).62 These observations were maintained even after adjustment for various risk factors, including HbA1c, BP, and duration of diabetes. However, other reported series in T2DM, which were either smaller-sized or used eGFR, are not in line with these results (Table 2).Table 2. Observational studies on the association of hyperfiltration and albuminuria progression or nonprogression in diabetesDespite suggestive evidence that whole-kidney hyperfiltration could contribute to DKD development and progression in T1DM and perhaps T2DM, interpretation of the data is hampered by variations in metabolic control, BP, diabetes duration, and other confounding factors, as well as potential publication bias. To date, no prospective studies with adequate measured and hard end points have investigated the renoprotective potential of controlling early hyperfiltration.Single-Nephron Hyperfiltration and Renal End Points: RAS Blockade TrialsAs angiotensin II induces a net increase in postglomerular resistance,71 reducing its action with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) lowers FF and PGLO.72 Consequently, RAS blockers are known to variably increase serum creatinine, which may raise up to 30% in patients with CKD in the first month after treatment initiation, and is generally reversible after drug discontinuation.73 Furthermore, 3-week enalapril treatment reduced GFR and FF in 11 adolescents with uncomplicated T1DM and whole-kidney hyperfiltration.24Pivotal trials in patients with T1DM and T2DM, which indicated that RAS blockade reduces the rate of developing albuminuria and hard renal end points, independent from BP lowering, have placed these drugs at the cornerstone of renoprotective management.74 Notably, a greater initial fall in eGFR portends a slower subsequent decline in renal function in patients with T2DM assigned to the ARB losartan (Figure 4), which supports the notion that reducing single-nephron hyperfiltration ameliorates DKD risk.75 However, as there is a close relationship between PGLO and urinary albumin excretion (UAE),76 and RAS blockade benefits both renal risk factors, the independent contribution of each to long-term renal preservation remains unknown.Figure 4. An acute fall in eGFR in losartan-assigned T2DM patients with DKD is inversely correlated with the long-term eGFR slope, after correction for sex, baseline eGFR, diastolic BP, hemoglobin, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Data adapted from Holtkamp and colleagues.75Postprandial Hyperfiltration and Renal End Points: Speculative StudiesThe pathophysiologic role of meal-induced increases in (single-nephron) GFR, known as postprandial hyperfiltration, in the onset or progression of CKD is a re-emerging field of study, especially in the context of high-protein diets that aim to induce weight-loss in obesity and T2DM. As such, in a 7-day crossover study in healthy young men, high-protein intake (2.4 g/kg per day) compared with normal protein intake (1.2 g/kg per day) increased measured GFR, FF, and 24-hour UAE.77 As humans largely reside in the postprandial state, the excessive and prolonged metabolic and hormonal disturbances occurring after meal ingestion in diabetes could, in theory, unfavorably influence kidney function, and predispose to renal damage. Interestingly, a blunted rise in GFR after amino acid infusion or protein loading in the presence of a RAS inhibitor has been widely described, suggesting an added renoprotective benefit of these drugs.73,78,79 Yet, the long-term effect of diet-induced renal hemodynamic alterations (and its amelioration), independent of e.g., an increased renal acid load, on renal outcome in diabetes remains unclear.Current and Emerging Treatment OptionsAlthough glucose-lowering per se ameliorates diabetic hyperfiltration, especially in early-onset diabetes,80 some antihyperglycemic drugs exhibit glucose-independent properties that may directly and/or indirectly benefit this renal risk factor. Here, we briefly discuss a selection of currently available or promising emerging antihyperglycemic (Table 3) and other (nonantihyperglycemic) (Table 4) interventions that may favorably affect renal hemodynamics in human diabetes.Table 3. Current and emerging antihyperglycemic treatment options with the potential to reduce hyperfiltration in diabetesTable 4. Current and emerging nonantihyperglycemic treatment options with hyperfiltration-reducing potential in diabetesAntihyperglycemic DrugsSGLT2 InhibitorsBy concomitantly blocking glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, SGLT2 inhibitors not only improve glycemic control by inducing glycosuria in diabetes, but also increase urinary sodium excretion. Their proximal natriuretic effect may be enhanced by accompanied functional blockade of NHE3.81 Thus, SGLT2 inhibition could reduce (single-nephron) hyperfiltration in diabetes by (1) restoring sodium-chloride concentration at the macula densa and subsequent TGF-mediated afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction,82,83 and (2) increasing intraluminal volume causing a retrograde increase in hydraulic pressure in Bowman's space, which constrains filtration pressure.56 Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors consistently reduce bodyweight and BP, and may influence several vascular mediators of renal hemodynamics in both the fasting and postprandial state (e.g., a decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide and insulin, and an increase in glucagon, RAS components, and glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP–1]).In an 8-week add-on to insulin study, empagliflozin in uncomplicated T1DM patients with whole-kidney hyperfiltration (mean GFR 172±23 ml/min per 1.73 m2) demonstrated a glucose-independent 19% decrease in GFR, which was paralleled by a decline in ERPF and estimated PGLO and increase in afferent arteriolar resistance, as assessed by the Gomez equations.82,83 Finally, as the rise in circulating RAS components may have blunted the renal hemodynamic effect of empagliflozin in these RAS blockade naïve T1DM patients, it is tempting to speculate that combined use of SGLT2 inhibitors and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/ARBs may lead to synergistic renoprotective effects through combined blockade of neurohormonal and tubular factors.84 Surprisingly, FF increased during euglycemic-clamp conditions in the hyperfiltering patients, underlining the difficulty to unambiguously assess intrarenal hemodynamic changes. In longer-term trials in patients with T2DM, SGLT2 inhibitors initially reduce eGFR over a wide range of baseline values, which appears to be hemodynamically regulated as the reduction reverses after a washout period.85 In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, 48 months of empagliflozin versus placebo treatment in 7020 high-risk patients with T2DM induced an eGFR trajectory reminiscent of RAS blockade (Figure 5), and resulted in a 46% reduction in the composite of serum creatinine doubling (accompanied by eGFR of ≤45 ml/min per 1.73 m2), ESRD, or renal death.86 Notably, over the 34 days after empagliflozin discontinuation, a weekly increase in eGFR of approximately 0.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was observed, as compared with a small decrease in the placebo group. Other long-term SGLT2 inhibition studies in T2DM patients with primary or secondary renal outcomes are underway.76 Finally, the gastrointestinal effects of novel dual SGLT2/SGLT1 inhibitors (e.g., reduced gastric emptying rate and intestinal glucose uptake) could theoretically also contribute to PGLO reduction after meal ingestion.Figure 5. Renal function trajectory in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. In this study, 7020 patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk were randomly assigned to receive the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin (10 or 25 mg once daily) or placebo. After an initial drop in eGFR documented at week 4, renal function stabilized in empagliflozin-treated patients over the ensuing follow-up period, whereas among those patients receiving placebo, a steady decline of 1.67 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year in eGFR was observed. After 34 days of cessation of the study drug, the initial decrease in eGFR in all empagliflozin-treated patients was completely reversed with an adjusted mean difference from placebo in the change from baseline eGFR of 4.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (not depicted). Adapted from Wanner and colleagues.86GLP-1–Based TherapiesGLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)–4 inhibitors are associated with renal hemodynamic effects, potentially beyond glycemic control. As such, native GLP-1 infusion reduced creatinine clearance–measured GFR in obese, insulin resistant, hyperfiltering males, 25% of whom were diagnosed with T2DM.87 The long-acting GLP-1RA liraglutide reversibly reduced measured GFR and UAE in an uncontrolled open-label study involving 31 patients with T2DM.88 These observations have been attributed to a GLP-1–mediated inhibition of NHE3 (which assembles with DPP-4 in the proximal tubular brush border), thereby reducing proximal sodium reabsorption and GFR through activation of TGF.51 However, acute administration of GLP-1RA left GFR unaffected in patients with T2DM with normal renal function.89,90 Moreover, treatment with liraglutide or the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin compared with placebo in normoalbuminuric patients with T2DM (mean GFR 83 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and FF 23.7%) did not affect eGFR after 2 weeks, nor were there changes in inulin and para-aminohippuric acid–measured renal hemodynamics after 12 weeks.91 However, although 12-weeks' liraglutide treatment nonsignificantly reduced mean GFR of 75 by 5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in 27 albuminuric patients with T2DM with albuminuria, in a placebo-controlled crossover study, GFR decreased by &gt;30% in the two patients with whole-kidney hyperfiltration.92 Of future interest are postprandial renal hemodynamic actions of short-acting GLP-1RA (which have sustained inhibitory effects on gastric emptying rate and glucagon levels) or DPP-4 inhibitors.ThiazolidinedionesTwelve-weeks' treatment with the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone in patients with T2DM with and without albuminuria reduced GFR and FF.93 These observations were explained by vasodilator actions at the efferent arteriole through increased nitric oxide bioavailability.93,94 Studies in diabetic rats suggest that restoration of TGF signaling may also play a role.95InsulinIn the fasting state, insulin has been reported to either increase GFR and ERPF, or to have neutral effects, which seems to be dependent on insulin sensitivity.96,97 Interestingly, in T2DM with macroalbuminuria, the fast-acting insulin lispro blunted postprandial increase in GFR and RPF versus regular insulin, possibly due to inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-1–dependent renal vasodilation.98Glucagon Receptor AntagonistsHyperglucagonemia in the fasting and postprandial state contributes to elevated blood glucose and hyperfiltration in diabetes.48,99 Interestingly, glucagon levels increase in the course of DKD.100 Selective blockade of the glucagon receptor as a novel glucose-lowering target in diabetes could favorably influence renal hemodynamics.48Nonantihyperglycemic InterventionsNutritional ""Therapy""Improving the diet in diabetes may ameliorate DKD risk, but defining an optimal regime is heavily debated. Importantly, examining its independent influence on (postprandial) hyperfiltration and subsequent renal outcome is virtually impossible, as confounding factors are legion. Nevertheless, extremes of macronutrient intake, especially that of protein, should generally be avoided to reduce hyperfiltration and renal risk.101 As such, in (pre)hypertensive patients of the OmniHeart study, a high-protein diet (+10% of energy from protein) increased fasting eGFR by approximately 4 ml/min per 1.73 m2 compared with diets replacing protein with either carbohydrate or fat.102 Furthermore, guidelines direct to reduce sodium intake to &lt;2000 mg/d in order to prevent renal disease in diabetes.76 However, clinicians may be reluctant to advocate sodium restriction in diabetes. This is fueled on the one hand by the hypothesis of a ""salt-paradox"" in diabetes (i.e., a rise in single nephron GFR in response to salt restriction, due to enhanced sensitivity of proximal tubular sodium reabsorption and subsequent inhibition of TGF),103 and on the other by concerns about sympathetic nervous system and RAS activation with a low-salt diet.104Weight LossAlthough overweight and obesity are independently associated with increases in GFR, ERPF, and FF,38,105 hyperfiltration is absent in obese nondiabetic patients when GFR and RPF are indexed for individuals' body surface area (BSA) in many,11 but not all, studies.105 The rationale for BSA adjustments comes from observations in mammals that GFR and ERPF are proportional to kidney size, which in turn is typically proportional to body size. Also, dependency of kidney and body size is assumed, as the main function of the kidneys is to regulate total body volume and waste.106 However, BSA normalizations may not be appropriate given that individuals are endowed with a set number of nephrons, which do not change with weight gain.106 In addition, formulas like the Du Bois and Du Bois may not be accurate in severely obese (T2DM) subjects.106 Gastroplasty-induced weight loss from 145 to 97 kg reduced (nonindexed) GFR, ERPF, FF, and albuminuria in nondiabetic subjects.39 Notably, bariatric surgery in severely obese subjects, of whom 38% had diabetes, has recently been shown to reduce the 4.4-year risk for an eGFR decline of ≥30% and doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD by 58% and 57%, respectively, compared with a matched nonoperated cohort.77DiureticsThe carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide decreases sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate reabsorption at the level of the proximal tubule. Although acetazolamide is rarely used as a diuretic because its long-term natriuretic effect is modest,107 several studies have shown that this drug markedly reduces GFR in T1DM with whole-kidney hyperfiltration108,109 and DKD,110 likely by TGF activation and independent from sodium balance.107 Loop diuretics may not affect TGF, because inhibition of the Na-K-2Cl–cotransporter also blocks solute transport into macula densa cells,107 although discussion is ongoing.111 Thiazide diuretics and epithelial sodium channel blockers act distally of the macula densa and do not influence TGF signals. However, (novel selective nonsteroidal) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, finerenone) do induce an initial acute fall in eGFR in T2DM,112–114 possibly by increasing TGF sensitivity,115 which predicts a later favorable influence on the course of renal function.114Endothelin-A Receptor AntagonistsIncreased endothelin-1 concentrations contribute to DKD development by increasing PGLO, podocyte damage, and permeability to albumin. Conversely, selective endothelin-A receptor antagonists (e.g., avosentan and atrasentan), which alleviate vasoconstriction of the efferent renal arteriole, were shown to increase renal blood flow and reduce renal vascular resistance and FF in hypertensive CKD patients.116 In line with these hemodynamic observations, long-term treatment with endothelin-A receptor antagonists reduced residual albuminuria by 35%–50% and seemingly preserved renal function in patients with T2DM that were optimally treated for their DKD.117,118 As the antiproteinuric effect of this drug class is already evident after 1 week of treatment, and in concert with eGFR returns to pretreatment levels after cessation of therapy, a hemodynamic nature of response is suggested.117,119Concluding RemarksCKD due to diabetes continues to rise, indicating that current strategies in managing DKD do not suffice to halt renal risk in this population. Accumulating evidence suggests a prognostic and pathogenic role of glomerular hyperfiltration in the initiation and progression of DKD. However, especially as hyperfiltration and albuminuria are renal hemodynamically linked,76 dedicated prospective studies are needed to confirm whether targeting hyperfiltration improves clinically relevant end points (i.e., 30% or 40% eGFR decline,120 ESRD, and/or renal death).76 Several antihyperglycemic and nonhyperglycemic interventions are associated with ameliorated hyperfiltration. Whether these treatments add benefit in the ongoing search for renal risk reduction in diabetes is worth investigating in specifically designed (renoprotection) trials using active comparators, especially in patients with hyperfiltration at baseline.DisclosuresH.J.L.H. has consulted for AbbVie, Astellas, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen, and ZS-Pharma (all honoraria paid to employer).Copyright © 2017 by the American Society of Nephrology",https://t.co/2gwts9v6oV,others
Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy,"AbstractBackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide, but few effective long-term treatments are available. In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.MethodsIn this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo.

Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy,"AbstractBackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide, but few effective long-term treatments are available. In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.MethodsIn this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to &lt;90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], &gt;300 to 5000) and were treated with renin–angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of &lt;15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.ResultsThe trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. At that time, 4401 patients had undergone randomization, with a median follow-up of 2.62 years.

Possible Mechanism of Hematocrit Elevation by Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors and Associated Beneficial Renal and Cardiovascular Effects,"This review focuses on the postulated mechanism underlying elevation of erythropoietin, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and how this phenomenon is linked to reduced progression of chronic kidney disease, lower mortality, and a lower risk of heart failure hospitalization.SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is associated with a modest increase in hematocrit (2%–4%) relative to placebo, and this effect is consistent for all 4 SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and ertugliflozin). In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 2 or 3 chronic kidney disease, empagliflozin increases hematocrit regardless of renal function, whereas hematocrit is not increased by SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 4 chronic kidney disease. By their diuretic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors also increase urine volume, but this increase peaks at 24 hours after the start of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, and urine volume returns to baseline within 1 week, whereas hematocrit continues to increase over 2 months. Thus, the time course of the change in urine volume after the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is completely different from that of hematocrit, which means that the increase in hematocrit cannot be explained only by hemoconcentration resulting from diuresis. What other mechanisms could explain the elevation of hematocrit? The erythropoietin level increases after initiation of dapagliflozin treatment for diabetes mellitus and reaches a plateau in 2 to 4 weeks. The reticulocyte count increases concomitantly with erythropoietin, followed by elevation of hemoglobin and hematocrit.1 These clinical observations suggest that the increase in hematocrit associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy can be better explained by augmentation of erythropoiesis. Thiazides have a stronger diuretic effect than SGLT2 inhibitors, but administration of these drugs does not increase either hematocrit or erythropoietin production,1 so what mechanism is involved here?Reabsorption of glucose via SGLT2 in the proximal tubular epithelial cells consumes energy because the Na+/K+ pump must also be driven, and these cells have a highly developed mitochondrial network to supply ATP for the Na+/K+ pump. Glucose uptake via SGLT2 is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus, resulting in increased ATP consumption by the Na+/K+ pump. Oxygen consumption by the proximal tubular mitochondria increases to meet the high demand for ATP, resulting in a decrease in the tissue oxygen partial pressure in the renal cortex.2 Erythropoietin is produced by ""neural crest–derived"" fibroblasts residing near the proximal tubules in the kidney. Animal studies have shown that selective damage to the proximal tubular epithelial cells induces transdifferentiation of erythropoietin-producing fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.3 These transformed fibroblasts lose the capacity to produce erythropoietin and actively produce fibrogenic molecules instead. In chronic kidney disease, such transformation of erythropoietin-producing fibroblasts is the major source of fibrogenic myofibroblasts. However, myofibroblasts can revert back to erythropoietin-producing fibroblasts and recover their original physiological properties after resolution of proximal tubular epithelial cell injury. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the serum erythropoietin level is low even when kidney function is normal, and erythropoietin decreases further as the glycosylated hemoglobin level increases.4 The hypoxic microenvironment in the proximal tubules that arises from metabolic stress associated with excessive glucose resorption by the tubular epithelial cells may trigger the transformation of erythropoietin-producing fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which could explain the lower serum erythropoietin level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce ATP consumption by the Na+/K+ pump and alleviate metabolic stress in the proximal tubular epithelial cells, thus reducing hypoxia in the microenvironment around the proximal tubules. This may allow reversion of myofibroblasts to erythropoietin-producing fibroblasts to some extent, resulting in enhanced hematopoiesis and elevation of the hematocrit. Accordingly, the improvement of hematocrit is thought to be based on alleviation of renal stress, and clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors suppress not only the development of nephropathy but also the progression of chronic kidney disease.In post hoc mediation analyses of data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients–Removing Excess Glucose), the change of hematocrit (and hemoglobin) was estimated to mediate ≈50% of the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death by empagliflozin versus placebo. The most frequent forms of cardiovascular death are those typically seen in patients who have heart failure (sudden death, heart failure death, and presumed cardiovascular death with insufficient data to attribute a definite cause of death).Hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is closely linked to new onset or progression of heart failure as a result of hemodynamic overload and electric instability. The kidneys are densely innervated by afferent sensory nerves and efferent sympathetic nerves. An increase in afferent excitatory activity caused by renal stress leads to increased systemic sympathetic activity via communication with the central nervous system. Proof-of-principle studies in patients with essential hypertension have demonstrated that renal denervation reduces blood pressure and sympathetic activity by interrupting both the afferent sensory nerves and the efferent sympathetic nerves. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the hypoxic microenvironment around the proximal tubules increases afferent sensory nerve activity and provokes systemic sympathetic hyperactivity. Suppression of sympathetic hyperactivity by correcting renal abnormalities could be an important additional mechanism underlying the cardiovascular mortality benefit of empagliflozin.Suppression of sympathetic hyperactivity by SGLT2 inhibitors is supported by the consistent reduction of resting heart rate in patients using these drugs.5 Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy leads to an increase in urine volume. If the sympathetic nervous system were activated by the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, the resting heart rate should increase, but it actually decreases. The extent of resting heart rate reduction depends on the baseline rate, so SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the heart rate more markedly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a higher baseline rate.In conclusion, elevation of hematocrit after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can be regarded as a surrogate marker for reduction of metabolic stress on the proximal tubules or adjacent interstitium of the kidney (Figure). Elevation of hematocrit may also be closely linked to rectification of sympathetic hyperactivity, leading to reduction of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization risk.Figure. Possible mechanism by which sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2is) increase erythropoietin production. Diagram of the proximal renal tubular environment in a healthy adult (A), a patient with diabetes mellitus (B), and a patient with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2i therapy (C). SGTL2 is coupled with the Na+/K+ pump, which consumes ATP. In the healthy adult, fibroblasts around the proximal tubules produce erythropoietin (blue cells). In the patient with diabetes mellitus, glucose uptake via SGLT2 is increased, resulting in high ATP consumption by the Na+/K+ pump. To meet the high demand for ATP, oxygen consumption increases in the proximal tubular epithelial cells. This leads to local hypoxia and release of inflammatory cytokines by the stressed proximal tubular epithelial cells. Inflammatory cytokines stimulate the transformation of erythropoietin-secreting fibroblasts to myofibroblasts that lack the capacity to secrete erythropoietin, leading to decreased erythropoietin secretion despite local hypoxia. SGLT2is reduce ATP consumption by the Na+/K+ pump and alleviate metabolic stress in the proximal tubular epithelial cells, thus improving hypoxia and inflammation in the microenvironment around the proximal tubules and allowing myofibroblasts to revert to erythropoietin-producing fibroblasts.

Dapagliflozin-saxagliptin 'attractive' for type 2 diabetes with kidney disease,"medwireNews: Dapagliflozin, with or without saxagliptin, reduces albuminuria in people with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease when used in combination with antihypertensive treatments, DELIGHT study data show.Furthermore, using the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT)2 inhibitor and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor together achieved ""the dual objectives of effective lowering of blood glucose and reduction of urinary albumin excretion,"" Hiddo Heerspink (University of Groningen, the Netherlands) and co-authors write in The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology. They add: ""This beneficial profile makes the combination of these drugs a potentially attractive option to slow the progression of kidney and cardiovascular disease in these patients.""The phase III DELIGHT study included 448 patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease who were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of once-daily treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg (n=145), dapagliflozin 10 mg plus saxagliptin 2.5 mg (n=155), or placebo (n=148).At baseline, median urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ranged from 218.4 to 270.0 mg/g, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 47.7–50.2 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 8.2–8.6% (66.0–70.0 mmol/mol).By week 24, UACR was a significant 21% lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group, and it was a significant 38% lower in the dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group. The researchers note that the reductions were ""largely independent"" of simultaneous changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, eGFR, and uric acid. Heerspink and team also found that HbA1c was a signficant 0.58% lower in the dapagliflozin–saxagliptin group than in the placebo group at week 24, and was a non-significant 0.16% lower in the dapagliflozin-only group.They say: ""The reduction in HbA1c when saxagliptin is added to dapagliflozin is clinically relevant in patients with kidney impairment because the glycaemic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are attenuated when kidney function declines.""Both drugs were well tolerated by patients with no new safety signals observed.In accompanying commentary, Katherine Tuttle (University of Washington, Spokane, USA) stresses the importance of the finding ""that dapagliflozin and saxagliptin can be used together safely for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate- to severe chronic kidney disease.""She writes: ""Because there are few drugs available to treat hyperglycaemia without increasing risk of hypoglycaemia (and other adverse events) for this population, the current data provide reassurance about combining SGLT2 inhibition with an incretin mimetic.""Heerspink et al conclude that the DELIGHT data ""support the importance of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease when used in addition to guideline­recommended treatment.""However, they add: ""Whether or not this effect translates into improved kidney outcomes remains uncertain and requires dedicated outcome trials with longer follow-up.""By Laura Cowen medwireNews is an independent medical news service provided by Springer Healthcare. © 2019 Springer Healthcare part of the Springer Nature groupLancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2019; doi:10.1016/S2213-8587(19)30086-5Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2019; doi:10.1016/S2213-8587(19)30116-0See also:",https://t.co/j2Gne8MUJX,others

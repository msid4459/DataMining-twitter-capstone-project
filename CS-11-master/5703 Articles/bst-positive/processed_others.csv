"8 Health Benefits of Fasting, Backed by Science","Despite its recent surge in popularity, fasting is a practice that dates back centuries and plays a central role in many cultures and religions.Defined as the abstinence from all or some foods or drinks for a set period of time, there are many different ways of fasting.In general, most types of fasts are performed over 24–72 hours.Intermittent fasting, on the other hand, involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, ranging from a few hours to a few days at a time.Fasting has been shown to have many health benefits, from increased weight loss to better brain function.Here are 8 health benefits of fasting — backed by science.Share on PinterestSeveral studies have found that fasting may improve blood sugar control, which could be especially useful for those at risk of diabetes.In fact, one study in 10 people with type 2 diabetes showed that short-term intermittent fasting significantly decreased blood sugar levels (1).Meanwhile, another review found that both intermittent fasting and alternate-day fasting were as effective as limiting calorie intake at reducing insulin resistance (2).Decreasing insulin resistance can increase your body's sensitivity to insulin, allowing it to transport glucose from your bloodstream to your cells more efficiently.Coupled with the potential blood sugar-lowering effects of fasting, this could help keep your blood sugar steady, preventing spikes and crashes in your blood sugar levels.Keep in mind though that some studies have found that fasting may impact blood sugar levels differently for men and women.For instance, one small, three-week study showed that practicing alternate-day fasting impaired blood sugar control in women but had no effect in men (3).Summary Intermittent fasting and alternate-day fasting could help decrease blood sugar levels and reduce insulin resistance but may affect men and women differently.While acute inflammation is a normal immune process used to help fight off infections, chronic inflammation can have serious consequences for your health.Research shows that inflammation may be involved in the development of chronic conditions, such as heart disease, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (4).Some studies have found that fasting can help decrease levels of inflammation and help promote better health.One study in 50 healthy adults showed that intermittent fasting for one month significantly decreased levels of inflammatory markers (5).Another small study discovered the same effect when people fasted for 12 hours a day for one month (6).What's more, one animal study found that following a very low-calorie diet to mimic the effects of fasting reduced levels of inflammation and was beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory condition (7).Summary Some studies have found that fasting could decrease several markers of inflammation and may be useful in treating inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis.Heart disease is considered the leading cause of death around the world, accounting for an estimated 31.5% of deaths globally (8).Switching up your diet and lifestyle is one of the most effective ways to reduce your risk of heart disease.Some research has found that incorporating fasting into your routine may be especially beneficial when it comes to heart health.One small study revealed that eight weeks of alternate-day fasting reduced levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and blood triglycerides by 25% and 32% respectively (9).Another study in 110 obese adults showed that fasting for three weeks under medical supervision significantly decreased blood pressure, as well as levels of blood triglycerides, total cholesterol and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol (10).In addition, one study in 4,629 people associated fasting with a lower risk of coronary artery disease, as well as a significantly lower risk of diabetes, which is a major risk factor for heart disease (11).Summary Fasting has been associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease and may help lower blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol levels.Though research is mostly limited to animal research, several studies have found that fasting could have a powerful effect on brain health.One study in mice showed that practicing intermittent fasting for 11 months improved both brain function and brain structure (12).Other animal studies have reported that fasting could protect brain health and increase the generation of nerve cells to help enhance cognitive function (13, 14).Because fasting may also help relieve inflammation, it could also aid in preventing neurodegenerative disorders.In particular, studies in animals suggest that fasting may protect against and improve outcomes for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's (15, 16).However, more studies are needed to evaluate the effects of fasting on brain function in humans. Summary Animal studies show that fasting could improve brain function, increase nerve cell synthesis and protect against neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's.Many dieters pick up fasting looking for a quick and easy way to drop a few pounds.Theoretically, abstaining from all or certain foods and beverages should decrease your overall calorie intake, which could lead to increased weight loss over time.Some research has also found that short-term fasting may boost metabolism by increasing levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which could enhance weight loss (17).In fact, one review showed that whole-day fasting could reduce body weight by up to 9% and significantly decrease body fat over 12–24 weeks (18).Another review found that intermittent fasting over 3–12 weeks was as effective in inducing weight loss as continuous calorie restriction and decreased body weight and fat mass by up to 8% and 16% respectively (19).In addition, fasting was found to be more effective than calorie restriction at increasing fat loss while simultaneously preserving muscle tissue (19).Summary Fasting may increase metabolism and help preserve muscle tissue to reduce body weight and body fat.Human growth hormone (HGH) is a type of protein hormone that is central to many aspects of your health.In fact, research shows that this key hormone is involved in growth, metabolism, weight loss and muscle strength (20, 21, 22, 23).Several studies have found that fasting could naturally increase HGH levels.One study in 11 healthy adults showed that fasting for 24 hours significantly increased levels of HGH (24).Another small study in nine men found that fasting for just two days led to a 5-fold increase in the HGH production rate (25).Plus, fasting may help maintain steady blood sugar and insulin levels throughout the day, which may further optimize levels of HGH, as some research has found that sustaining increased levels of insulin may reduce HGH levels (26).Summary Studies show that fasting can increase levels of human growth hormone (HGH), an important protein hormone that plays a role in growth, metabolism, weight loss and muscle strength.Several animal studies have found promising results on the potential lifespan-extending effects of fasting.In one study, rats that fasted every other day experienced a delayed rate of aging and lived 83% longer than rats that didn't fast (27).Other animal studies have had similar findings, reporting that fasting could be effective in increasing longevity and survival rates (28, 29, 30).However, current research is still limited to animal studies. Further studies are needed to understand how fasting may impact longevity and aging in humans.Summary Animal studies have found that fasting could delay aging and increase longevity, but human research is still lacking.Animal and test-tube studies indicate that fasting may benefit the treatment and prevention of cancer.In fact, one rat study found that alternate-day fasting helped block tumor formation (31).Similarly, a test-tube study showed that exposing cancer cells to several cycles of fasting was as effective as chemotherapy in delaying tumor growth and increased the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs on cancer formation (32).Unfortunately, most research is limited to the effects of fasting on cancer formation in animals and cells.Despite these promising findings, additional studies are needed to look at how fasting may influence cancer development and treatment in humans.Summary Some animal and test-tube studies suggest that fasting could block tumor development and increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy.There are many different types of fasts, making it easy to find a method that fits your lifestyle.Here are a few of the most common types of fasting:Water fasting: Involves drinking only water for a set amount of time.Juice fasting: Entails only drinking vegetable or fruit juice for a certain period.Intermittent fasting: Intake is partially or completely restricted for a few hours up to a few days at a time and a normal diet is resumed on other days.Partial fasting: Certain foods or drinks such as processed foods, animal products or caffeine are eliminated from the diet for a set period.Calorie restriction: Calories are restricted for a few days every week.Within these categories are also more specific types of fasts.For example, intermittent fasting can be broken down into subcategories, such as alternate-day fasting, which involves eating every other day, or time-restricted feeding, which entails limiting intake to just a few hours each day.To get started, try experimenting with different types of fasting to find what works best for you.Summary There are many different ways to practice fasting, which makes it easy to find a method that fits into just about any lifestyle. Experiment with different types to find what works best for you.Despite the long list of possible health benefits associated with fasting, it may not be right for everyone.If you suffer from diabetes or low blood sugar, fasting can lead to spikes and crashes in your blood sugar levels, which could be dangerous.It's best to talk to your doctor first if you have any underlying health conditions or are planning to fast for more than 24 hours.Additionally, fasting is not generally recommended without medical supervision for older adults, adolescents or people who are underweight.If you decide to try fasting, be sure to stay well-hydrated and fill your diet with nutrient-dense foods during your eating periods to maximize the potential health benefits.Additionally, if fasting for longer periods, try to minimize intense physical activity and get plenty of rest.Summary When fasting, be sure to stay hydrated, eat nutrient-dense foods and get plenty of rest. It's best to consult with your doctor before fasting if you have any underlying health conditions or are planning to fast for more than 24 hours.Fasting is a practice that has been associated with a wide array of potential health benefits, including weight loss, as well as improved blood sugar control, heart health, brain function and cancer prevention.From water fasting to intermittent fasting and calorie restriction, there are many different types of fasting that fit nearly every lifestyle.When coupled with a nutritious diet and healthy lifestyle, incorporating fasting into your routine could benefit your health.",https://t.co/KCeIc7LWVC,others
Healthy Metabolism for Optimal Fat Burning,"BasicsDiabetes is one of the most common concerns in the western world. Type 1 diabetes, which involves insulin deficiency, is usually diagnosed in adolescence, while type 2 diabetes is the most common form among the elderly.In diabetes, various factors such as obesity, inappropriate diet and genetic predisposition cause individual cells to fail to react to the body's blood sugar levels. As a result, the body's ability to absorb glucose from the blood is disrupted, and it is no longer able to supply its cells with this important nutrient. In the long term, resulting high blood sugar levels may also cause permanent damage to the vascular system and the organs.Diabetichron® can help maintain blood sugar levels within normal ranges to promote a healthy insulin response and healthy glucose metabolism. Diabetichron® was formulated according to the principles of chronobiology, to provide the correct nutrients at the optimal time of day for optimum efficacy and absorption. EffectsDiabetichron®, with its wide array of effective nutrients, helps support healthy glucose metabolism in a number of ways:Maintenance of blood sugar levels already within normal ranges: Extracts like that of the banaba leaf help facilitate the healthy flow of sugar from the bloodstream into cells. In combination with plant extracts of fenugreek, bitter melon and gymnema sylvestre, which act at an early stage to help reduce the absorption of sugar molecules from the intestines, the overall absorption of sugar is reduced and the utilization of sugar is optimized, resulting in maintenance of healthy blood sugar levels within normal ranges.Supporting optimal functioning of insulin receptors: To maintain healthy blood sugar levels, the sensitivity of insulin receptors must be maintained. Nutrients like vanadium sulfate have been shown to support the functional capacity of these important insulin docking sites. Furthermore, supplementing with chromium, particularly in its most active biological form, chromium polynicotinate, can help promote the effect of insulin once deposited at the receptor site. In combination, these nutrients support efficient and healthy functioning of the insulin receptors.Healthy fat-burning: Healthy utilization of blood sugar in the body is necessary for healthy fat metabolism and utilization. L-carnitine supports healthy fat metabolism, while enzymes like lipases, proteases and amylases help support better digestion and utilization of nutrients, processes which are also supported by extracts of fennel or other plants rich in bioflavonoids.Antioxidants: When blood sugar levels are not optimal, oxidative processes begin to produce large quantities of free radicals. Free radicals are the degenerative products of many metabolic processes and are highly reactive, causing general destruction of cells and tissue structures. For these reasons, adequate levels of antioxidants are an essential compliment for anyone desiring to maintain healthy blood sugar levels already within normal ranges.One of the most well-known antioxidants is alpha lipoic acid, which is frequently dubbed the ""universal antioxidant"" because of its ability to regenerate vitamin C and coenzyme Q10, two other important antioxidants.Alpha lipoic acid is produced in the liver and in other tissues, where it serves as a natural co-factor of multi-enzyme complexes like pyruvate dehydrogenase. Alpha lipoic acid plays an important role in the healthy generation of energy from glucose at a mitochondrial level. Alpha lipoic acid is also important for healthy nerve function. However, as you age, production decreases and the body becomes increasingly dependent on obtaining this valuable nutrient from the food you eat. Because the only food containing significant quantities of alpha lipoic acid is red meat, many people must supplement.Vitamin C, vitamin E and biotin (also known as vitamin B7) are three substances also known for their antioxidant effects. Biotin also plays a special role in supporting healthy metabolic processes, including the metabolism of fatty acids.Bilberries contain special pigments called anthocyanins, which also act as antioxidants. Bilberry extract provides anthocyanins to support healthy vision and help protect against eye conditions like age-related macular degeneration. Optimal pH balance: Coral calcium helps to maintain optimal pH levels, encouraging greater absorption and utilization of active ingredients. UsesDiabetichron® is a chronobiologically-formulated supplement created to help maintain blood sugar levels within normal ranges, while also supporting healthy glucose metabolism. The carefully-synchronized day and night formulas ensure the desired levels of each ingredient are delivered at the optimal time of day for ultimate efficacy and absorption.

Diabetes and Women,"Women with diabetes have more to manage. Stay on track by checking your blood sugar often, eating healthy food, and being active so you can be your healthiest and feel your best.How is diabetes different for women than it is for men? Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease (the most common diabetes complication) by about four times in women but only about two times in men, and women have worse outcomes after a heart attack. Women are also at higher risk of other diabetes-related complications such as blindness, kidney disease, and depression.Not only is diabetes different for women, it's different among women—African American, Hispanic/Latina, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander women are more likely to have diabetes than white women.How you manage diabetes may need to change over time depending on what's happening in your life. Here's what to expect and what you can do to stay on track.Yeast and Urinary Tract InfectionsMany women will get a vaginal yeast infection at some point, but women with diabetes are at higher risk especially if their blood sugar levels are high.More than 50% of women will get a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and your risk may be higher if you have diabetes. Causes include high blood sugar levels and poor circulation (which reduces your body's ability to fight infections). Also, some women have bladders that don't empty all the way because of diabetes, creating a perfect environment for bacteria to grow.What You Can Do: To prevent yeast infections and UTIs, keep your blood sugar levels as close to your target range as possible. Other ways to prevent UTIs: drink lots of water, wear cotton underwear, and urinate often instead of waiting until your bladder is full.You can't go wrong with the basics: check your blood sugar regularly, eat healthy food, and be active on most days.Make Friends With Your NumbersSometimes having high blood sugar can feel like a test you didn't pass. But numbers are just numbers. Think of them instead as information. Did a certain food or activity make your levels go up or down? Armed with that knowledge, you can make adjustments and get closer to your target range more often.Menstrual CycleChanges in hormone levels right before and during your period can make blood sugar levels hard to predict. You may also have longer or heavier periods, and food cravings can make managing diabetes harder. You may notice a pattern over time, or you may find that every period is different.What You Can Do: Check your blood sugar often and keep track of the results to see if there's a pattern. If you use insulin, you might need to take more in the days before your period. Talk to your doctor about changing your dosage if needed. Being active on most days, eating healthy food in the right amounts, and getting enough sleep can all help too.SexDiabetes can lower your interest in sex and your ability to enjoy it. For some women, vaginal dryness can make intercourse uncomfortable or even painful. Causes can include nerve damage, reduced blood flow, medications, and hormonal changes, including those during pregnancy or menopause.What You Can Do: Be sure to talk to your doctor if you're having any sexual issues. He or she can let you know your options, from using vaginal lubricants to doing exercises that can increase sexual response.Birth ControlIt's important to use birth control if you don't want to become pregnant or if you want to wait until your blood sugar levels are in your target range, since high blood sugar can cause problems during pregnancy for you and your baby. There are many types of birth control methods, including intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, injections, pills, patches, vaginal rings, and barrier methods like condoms and diaphragms. Choosing the right option for you will depend on whether you have any other medical conditions, current medicines you take, and other factors.What You Can Do: Talk with your doctor about all your birth control options and risks. Continue checking your blood sugar, track the results, and let your doctor know if your levels go up.Getting PregnantIf you know you want to have a baby, planning ahead is really important. Diabetes can make it harder to get pregnant, and high blood sugar can increase your risk for:Preeclampsia (high blood pressure)Delivery by cesarean section (C-section)Miscarriage or stillbirthA baby's organs form during the first 2 months of pregnancy, and high blood sugar during that time can cause birth defects. High blood sugar during pregnancy can also increase the chance that your baby could:Be born too earlyWeigh too much (making delivery harder)Have breathing problems or low blood sugar right after birthWhat You Can Do: Work with your health care team to get your blood sugar levels in your target range and establish good habits such as eating healthy and being active. Your blood sugar levels can change quickly, so check them often and adjust your food, activity, and medicine as needed with guidance from your doctor.During PregnancyGestational diabetes—high blood sugar during pregnancy—can develop in women who don't already have diabetes. It affects 2% to 10% of pregnancies in the United States every year. Any woman can have gestational diabetes, but some are at higher risk, including those who are overweight or have obesity, are more than 25 years old, or have a family history of type 2 diabetes. Careful management is important to ensure a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby.What You Can Do: If you're diagnosed with gestational diabetes, your doctor will work with you to create a treatment plan to help keep your blood sugar in your target range by eating healthy food in the right amounts and being active most days of the week. You may need diabetes medicine or insulin shots to keep you and your baby healthy.Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born. However, about 50% of women with gestational diabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes. It's important to get tested for diabetes 4 to 12 weeks after delivery and continue to get tested every 1 to 3 years to make sure your blood sugar levels are in a healthy range. Ask your doctor about participating in the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program, which includes a lifestyle change program scientifically proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at risk.MenopauseAfter menopause, your body makes less estrogen, which can cause unpredictable ups and downs in blood sugar. You may gain weight, which increases your need for insulin or other diabetes medicines. Hot flashes and night sweats may disrupt your sleep, making managing blood sugar harder. This is also a time when sexual problems can occur, such as vaginal dryness or nerve damage.What You Can Do: Ask your doctor about ways you can manage menopause symptoms. If your blood sugar levels have changed, you may need to change the dosage of any diabetes medicines you're taking. Heart disease risk goes up after menopause, so make heart-healthy choices that also help manage your diabetes, such as eating healthy food and being active.",https://t.co/XpUqEAMd9L,others
"Questions About Diet, Type 2 Diabetes, and Your Heart","1. What foods are both type 2 diabetes-friendly and good for cardiovascular health?The idea of a diet that's healthy for both diabetes and cardiovascular health can be overwhelming. The truth is, if your diabetes is under control and you're following a healthful diet, you're already lowering your risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). I recommend a simple, balanced plate-method approach to diabetes. Create a colorful meal with half of the plate full of seasonal non-starchy vegetables that are crisp and tender. Serve this with robust herbs and healthy fats such as olive oil, or my current favorite, avocado oil. Divide the other half of the plate evenly with a lean protein like baked salmon and a high-fiber, complex carbohydrate with lots of texture. Have a favorite fruit and keep your low-fat dairy as a small side dish or combine the two for an exciting dessert. 2. Are there any diets I should go on or any I should avoid?If you have type 2 diabetes and are at risk for heart disease, you should avoid the mindset that you need to go on a diet. This type of thinking has a negative connotation, and most diets eventually fail or naturally come to an end. Avoid any diet that isn't sustainable for a lifetime. Instead of thinking about foods you can't have anymore, focus on your end goals, which include stable blood sugar, a good cardiovascular report from your doctor, and taking charge of your health with a new vitality for life. I suggest that you regularly consume three balanced meals a day with one or two nutritious snacks to help maintain blood sugar control and to avoid complications of diabetes. If necessary, you should also make lifestyle changes, including stopping smoking and exercising regularly.3. It's difficult for me to lose weight. What should I do?Everyone comes in different shapes and sizes, and what is an attainable goal for one person may not be for another. Speak to your doctor, and if they recommend weight loss, start small and work your way up. Keeping a food journal is a great way to be mindful of what, how much, and why you're eating. There are some great printable food logs to keep on your fridge or apps you can download if you're more tech-savvy. One to two pounds of weight loss per week is realistic, if done correctly. Even a 5 to 10 percent reduction of initial body weight can produce significant measurable improvements in CVD risk factors in people who are overweight and obese with type 2 diabetes. If you have been unsuccessful with your weight loss goals, don't do it alone. Your doctor and dietitian are there to help. Food for thought: You don't have to be society's idea of ""thin"" to be healthy.4. Why is it so important to eat less carbs and sugar?Carbohydrates aren't the enemy but are a healthy and important part of a nutritious diet. However, if you have type 2 diabetes and consume many refined grains and sugary desserts and beverages, you should seriously consider changing your relationship with carbs. Choose complex carbohydrates that contain more fiber and a variety of vitamins and other nutrients. Fiber is beneficial to diabetes because it slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. This ultimately helps with blood glucose control.Break away from the cycle of consuming the same carbohydrates. Try something different like red beans over quinoa instead of white rice, or try a baked sweet potato loaded with chicken, veggies, and salsa. 5. What can I expect when I meet with a nutritionist?First and foremost, a nutritionist is there to help and support you. They aren't there to judge you on your appearance, diagnosis, or eating habits. I usually begin by thoroughly reviewing your medical history and listening to your needs and readiness for change. I'll work with you to educate you on the importance of controlling blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol. We'll work together to create an individualized plan, setting goals we both feel are attainable. Incorporating your favorite foods and restaurants is important for long-term success, and I'll schedule a follow-up appointment that corresponds with our plan. In many cases, I'll refer clients to a nutrition class for further education. My ultimate goal is to empower you to make better food choices and help you reach your personal health goals.6. How does a healthier diet affect not just my diabetes, but my overall health too? Diabetes increases your risk of dying from heart disease, so managing your blood glucose is crucial. Unmanaged diabetes can also lead to blindness, neuropathy, kidney failure, amputation, hearing impairment, skin conditions, and sleep apnea. That may be difficult to process, but the exciting news is that diabetes can be manageable. You can prevent these complications through healthy lifestyle choices, weight loss, and long-term blood glucose control. As a registered dietitian, even I follow the balanced plate method because I know it's a simple way to reduce my risk of developing diabetes and other diseases. You may even lower your risk for some cancers and reduce the risk of future bone loss through a healthy diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. 7. What are some key ingredients or phrases to look for on nutrition labels?Carefully reading food labels can help you on your quest to healthier living with type 2 diabetes. I recommend looking at the list of ingredients first. Choose foods with whole grains listed near the top. Avoid sugar and the word ""hydrogenated,"" which is an unhealthy trans fat. Then, look at the nutrition facts list. Read the total carbohydrates per serving and the serving size to determine if the food is a good choice for you. Assess the fiber content and aim for around 30 grams per day. Keep the calories, fat (especially saturated and trans fats), cholesterol, and sodium on the lower end. Be mindful that many prepackaged items will likely be high in sodium, which negatively affects heart health. Katherine Marengo is a clinical registered dietitian.

11 Reasons Why Berries Are Among the Healthiest Foods on Earth,"By Franziska Spritzler, RD, CDEBerries are among the healthiest foods you can eat.They're delicious, nutritious, and provide a number of impressive health benefits.Here are 11 good reasons to include berries in your diet. 1. Loaded With Antioxidants Berries contain antioxidants, which help keep free radicals under control.Free radicals are unstable molecules that are beneficial in small amounts but can damage your cells when their numbers get too high, causing oxidative stress (1).Berries are a great source of antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol. In addition to protecting your cells, these plant compounds may reduce disease risk (2, 3).One study showed that blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries have the highest antioxidant activity of commonly consumed fruits, next to pomegranates (4).In fact, several studies have confirmed that the antioxidants in berries may help reduce oxidative stress (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).One study in healthy men found that consuming a single, 10-ounce (300-gram) portion of blueberries helped protect their DNA against free radical damage (8).In another study in healthy people, eating 17 ounces (500 grams) of strawberry pulp every day for 30 days decreased a pro-oxidant marker by 38% (9).SummaryBerries are high in antioxidants like anthocyanins, which may protect your cells from free radical damage. 2. May Help Improve Blood Sugar and Insulin Response Berries may improve your blood sugar and insulin levels.Test-tube and human studies suggest that they may protect your cells from high blood sugar levels, help increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce blood sugar and insulin response to high-carb meals (10, 11, 12, 13).Importantly, these effects appear to occur in both healthy people and those with insulin resistance.In one study in healthy women, eating 5 ounces (150 grams) of puréed strawberries or mixed berries with bread led to a 24–26% reduction in insulin levels, compared to consuming the bread alone (13).Moreover, in a six-week study, obese people with insulin resistance who drank a blueberry smoothie twice per day experienced greater improvements in insulin sensitivity than those who consumed berry-free smoothies (14).SummaryBerries may improve blood sugar and insulin response when consumed with high-carb foods or included in smoothies. 3. High in Fiber Berries are a good source of fiber, including soluble fiber. Studies show that consuming soluble fiber slows down the movement of food through your digestive tract, leading to reduced hunger and increased feelings of fullness.This may decrease your calorie intake and make weight management easier (15, 16).What's more, fiber helps reduce the number of calories you absorb from mixed meals. One study found that doubling your fiber intake could make you absorb up to 130 fewer calories per day (17).In addition, the high fiber content of berries means that they're low in digestible or net carbs, which are calculated by subtracting fiber from total carbs.Here are the carb and fiber counts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of berries (18, 19, 20, 21):Raspberries: 11.9 grams of carbs, 6.5 of which are fiberBlackberries: 10.2 grams of carbs, 5.3 of which are fiberStrawberries: 7.7 grams of carbs, 2.0 of which are fiberBlueberries: 14.5 grams of carbs, 2.4 of which are fiberNote that a typical serving size for berries is 1 cup, which converts to about 4.4–5.3 ounces (125–150 grams) depending on the type.Because of their low net carb content, berries are a low-carb-friendly food.SummaryBerries contain fiber, which may increase feelings of fullness, as well as reduce appetite and the number of calories your body absorbs from mixed meals. 4. Provide Many Nutrients Berries are low in calories and extremely nutritious. In addition to being high in antioxidants, they also contain several vitamins and minerals.Berries, especially strawberries, are high in vitamin C. In fact, 1 cup (150 grams) of strawberries provides a whopping 150% of the RDI for vitamin C (20).With the exception of vitamin C, all berries are fairly similar in terms of their vitamin and mineral content.Below is the nutrition content of a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of blackberries (19):Calories: 43Vitamin C: 35% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)Manganese: 32% of the RDIVitamin K1: 25% of the RDICopper: 8% of the RDIFolate: 6% of the RDIThe calorie count for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of berries ranges from 32 for strawberries to 57 for blueberries, making berries some of the lowest-calorie fruits around (20, 21).SummaryBerries are low in calories yet rich in several vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C and manganese. 5. Help Fight Inflammation Berries have strong anti-inflammatory properties.Inflammation is your body's defense against infection or injury.However, modern lifestyles often lead to excessive, long-term inflammation due to increased stress, inadequate physical activity, and unhealthy food choices.This type of chronic inflammation is believed to contribute to conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity (22, 23, 24).Studies suggest that the antioxidants in berries may help lower inflammatory markers (25, 26, 27, 28).In one study in overweight people, those drinking a strawberry beverage with a high-carb, high-fat meal noticed a more significant decrease in certain inflammatory markers than the control group (28).SummaryBerries may help reduce inflammation and decrease your risk of heart disease and other health problems. 6. May Help Lower Cholesterol Levels Berries are a heart-healthy food.Black raspberries and strawberries have been shown to help lower cholesterol in people who are obese or have metabolic syndrome (29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34).In an 8-week study, adults with metabolic syndrome who consumed a beverage made from freeze-dried strawberries daily experienced an 11% drop in LDL (bad) cholesterol (31).What's more, berries may help prevent LDL cholesterol from becoming oxidized or damaged, which is believed to be a major risk factor for heart disease (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37).In a controlled study in obese people, those eating 1.5 ounces (50 grams) of freeze-dried blueberries for 8 weeks noticed a 28% reduction in their oxidized LDL levels (37).SummaryBerries have been shown to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and help protect it from becoming oxidized, which may reduce your risk of heart disease. 7. May Be Good for Your Skin Berries may help reduce skin wrinkling, as their antioxidants help control free radicals, one of the leading causes of skin damage that contributes to aging (38).Though research is limited, ellagic acid appears responsible for some of the skin-related benefits of berries.Test-tube and animal studies suggest that this antioxidant may protect skin by blocking the production of enzymes that break down collagen in sun-damaged skin (39, 40, 41).Collagen is a protein that is part of your skin's structure. It allows your skin to stretch and remain firm. When collagen is damaged, your skin may sag and develop wrinkles.In one study, applying ellagic acid to the skin of hairless mice exposed to ultraviolet light for eight weeks decreased inflammation and helped protect collagen from damage (41).SummaryBerries contain the antioxidant ellagic acid, which may help decrease wrinkling and other signs of skin aging related to sun exposure. 8. May Help Protect Against Cancer Several antioxidants in berries, including anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol, may reduce cancer risk (42, 43, 44).Specifically, animal and human studies suggest that berries may protect against cancer of the esophagus, mouth, breast, and colon (45, 46, 47, 48, 49).In a study in 20 people with colon cancer, eating 2 ounces (60 grams) of freeze-dried raspberries for 1–9 weeks improved tumor markers in some participants, though not all (49).Another test-tube study found that all types of strawberries had strong, protective effects on liver cancer cells, regardless of whether they were high or low in antioxidants (50).SummaryBerries have been shown to reduce markers associated with tumor growth in animals and people with several types of cancer. 9. Can Be Enjoyed on Nearly All Types of Diets Berries can be included in many kinds of diets.Though people on low-carb and ketogenic diets often avoid fruit, you can usually enjoy berries in moderation.For example, a half-cup serving of blackberries (70 grams) or raspberries (60 grams) contains less than 4 grams of digestible carbs (18, 19).Liberal amounts of berries can be incorporated into paleo, Mediterranean, vegetarian, and vegan diets.For people who want to lose weight, the few calories in berries make them ideal to include in meals, snacks, or desserts.Organic and wild berries are now widely available in many parts of the world. When they're not in season, frozen berries can be purchased and thawed as needed.The only people who need to avoid berries are those who require a low-fiber diet for certain digestive disorders, as well as individuals who are allergic to berries. Allergic reactions to strawberries are most common.SummaryBerries can be enjoyed on most diets, as they're low in calories and carbs and widely available fresh or frozen. 10. May Help Keep Your Arteries Healthy In addition to lowering cholesterol, berries provide other benefits for heart health, including improving the function of your arteries.The cells that line your blood vessels are called endothelial cells. They help control blood pressure, keep blood from clotting, and perform other important functions.Excessive inflammation can damage these cells, inhibiting proper function. This is referred to as endothelial dysfunction, a major risk factor for heart disease (51).Berries have been found to improve endothelial function in studies in healthy adults, individuals with metabolic syndrome, and people who smoke (29, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56).In a controlled study in 44 people with metabolic syndrome, those consuming a daily blueberry smoothie showed significant improvements in endothelial function, compared to the control group (56).Though fresh berries are considered healthiest, berries in processed form may still provide some heart-healthy benefits. Baked berry products are considered processed, whereas freeze-dried berries are not.One study found that although baking blueberries reduced their anthocyanin content, total antioxidant concentrations remained the same. Arterial function improved similarly in people who consumed baked or freeze-dried berries (57).SummaryBerries have been found to improve arterial function in several studies in healthy people, those with metabolic syndrome, and people who smoke. 11. Delicious Alone or in Healthy Recipes Berries are undeniably delicious. They make a wonderful snack or dessert, whether you use one type or a mix of two or more.Though they're naturally sweet and require no additional sweetener, adding a bit of heavy or whipped cream can transform them into a more elegant dessert.For breakfast, try berries topped with either plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or ricotta cheese, along with some chopped nuts.Another way to include berries in your diet is as part of a salad.To discover the nearly endless versatility of berries, browse the internet for healthy recipes.SummaryBerries are delicious when served alone, with cream, or in healthy recipes. The Bottom Line Berries taste great, are highly nutritious, and provide many health benefits, including for your heart and skin.By including them in your diet on a regular basis, you can improve your overall health in a very enjoyable way.

Sweet Potato Nutrition Facts,"Striking the balance between vibrant, versatile and delicious, sweet potatoes have become a pretty common component of the modern diet. From sweet potato fries to casseroles to pies and beyond, there are a myriad of ways to enjoy this tasty tuber. Still, many people have doubts when it comes to the sweet potato nutrition profile.This is because sweet potatoes are usually associated with regular potatoes, which are often served deep-fried, salted and in massive portions that are loaded with extra fat, sodium and calories. But are sweet potatoes bad for you? And if you're on a diet, are sweet potatoes fattening or weight loss-friendly? Keep reading to find out what you need to know about sweet potato nutrition and why you should include a serving or two in your diet.Sweet Potato Nutrition FactsSweet potatoes are high in many important nutrients. They contain a good amount of fiber as well as vitamin A, vitamin C, manganese and several other vitamins and minerals.One medium cooked sweet potato contains approximately: (1)103 calories23.6 grams carbohydrates2.3 grams protein0.2 gram fat3.8 grams dietary fiber21,907 international units vitamin A (438 percent DV)22.3 miligrams vitamin C (37 percent DV)0.6 milligram manganese (28 percent DV)0.3 milligram vitamin B6 (16 percent DV)541 milligrams potassium (15 percent DV)1 milligram pantothenic acid (10 percent DV)0.2 milligram copper (9 percent DV)1.7 milligrams niacin (8 percent DV)0.1 milligram thiamine (8 percent DV)30.8 milligrams magnesium (8 percent DV) In addition to the nutrients above, sweet potato nutrition also contains riboflavin, phosphorus, vitamin E, vitamin K, calcium and iron.Sweet Potato Nutrition: Sweet Potato BenefitsStabilizes Blood SugarHigh in AntioxidantsBoosts Brain FunctionEnhances ImmunityPromotes Vision HealthAids in Weight Loss1. Stabilizes Blood SugarSweet potatoes are an excellent dietary addition for those with diabetes as they have been shown to help reduce and regulate blood sugar levels. In fact, there are several studies focused on learning more about the connection between the sweet potato and diabetes. Caiapo, in particular, is a type of white sweet potato that has been studied extensively for its anti-diabetic properties.In one study out of the University of Vienna in Austria, 61 participants with diabetes were given either four grams of Caiapo or a placebo daily for three months. At the end of the study, the sweet potato group had significantly lower blood sugar levels than the control group. (2)Another small study published in the journal Metabolism showed that treating diabetic patients with Caiapo for six weeks helped improve insulin sensitivity. (3) Insulin is the hormone responsible for the transport of sugar from the blood to the tissues where it can be used as energy. Improvements in insulin sensitivity allow it to work more efficiently in the body to maintain normal blood sugar.Additionally, sweet potatoes are high in fiber, with each medium sweet potato fulfilling up to 15 percent of your fiber needs for the entire day. Fiber slows the absorption of sugar to help prevent spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels.2. High in AntioxidantsAntioxidants are compounds that help fight off harmful free radicals to reduce the risk of chronic disease and prevent damage to the cells. Antioxidants may protect against diabetes, heart disease and even cancer. (4) Besides being rich in fiber and many important vitamins and minerals, sweet potatoes are also loaded with these beneficial antioxidants.Orange-fleshed sweet potatoes are especially high in beta-carotene, which is the pigment responsible for their characteristic vibrant orange flesh. Beta-carotene is a powerful antioxidant that can help promote healthy vision, improve respiratory health and even protect your skin. (5, 6, 7)Studies show that colored sweet potatoes, in general, exhibit more potent activity against free radicals than white sweet potatoes with purple potatoes, specifically, containing the highest amount of antioxidants. (8)In addition to sweet potatoes, other top antioxidant foods include goji berries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pecans.3. Boosts Brain FunctionSome research has found that eating sweet potatoes could help boost brain function and improve memory thanks to their abundance of nutrients and antioxidants.One animal study out of Chungnam National University's College of Pharmacy in Korea, for instance, treated rats with purple sweet potato extract and found that it prevented oxidative damage in the brain, enhanced cognitive performance and improved memory. (9) Another animal study conducted in China in 2010 showed that purple sweet potato extract helped protect against brain aging and improved spatial learning and memory ability in mice. (10)Avocados, beets, broccoli and leafy green vegetables are examples of other brain foods that can help boost focus and memory.4. Enhances ImmunitySweet potato nutrition is jam-packed with vitamin A, with each medium potato cramming in about 438 percent of the daily vitamin A requirement. This vitamin plays a role in many aspects of health, but it is especially important in terms of immunity.Vitamin A helps stimulate the production of immune cells that fight off disease and infection. (11) It also can help kill off harmful cells and has been shown to have anti-tumor properties in some animal studies. (12) Many studies have even reported that vitamin A supplementation can help reduce the risk of death from infectious diseases in certain areas where vitamin A deficiency is common. (13)Getting enough vitamin A from foods like sweet potatoes is crucial to maintaining healthy immune function. Other top vitamin A foods include carrots, kale, spinach and apricots.5. Promotes Vision HealthIn addition to boosting immunity, vitamin A is also integral to maintaining healthy vision. A deficiency of vitamin A can result in symptoms like dry eyes, night blindness, a buildup of keratin on the conjunctiva and even total vision loss in severe cases.One medium sweet potato can meet and exceed your daily vitamin A needs. In fact, if you can squeeze even just one-fourth of a sweet potato into your diet, you're set for the entire day.Not only that, but sweet potatoes also contain important antioxidants that can contribute to vision health as well. Beta-carotene, for example, has been shown to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration, a condition that can result in vision loss.Other eye vitamins that you should incorporate into your diet include vitamin C, zinc and omega-3 fatty acids.6. Aids in Weight LossIf you have a few stubborn pounds that you're trying to lose, incorporating this nutritious root vegetable into your diet may be able to help. The sweet potato benefits weight loss because it's super nutrient-dense and loaded with fiber to help keep you full.Fiber moves slowly through the digestive tract, helping promote satiety and cut cravings to aid in weight loss. Just one cup of sweet potatoes boasts a whopping 6.6 grams of fiber, or up to 26 percent of what you need for the entire day.A recent 2017 animal study also found that purple sweet potatoes, in particular, may have extra weight-busting benefits. Mice were fed a high-fat diet and were supplemented with purple sweet potatoes, which were shown to reduce body weight and fat accumulation over a 12-week period. (14)Of course, sweet potatoes should be paired with a healthy diet and regular exercise to achieve maximum weight loss. Fortunately, not only do sweet potatoes aid in weight loss, but they can also help you achieve your fitness goals as well. Sweet potato benefits bodybuilding because it is slowly digested, providing you with long-lasting energy to fuel you through your gym session.Sweet Potato vs. YamsSweet potatoes are often referred to as yams, and for many, the terms are considered pretty much interchangeable. However, not only are they two entirely different plants, but there are some other major differences between yams vs sweet potatoes.First of all, the sweet potato belongs to the morning glory family of plants while yams — not to be confused with Mexican yams or wild yam — are actually related to lilies and grasses. Additionally, sweet potatoes are thought to have originated in Central and South America while yams are native to Africa and Asia.There are also some significant differences in the appearance of the yam vs. sweet potato as well. Sweet potatoes have tapered ends with smoother skin and can range in color from white to vibrant orange and purple. Yams, on the other hand, have rough skin and are typically white-fleshed and cylindrical. Yams are also more starchy and dry without the hint of sweetness found in sweet potatoes.Gram for gram, yam nutrition is higher in calories, carbohydrates and fiber but slightly lower in protein than sweet potatoes. Yams also contain a good amount of vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium and manganese but are not as nutrient-dense as sweet potatoes. Sweet Potato Nutrition vs. White Potato NutritionAlthough both have become common kitchen staples, there are some distinct differences between white potatoes and sweet potatoes. They both belong to different plant families, are notably different in terms of appearance and each has a unique taste that sets it apart. While white potatoes are often incorporated into savory dishes, sweet potatoes have a flavor that works for both desserts and main courses alike.But are sweet potatoes healthier than regular potatoes?Looking at the sweet potato vs. potato in terms of nutrition, each brings a different set of nutrients to the table. White potato nutrition, for example, is especially high in certain micronutrients like vitamin C, folate, vitamin B6, potassium and manganese, while sweet potatoes are significantly higher in vitamin A.Per 100 grams, there are 20.7 grams of carbs in sweet potato compared with 21.5 grams of carbs in regular potatoes. Meanwhile, the amount of sweet potato calories is slightly lower as well, with 94 calories in a potato compared to just 90 calories in sweet potato. Sweet potatoes are also slightly higher in fiber and have a lower glycemic index, meaning they don't cause the same sharp increase in blood sugar as regular potatoes.However, both can be healthy additions to the diet when used in moderation and with proper portion control. Preparation method is also key; potatoes are often deep-fried and doused in oil and salt, which depletes their nutritional value. Try them baked instead of fried and enjoy a few servings of both sweet potatoes and regular potatoes as part of a nutritious diet.Where to Find and How to Use Sweet PotatoesSweet potatoes are widely available at most grocery stores and typically found in the produce section, usually right alongside white potatoes. Special varieties, such as white or purple sweet potatoes, may be more difficult to find, however. Look for them at farmers markets or Asian specialty stores from September through April to take advantage of the purple and white sweet potato nutrition benefits.Once you get your hands on some sweet potatoes, there are plenty of ways to enjoy these delicious root vegetables. From simply enjoying a microwave sweet potato with minimal effort required to baking, roasting, sautéing or boiling your sweet potatoes, the possibilities are limitless. Sweet potato fries, soups and casseroles are some of the most popular ways to prepare sweet potatoes, but there are many other options available as well.Sweet Potato RecipesLooking for some unique new ways to incorporate this tasty tuber into your diet? Give these delicious sweet potato recipes a try:Sweet Potato Nutrition HistorySweet potatoes have been domesticated for thousands of years, and sweet potato remnants have been discovered in Peru dating all the way back to 8,000 B.C. It's believed that sweet potatoes were brought to Polynesia from South America around the year 700 A.D. From there, they spread across the globe from Hawaii to New Zealand to the Philippines and beyond.Today, sweet potatoes are prized around the world for their delicious taste and powerful health benefits. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, China is the biggest producer of sweet potatoes, followed by Uganda, Nigeria and Indonesia. (15)Sweet potatoes are especially popular in the United States, with North Carolina taking the lead in sweet potato production. Interestingly enough, however, sweet potato consumption in the U.S. has actually significantly declined in the last century. While the average American was eating about 29.5 pounds of sweet potato per year in 1920, average consumption today has plummeted down to just 4.1 pounds per year. (16)Precautions with Sweet Potato NutritionDespite the multitude of health benefits offered by this nutritious root vegetable, there are some people who may want to limit consumption or avoid eating sweet potatoes altogether.Although uncommon, sweet potatoes can cause an allergic reaction in some people. If you experience any food allergy symptoms after eating sweet potatoes, such as itchiness, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps or swelling, report to your doctor right away.If you have a history of calcium-oxalate kidney stones, you may want to limit your sweet potato intake. Sweet potatoes are high in oxalate, which can combine with calcium and lead to the development of kidney stones. (17)Finally, if you have diabetes, be sure to keep your sweet potato intake in moderation. While sweet potatoes are jam-packed with health benefits, they also contain carbohydrates that can raise blood sugar levels when eaten in excess. Pair with some non-starchy vegetables and a good source of protein to make a well-rounded, blood sugar-stabilizing meal and enjoy.Final Thoughts on Sweet Potato NutritionSweet potato nutrition is high in fiber, antioxidants, vitamin A, vitamin C, manganese and many other important micronutrients.Thanks to their impressive health profile, sweet potatoes have been associated with a long list of health benefits. Sweet potato benefits for men and women include improving eye health, enhancing immunity, boosting brain function, aiding in weight loss and regulating blood sugar.Although the terms ""yam"" and ""sweet potato"" are used interchangeably, there are many differences between the sweet potato vs yam in terms of taste, appearance and nutrition.There are also differences in sweet potato nutrition compared to white potatoes. Sweet potatoes are slightly lower in calories and carbs, are digested more slowly and contain a higher concentration of certain nutrients.Include sweet potatoes in moderation as part of a healthy diet to take advantage of their unique health benefits, versatility and delicious flavor.",https://t.co/cCXuVPi07h,others
10 Surprising Things That Can Spike Your Blood Sugar,"10 Surprising Things That Can Spike Your Blood SugarWhen you first found out you had diabetes, you tested your blood sugar often to understand how food, activity, stress, and illness could affect your blood sugar levels. By now, you've got it figured out for the most part. But then—bam! Something makes your blood sugar zoom up. You try to adjust it with food or activity or insulin, and it dips really low. You're on a rollercoaster no one with diabetes wants to ride.Knowledge is power! Look out for these surprising triggers that can send your blood sugar soaring:Sunburn—the pain causes stress, and stress increases blood sugar levels.Artificial sweeteners—more research needs to be done, but some studiesexternal icon show they can raise blood sugar.Coffee—even without sweetener. Some people's blood sugar is extra-sensitive to caffeine.Losing sleep—even just one night of too little sleep can make your body use insulin less efficiently.Skipping breakfast—going without that morning meal can increase blood sugar after both lunch and dinner.Time of day—blood sugar can be harder to control the later it gets.Dawn phenomenon—people have a surge in hormones early in the morning whether they have diabetes or not. For people with diabetes, blood sugar can spike.Dehydration—less water in your body means a higher blood sugar concentration.Nose spray—some have chemicals that trigger your liver to make more blood sugar.Gum disease—it's both a complication of diabetes and a blood sugar spiker.Watch out for other triggers that can make your blood sugar fall. For example, extreme heat can cause blood vessels to dilate, which makes insulin absorb more quickly and could lead to low blood sugar. If an activity or food or situation is new, be sure to check your blood sugar levels before and after to see how you respond.Find Out MoreCDC's Division of Diabetes TranslationTaking Care of Your DiabetesDiabetes Features &amp; SpotlightsCDC Diabetes on Facebook@CDCDiabetes on Twitter",https://t.co/PiG38RDq8U,others

healthy blood sugar level summit |,"Meet me and my vision for this summitHi, I am Desiree Arnold, ND, a graduate from the ""Joseph Angerer"" School for Alternative Medicine in Munich Germany in 1994, with over 20 years of experience in the fields of several Natural and Alternative Medical Therapies and Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Nutritional Coaching and Consulting for Chronic and Degenerative Diseases.My vision for this summit is to give people who are at risk for Type 2 Diabetes, and people who have Type 2 Diabetes, their caretakers and family members, an understanding of how Type 2 Diabetes can be prevented, and even reversed.My guests, who are Medical Doctors, Naturopathic Doctors, Practitioners, and Nutritionists will share their expertise on various topics and aspects of Type 2 Diabetes. They will share powerful knowledge that will lift you out of the fear and confusion zone, and give you tools and inspiration to take charge of your health and life. There are as well Super Heroes, who have returned to Healthy Blood Sugar Levels after conventional medicine's only solution was lifelong Medication and long term suffering from the threat of Heart Attack, Strokes, Blindness, and Amputations. And Guess What – They will share with you how they did it!I live in Trinidad and Tobago, where over 12 % of the population know they have Type 2 Diabetes. Unfortunately, there is an additional large number of people who don't even know that they are living with Type 2 Diabetes. Of them, many are women, who plan to get pregnant, have problems conceiving, and additionally give their unborn the inheritance of a challenged pancreas, with an increased risk to develop Diabetes in early childhood.Those who have been diagnosed, don't really know what it means to have Type 2 Diabetes and continue the same lifestyle now with medication, believing it is normal to be on dialysis after a few years, or having to give up toes or even a foot to amputation, go blind or suffer a stroke and heart attack. They are then driven by fear and hopelessness, losing all their health, wealth and quality of life, waiting for death.Having helped over 2 decades patients to understand Type 2 Diabetes, and coached them back to Healthy Blood Sugar Levels, seeing them living with hope and working on getting back their health and joy in life was wonderful, but it is not enough. while I was able to help a hand full of people, too many died, or are chronically ill, unable to live with purpose and enjoy life.In the summit, we also put a great focus on preventing Diabetes in Children, as Children born to Gestational Diabetes and to Type 2 Diabetic Mothers are at a much higher risk to also become diabetic at a very young age.The Healthy Blood Sugar Level Summit 2019 will bring you an understanding of Diabetes and will help you tackle the Cause by its Root, which is Nutrition. Therefor you will receive lots of tips and ideas of how to prepare and plan your meals, stay on a budget and work towards rebuilding your Insulin Sensitivity.My guests will also show you, how to prevent and in many cases reverse long term health risks of diabetes, like heart disease, stroke, amputations, kidney disease, blindness.Just imagine how great it would be, if you or your children can live a life of purpose and joy versus weekly doctor visits, fearing test results, slowing down the rotting effects of diabetes.The solution is right in front of you, and our mission is to help you to take charge of your health, take the driver seat in your life and say goodbye to chronic illness caused by imbalanced blood sugar levels.",https://t.co/Q5M9IImQl9,others
How an omelet balances blood sugar all day long,"Every morning, people across the country wake up and make a crucial decision with far-reaching consequences… what to eat for breakfast.Cereal. Bagels. Pastries. Toast. Bacon. Omelets. Pancakes. French toast. Smoothies. Oatmeal. Fruit. Nothing.These are just a few of your options. And — no pressure — but what you select can set the stage for how you feel the entire day.Especially if you're diabetic.Your breakfast can send you on the blood sugar equivalent of Magic Mountain, where you spend your day experiencing uncomfortable spikes and dips that leave you feeling weak, fatigued, irritable and just downright bad. Or it can send you on a smooth ride down the lazy river where you feel relaxed, even-tempered, satisfied, happy and ready to tackle whatever comes your way. The choice is up to you.If the second option sounds better to you, then I'd like to share the breakfast that's your ticket to a relaxing ride every day….Egg for breakfast keeps blood sugar and insulin in checkResearchers from the University of British Columbia recently uncovered the best breakfast for people with diabetes.They conducted a study on people with well-managed type 2 diabetes. One day, they fed study participants an omelet for breakfast. The next day, they fed them oatmeal and fruit. Study participants ate the same lunch and dinner both days.During those two days, study participants wore a continuous glucose monitor that measure glucose levels every five minutes. And guess what researchers noticed?The omelet prevented the usual blood sugar spike diabetics experience after breakfast. It also lowered blood sugar levels and improved the stability of blood sugar readings for the following 24 hours. Plus, study participants reported feeling less hungry throughout the day and having fewer sugar cravings on the day they ate the omelet.What made the omelet a better breakfast choice than oatmeal?Related: The health benefits of eggsThe fact that it's high-fat and low-carb. Researchers believe that eating a high-fat, low-carb meal for breakfast — even if you don't eat that way the rest of the day — could make a big difference in the blood sugar and health of people with and without diabetes.""The results of our study suggest potential benefits of altering macronutrient distribution throughout the day so that carbohydrates are restricted at breakfast with a balanced lunch and dinner rather than consuming an even distribution and moderate amount of carbohydrates throughout the day,"" said study author Jonathan Little, who teaches the University of British Columbia Okanagan's School of Health and Exercise Sciences.Low-carb is the key to breakfast if you're diabetic Now if you're diabetic, you may know that your biggest blood sugar spike happens in the morning. That's because people with type 2 diabetes tend to be more insulin resistant in the morning AND because the breakfast foods we eat in the Western world tend to high in carbs and sugar.But this study shows us an easy solution. Help your body out by giving it something low-carb in the morning, and you'll reap the benefits all day.Researchers went into the study expecting that limiting carbs to about 10 percent at breakfast would help curb the after-breakfast blood sugar spike. But they didn't realize that it would influence blood sugar control all day long. That's a bonus that you might as well benefit from.Those Magic Mountain blood sugar days are bad for your health, after all. They damage your blood vessels, eyes, and kidneys, among other things. So, stick to eggs in the morning… or something equally high-fat, low-carb.Editor's note: The truth is there are lots of proven and effective natural and alternative ways to turn type 2 diabetes around. And you can find them in Forbidden Secrets From Nature's Pharmacy to Reverse Diabetes and Blood Sugar Problems!

50 Best Foods for Diabetes,"For most of us, dialing back on sugar and simple carbs is an effective way to fast-track weight loss. But for those living with diabetes, it can be a matter of life and death.Diabetics are two to four times more likely than people without diabetes to die of heart disease or experience a life-threatening stroke, according to the American Heart Association. And for those who don't properly control their condition, the odds of health issues—which range from cardiovascular trouble to nerve damage and kidney disease—increases exponentially.Luckily there are plenty of delicious foods that are compatible with diabetes. We tapped registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators for their top food picks that are low-carb and low-sugar, but still high in flavor. These superfoods will keep your blood sugar in check without skimping on flavor. Bonus: Most of these foods are also packed with essential vitamins and antioxidants to fight off inflammation and keep your energy levels high. While you're stocking up your grocery cart with these staples, be sure to avoid the 75 Unhealthiest Foods on the Planet. ShutterstockThis nutty, trendy whole grain is a good source of fiber and protein, making it a smart pick for a diabetes diet, Sarah Koszyk, RDN tells us. ""With the fiber and protein combination found in quinoa, you'll feel fuller and have better blood sugar control. Protein also helps with the uptake of carbohydrates so the body can process them more easily. I suggest enjoying quinoa in a salad or casserole."" ShutterstockElizabeth Snyder, RD, LD, CDE says you can still eat carbs if you're diabetic. You just have to watch out for portion sizes: ""The trouble [with eating carbs as a diabetic] lies in eating more carbohydrates than we need, as the body will choose to store any extra energy as fat,"" she says. So, rather of cutting out carbs entirely, Snyder recommends switching to complex carbs, such as 100% whole wheat bread, which are higher in vitamins, minerals, and blood-sugar-managing fiber than their simple, refined counterparts. Shutterstock""Beans provide a notable combination of plant protein and soluble fiber that can help boost feelings of fullness and manage blood sugar levels,"" Jackie Newgent, RDN, culinary nutritionist, and author of The All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook explains. ""Replacing some meat with beans can play a helpful role in heart health,"" which is particularly important for diabetics as heart disease is one of the most common complications of diabetes. Consider adding kidney beans to soups and black beans to your casseroles to boost your intake of the legumes. ShutterstockLentils are rich in something called resistant starch: a type of carb that has a very minimal impact on your blood sugar levels because it passes through the body undigested and ultimately ends up feeding the healthy bacteria at the bottom of your digestive tract. So, not only will lentils help keep your blood sugar levels more even-keeled, they'll also help to improve your gut health.

Shutterstock""Salmon is a smart addition to anyone's eating plan, but for individuals with diabetes, it's especially beneficial,"" Lori Zanini, RD, CDE tells us. Here's why: ""It's a healthy protein source that will not raise blood sugar levels and will help to decrease the risk of heart disease and stroke—a major concern for diabetics."" Salmon's heart-healthy qualities come from its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. This particular fat reduces levels of triglycerides, a risk factor for coronary heart disease, according to a review in the journal Endocrine Practice. ShutterstockLooking for a protein-packed way to fuel your morning? Greek yogurt is the answer. ""It naturally contains both carbohydrates and protein, which is a perfect combination to help control hunger levels and blood sugars,"" says Koszyk. ""Plus, choosing Greek yogurt will give you more protein and fewer carbohydrates than regular yogurt, which can help better control blood-sugar levels. Enjoy yogurt in a smoothie or as a snack paired with some berries and chia seeds."" Shutterstock""Leafy greens, like spinach, are great non-starchy vegetable options because they contain lutein, an important nutrient for eye health. This nutrient is essential for people with diabetes since they have a higher risk for blindness than those without diabetes,"" explains Newgent. That's not all spinach has going for it. A study published in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine found that adults who consumed 4,069 milligrams of potassium per day had a 37 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to those who consumed only 1,793 milligrams. Just one cup of cooked spinach contains 839 milligrams of potassium (which is equivalent to what's in 2 medium bananas) or 20 percent of that target intake. ShutterstockCraving a treat? Consider berries your go-to when your sweet tooth strikes. ""Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries are all low on the glycemic index and are considered to be superfoods for diabetics,"" Koszyk explains. The combination of being low in sugar and high in fiber contributes to their diabetes-friendly ability to gradually raise blood sugars. An added bonus: according to two recent animal studies, consuming a diet rich in polyphenols—a naturally occurring chemical found abundantly in berries—can decrease the formation of fat cells by up to 73 percent! Shutterstock""Cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts and cabbage are high in something called sulforaphane,"" Miriam Jacobson, RD, CDN says. ""The compound helps reduce oxidative stress and vascular complications associated with diabetes like heart disease and neuropathy, a term used to describe a problem with the nerves."" ShutterstockAdd a satisfying crunch to your favorite oatmeal, salad, soup, or smoothie with the help of ground flaxseeds, a potent superfood for people with diabetes. ""Ground flaxseeds contain lignans (a plant-based chemical compound) and fiber which help maintain blood sugar levels and glycemic control,"" Koszyk explains. Shutterstock""I often recommend an ounce of almonds as a snack,"" Zanini tells us. ""Almonds don't raise blood sugar levels and are a great source of magnesium, a nutrient that improves insulin sensitivity."" Shutterstock""Chia seeds are a heart-healthy fat that contains fiber and omega-3s,"" Koszyk explains. ""Research suggests that chia seeds help control blood glucose. And it's all thanks to the fiber content slowing the passage of glucose into the blood. Also, fiber fills us up which reduces our appetite and helps us eat less."" Koszyk suggests enjoying chia seeds in yogurt, fruit and veggie smoothies, or salads. ShutterstockWhat's better than avocado toast? Perhaps it's the fact that this fatty fruit can help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels. ""Avocados contain a significant amount of healthful fats and dietary fiber, which help slow carbohydrate digestion and absorption and prevent spikes in blood sugar,"" Newgent tells us. ShutterstockIt's time to upgrade your cooking oil. Extra virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, which studies show can actually help lower levels of 'bad' LDL cholesterol. This is particularly important since diabetics have a higher risk of experiencing a heart attack or stroke. And get this: Snyder says losing just 7 percent of your body weight (if you're overweight) can result in significant health benefits for diabetics. Luckily for you, EVOO is rich in oleic acid, which a Journal of Lipid Research study found helps reduce lipogenesis, or fat formation. Shutterstock""When living with diabetes, eating a filling breakfast is an essential way to start the day,"" says Erin Spitzberg, MS, RDN, CDE, and author of Eat Like a Normal Person. ""Adding a little fat for added satiety can help,"" she explains. She recommends pairing up your favorite breakfast carb—either a slice of whole grain toast, bowl of steel-cut oats, or high-fiber cereal—with 1 tablespoon of natural peanut butter. ""The peanut butter adds approximately five grams of fat, which will help slow digestion and keep you full a little longer."" ShutterstockKale is called a superfood for good reason! Rich in fiber—with 16 grams, or over 60 percent of your daily recommended intake, of the digestion-slowing nutrient in just one cup—and low on the glycemic index, kale can help improve blood glucose control. ShutterstockDespite what you may think, nixing sugar or salt doesn't have to be synonymous with bland, cardboard-like dishes. ""So often, we think about what we can't eat when we start cutting out sugar. Instead, focus on ways to add more flavor to the foods you are eating,"" suggests Zanini. ""There are so many great ways to add flavor without adding sugar or salt."" Add a couple crushed cloves of garlic to your marinara sauce or saute broccoli in a blend of extra virgin olive oil, chopped garlic, and crushed red pepper flakes. ShutterstockA series of reviews printed in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition discovered that adding a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon to a starchy meal like overnight oats could help stabilize blood sugar, ward off insulin spikes, and decrease fasting blood sugar. Experts believe that the spice's powerful antioxidants, known as polyphenols, are at work; these active compounds have been proven to improve insulin sensitivity and, in turn, your body's ability to store fat and manage hunger cues. ShutterstockWant to continue munching on your favorite crackers without fretting too much over your blood sugar levels? Consider pairing the crunchy snack with a can of tuna. Depending on the amount of healthy fats and protein you pair with your carb-laden snack, your body can digest the carbs much slower than you could if you ate the carbs alone. In fact, Tufts University researchers recently presented the results of a study which found that eating protein- and fat-rich tuna fish with a slice of white bread produced a slower rise in blood sugar than when eating carbs alone. Sergey GavrikYour favorite grilled veggie is more than just a tasty side. Because asparagus is rich in folate—just four spears contain 89 micrograms of the nutrient, or roughly 22 percent of your recommended daily value—it's a great carb for those living with diabetes. According to a meta-analysis published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, folic acid supplementation can lower cardiovascular risk among patients with Type 2 diabetes by reducing homocysteine levels, an amino acid that's been linked to increased risk of mortality when present in high levels in diabetic patients. ShutterstockTrust us: it's worth the tears. A Canadian study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition discovered that a type of gut-healthy insoluble fiber found in onions, called oligofructose, can increase levels of ghrelin—a hormone that controls hunger—and lower levels of blood sugar. This allium can help diabetics in another way, as well. Thanks to their bioactive sulfur-containing compounds, onions can help lower cholesterol, ward off hardening of the arteries, and help maintain healthy blood pressure levels, according to a study published in the Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine.Pro tip: Eat your onions raw whenever you can for better benefits; a Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry study found the cholesterol-lowering properties were stronger in onions that were raw compared to those eaten cooked. Think: pico de gallo, sliced onions on sandwiches and burgers, or served in a Greek cucumber and tomato salad. Sergey GavrikIf you love spaghetti and meatballs, swapping in veggies for grains should be your go-to move. ""Zucchini noodles and spaghetti squash are both easy and delicious ways to lower the amount of carbohydrates in some of your favorite dishes,"" says Zanini. ShutterstockZanini is a huge fan of green tea—and with good reason. Because it is hydrating and filling, green tea can help prevent overeating, which will both stabilize blood sugar levels and aid weight loss efforts by boosting feelings of satiety. ""This drink also increases your metabolism and reduces fat storage,"" Zanini adds. Shutterstock""Oats contain a type of fiber called beta-glucan, which seems to have an anti-diabetic effect,"" explains Newgent. Specifically, a review published in Vascular Health and Risk Management concluded that beta-glucans help to reduce high blood sugar and blood pressure, adding, ""I advise people with diabetes to steer clear of added sugars by enjoying savory rather than sweet oatmeal."" Try making oatmeal overnight with one of our overnight oats recipes for weight loss. ShutterstockCheck out the power of the cauliflower. Grate it up, and cauliflower rice is a great low-carb substitute for refined white rice, which can help keep your blood sugar levels more stable. Plus, cauliflower is rich in sulforaphane: a compound which a Science Translational Medicine study found can inhibit glucose production in cells and improves glucose tolerance in rodents on high-fat or high-fructose diet. ShutterstockYou may not think much of broccoli sprouts when they pop up on your salad or sandwich, but these little guys are a powerful anti-inflammatory. They're packed with sulforaphane, which may help protect against cancer according to a study published in Cancer Prevention Research. Rich in fiber, broccoli sprouts are ""a potent detoxifier and play a role in decreasing cancer risk,"" says Nicole Anziani, MS, RD, CDN, CDE and Clinical Manager at Fit4D. Shutterstock""Edamame delivers a unique nutrition profile that could offer multiple benefits for those living with diabetes,"" Jenna Braddock, RDN, CSSD, sports dietitian and blogger at MakeHealthyEasy. ""First, the fiber content of one cup is a staggering 10 grams, which could be very helpful in regulating blood sugar spikes and also contributes to reducing risk for heart disease. Second, as a plant-based source of protein, it could help reduce disease risk factors when it replaces meat in the diet. Lastly, edamame is a good source of the essential nutrient choline, and research shows that 9 out of ten Americans don't get enough of in the diet. Choline is important for helping to reduce homocysteine levels in the blood, a marker connected to increased risk of heart disease and connected to vascular disease in diabetes."" ShutterstockInstead of reaching for pretzels, chips, or another high-carb, high-calorie snack, carrots make for a healthy, low-calorie alternative. They are packed with vitamins C, D, E, and K, and the antioxidant beta-carotene, and make for a good low-carb snack when dunked in hummus or guacamole. ShutterstockEggs are a great source of protein. Anziani recommends opting for pasture-raised, organic omega-3 eggs. ""The yolk will concentrate the omega-3 fed to the chickens,"" she says, adding that these eggs are ""a good source of choline and protein, but limit to under five per week."" ShutterstockInstead of choosing starchier veggies that can raise blood sugar, Anziani likes tomatoes to add to a salad or as a snack for a flavorful option that's low-calorie. They are also a good source of the antioxidant lycopene, which can help fight inflammation. ShutterstockThese fatty fish are some of the healthiest cold water fish, says Anziani. ""[Sardines are] extremely convenient to eat when packaged as boneless and skinless in extra virgin olive oil,"" she says. Pour them over a salad with the olive oil dressing for a boost of healthy fats and protein to keep your blood sugar stable. ShutterstockInstead of fattier cheese or mayo, Anziani recommends hummus as a dip for veggies or low-carb crackers. ""[Hummus] contains protein and a lot of taste for lower glycemic snacking,"" she says. ShutterstockAlthough vegetarians might have a tougher time getting protein in their diet, Anziani recommends organic tofu which absorbs the flavor of whatever it is cooked with. Another tofu option is tempeh, a fermented soy protein that can replace animal protein. However, those with a thyroid condition should only consume tofu or tempeh two to three times a week. ShutterstockAnziani says that although sweet potatoes are starchy, they're rich in beta-carotene, which is converted into the essential vitamin A. Sweet potatoes are also lower on the glycemic index than regular white potatoes. Treat sweet potatoes as your main starch for the meal and stick to a serving size—about ½ a cup baked or roasted. Keep the skin on for extra fiber. ShutterstockMCT oil, named for the medium-chain triglycerides, a type of fatty acids, has been praised for its brain-boosting benefits, but it can also be used in small amounts to replace other fat sources. ""MCT oil can be used in smoothies or drizzled over salads,"" Anziani says, ""It is tasteless and may be used as fuel preferentially, versus being stored as fat."" ShutterstockStock up on fresh pumpkin and pumpkin puree during the fall season. This super squash is rich in beta-carotene and adds a boost of seasonal flavor. ""Can be a nice addition to oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, or cooked as the starch component of dinner,"" Anziani says. ShutterstockWatching your blood sugar doesn't mean you have to give up dessert entirely. Dark chocolate that's 70% cacao or above can have health benefits without spiking blood sugar; just pay attention to the ingredients and nutrition label. ""One ounce or square can be consumed per day to strategically lower the stress hormone cortisol and keep milk chocolate cravings at bay,"" Anziani, says. Cacao is also rich in antioxidants, which can help fight inflammation. ShutterstockEven diabetics can enjoy pasta. Shirataki noodles are made from yam flour for a low-carb and super low-calorie option. ""These noodles have 0-20 calories per package and can be prepared in meals that would call for carby noodles,"" Anziani says. Shutterstock""All vegetables are good sources of nutrition but dark green leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, bok choy, mustard, and broccoli provide vitamins like A, C, E, K and folate as well as fiber, iron and several minerals like calcium,"" Byron Richard, MS RD CDE, Clinical Nutrition Manager UC San Diego Health, says, ""Leafy greens, as most non-starchy vegetables, have a low GI are low in calories and carbohydrates."" ShutterstockCelery is an alkaline food that makes for an easy snack; Anziani likes that celery is nearly calorie-free. Slice up some celery to dip in hummus or fill with almond or peanut butter. ShutterstockSmoothies, especially those with a lot of fruit, can have too much sugar for diabetics. But a good high-quality, low-sugar vegan protein powder can be an excellent meal replacement when shaken with unsweetened almond or coconut milk says Anziani. We like Vega One All-In-One Nutritional Shake Blend ($51.99 for large tun on Amazon). It clocks in at just 137 calories per scoop with 11 grams of carbs, 2 grams of sugar, 6 grams of fiber and 15 grams of protein. Blend a low-sugar smoothie with spinach, chia seeds, unsweetened almond milk, and a handful of berries for sweetness. ShutterstockBitter melons aren't all that common; after all, as the name suggests, they are very bitter, Anziani says. However, she adds that it has been proven to lower blood sugar. A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology found that 2,000 mg of bitter melon a day lowers blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. ShutterstockInstead of sodas and sweetened beverages, which can pack up to 40 grams of sugar per serving and can wreak havoc on blood sugar levels, Anziani recommends opting for unsweetened seltzer instead. Try a low-calorie flavored brand like Spindrift, or buy plain club soda or seltzer and flavor yourself with a squeeze of lemon, lime, or fresh mint sprigs. ShutterstockNuts are an excellent snack for diabetics since they are low in carbs, high in healthy fats, and high in fiber. Walnuts are one of the best nuts available because of their high omega-3 content Anziani says—one serving (about ¼ a cup) has almost 3 grams of omega-3s. Just be sure to stick to one serving size so as not to go overboard on calories. ShutterstockLike other beans, chickpeas are a high-fiber legume that can be eaten instead of animal protein, Anziani recommends. Roasted and seasoned chickpeas also make for a good high-fiber, low-carb snack compared to other high glycemic options such as pretzels and potato chips. ShutterstockInstead of other high-carb crackers, opt for high-fiber flax crackers. They're an excellent base for hummus, guacamole, or turkey slices. We like Mary's Gone Crackers Super Seed Crackers which are just 160 calories per serving and have 19 grams of carbs, 3 grams of fiber, 0 grams of sugar, and 3 grams of protein. ShutterstockBone broth is rich in collagen, which can make for a protein-packed and satiating snack. a low sodium protein-rich beverage rich in collagen Anziani says. Sip some warm broth for an afternoon snack to keep you satisfied until dinnertime. We like Pacific Foods for a tasty and affordable option. ShutterstockCombining lean proteins are key in keeping your blood sugar down while also leaving you feeling satisfied. Anziani recommends lean chicken because it's nearly pure protein, highly satiating, and versatile for a variety of recipes. ""A good portion of protein is a palm-sized piece at meals, or about 22 grams per meal,"" she says. ShutterstockYou don't have to give up rice entirely if you're diabetic. Anziani likes wild rice because it's high in fiber. She says it's an ancient grain that is actually a grass and is high in manganese, zinc, iron, and folate. ShutterstockRed, green, orange, and yellow bell peppers aren't just colorful additions to your salad; they can be a blood sugar-friendly snack all on their own. They have a sweeter taste without the sugar content of most fruit (about 3 grams of sugar per medium bell pepper). Anziani also likes how they are rich in vitamin C and also have a satisfying crunch. Slice them up and enjoy them as a snack with hummus or guacamole.

Diabetes type 2 exercise: Prevent high blood sugar symptoms with water aerobics sport,"Diabetes is a common condition that affects more than four million people in the UK, and 90 per cent of all cases are caused by type 2 diabetes. The condition could be caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or the body not reacting to insulin. You could lower your risk of diabetes symptoms by regularly doing exercise. One of the best exercises to avoid high blood sugar is water aerobics, it's been claimed.Diabetes patients could benefit by adding water aerobics to their workout routine, according to medical website Diabetes.co.uk.Water aerobics are a type of aerobic activity that raises the heart rate and makes you sweat. These types of exercises could also lower your risk diabetes complications, including heart disease and strokes.""People with diabetes are encouraged to exercise regularly for better blood sugar control and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases,"" said Diabetes.co.uk.""The reason for this is that muscles which are working use more glucose than those that are resting.""Muscle movement leads to greater sugar uptake by muscle cells and lower blood sugar levels. ""Aerobic activity at moderate intensity basically means exercising at a level that raises your heart rate and makes you sweat.""This includes a multitude of sports. For example, fast-paced walking, rowing, bike riding, and water aerobics.""Everyone should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week.But just because your heart rate is slightly raised, it doesn't mean to say it counts toward your 150 minutes, it warned.Certain household chores, including cutting the grass and cleaning your home aren't demanding enough on the body to count as good exercise.Many people may have diabetes without even knowing it, as the symptoms don't necessarily make you feel unwell.Common diabetes symptoms include passing more urine than normal, feeling very tired, and having cuts or wounds that take longer to heal than normal.Diagnosing the condition early is crucial, as diabetes raises the risk of heart disease and strokes.Speak to a doctor if you're worried about the symptoms of diabetes, or if you think you may be at risk.A quick blood test should be enough to reveal whether you have diabetes, or not.",https://t.co/92AhxetOdZ,others

A Trail of Clues to a New Diabetes Drug,"Last week I sat on an FDA panel as the lone Consumer Rep to discuss and vote on an application for a diabetes drug, semaglutide, from Novo Nordisk. This is a new entry in the category of GLP-1 agonists, 6 of which are already approved for use in diabetes.The benefits are clear and strong: semaglutide lowers glucose levels and helps patients drop weight by a significant level, 5 to 10 pounds on average. Lowering glucose levels is the surrogate marker that the FDA uses to measure the benefits of new diabetes drugs. The FDA allows surrogate markers because waiting to prove or disprove that a drug lengthens or improves lives of diabetics would take decades.However, the side effects are pretty bad. At least 20% of the trial participants had to drop out because they couldn't take the nausea, diarrhea and constipation. (This is a problem with other GLP-1 agonists, too.) These symptoms could lead to using drugs for side effects. At least one doctor on the panel voiced the obvious: With so much gastric distress, no wonder patients lost weight!The primary killer of diabetics is CVD (cardiovascular disease). The FDA looks closely at the effects of any diabetes drug on CVD, and for that reason, in addition to 5 other clinical trials, Novo Nordisk ran a 2-year trial called SUSTAIN 6 that focused just on CVD, with a secondary consideration on diabetic retinopathy — a problem that blinds half of all diabetics.SUSTAIN 6 had mixed results. Happily, it showed a significant decrease in most of the CVD measurements. Compared to placebo and to comparator drugs, those taking semaglutide had substantially lower rates of non-fatal MI (myocardial infarction, aka heart attack), non-fatal stroke, revascularization (needed surgery for bypass or other heart vascular issue), or hospitalization for an unstable angina (poor blood flow to heart). Unfortunately, data also showed semaglutide slightly increased the risk of being hospitalized for heart failure and had about the same risk (as compared to a placebo) of cardiac death. Deaths from all causes were about the same as with a placebo. On balance, the drops were significant and the increases small.'Early Worsening' of Diabetic Retinitis &amp; RetinopathyOf concern was that diabetic retinitis showed a definite increase among users of semaglutide compared to placebo. In tests of other GLP-1 agonist drugs, this same pattern had been shown and named ""Early Worsening."" In years 3 and 4 the rapid onset slowed, and soon the placebo group's retinitis symptoms increased well past the tested drug group. However, Novo Nordisk didn't continue the test to prove or disprove that this drug, semaglutide, would follow the same pattern.In addition, the quality of the research conducted on retinopathy wasn't good. The preferred tests for retinopathy were not conducted and the data collection was inconsistent. We can hope, but cannot assume, the rapid increase in retinopathy that semaglutide causes will level off. Therefore, the doctors on the panel agreed that retinitis progression at a rapid rate is a real possibility.The eye doctors on the panel discussed and assured the rest of us that there were many procedures for doctors to use to slow retinitis, and in their opinion this was a manageable problem. The greater concern to diabetics, they all agreed, was CV risk, where semaglutide showed a clear benefit.More Test-Subject Diversity Needed to Reflect At-Risk PopulationsThe above issues I had to leave to the experts. These doctors were trained in medical research and statistics. However, I know for a fact that the population upon which a drug is tested must reasonably compare to the population that will likely use the drug. Diabetes is much more common among the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations. Yet the trial participants were 80% white (with the exception of the 2 trials that were conducted in Japan).The appropriate patient population is just as important as correct dosing and timing. I was the first panelist to raise this question, and only one doctor added his concern to mine. He abstained from voting yes or no. I wish I'd thought of abstaining as an option. I voted yes, but I remain very worried. Here are my remarks to the committee (lightly edited for clarity):Semaglutide does show a lowering of glycemic levels and body weight. It doesn't seem to cause hypoglycemia as often as its comparator drugs. The committee has convinced me that retinopathy is manageable and that the lack of CV harm is a greater benefit. It has significant side effects and adverse events that cause a large percent of patients to stop using the drug.I am concerned about the race and ethnic makeup of the trial participants and the lack of subgroup analysis. Black non-Hispanics have the second-highest rate of diabetes, but are so underrepresented in these trials that the actual black patients number in the low 100s.The lack of significant subgroup analysis also concerns me. With such small samples it is impossible to know if it has differing effects and safety among women or ethnic groups.Considering the commonality of retinopathy with diabetes, it is surprising to me that the research was not gathered in a standardized method and which made it not of the best quality. The applicant seems to be depending on other studies of other drugs to conclude that the ""Early Worsening"" of retinopathy shown in their trials is temporary and that there will ultimately be a benefit to the patient. If semaglutide follows the pattern of other diabetes drugs, continuing the study for only one more year would have confirmed a pattern similar to other drugs. As it stands, the study stopped at 2 years, which doesn't allow any confirmation of benefit.The trial was particularly overwhelmingly white. Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of women, and it's very high on the list of cause of death for black people; diabetes has a higher incidence rate in blacks and Hispanics and they're not well represented.History has shown that drugs tested on only one ethnic group or one sex can sometimes have surprising, and detrimental effects on subgroups.The lack of ability to do subgroup analysis concerns me. I'm going to feel pretty bad if we don't go on record saying there should be more trial participants, and the trial should reflect the people who need the drug.I strongly recommend further study with better demographic representation that allows subgroup analysis to determine efficacy with blacks, Hispanics, women, etc.We also need further tracking to find out about the long-term effect on retinopathy.I think these further studies should be required, because the public has the right to full safety information.I thank the committee for the robust discussion that informed my decision.",https://t.co/cSkAjs3R6B,others
Lentils Nutrition: Good for the Gut or Digestion Disruptor?,"Why are lentils good for you? Lentils nutrition benefits include the ability to improve and maintain heart health, help you to lose weight in a healthy way, fight blood sugar fluctuations that can lead to diabetes or low energy levels, and improve digestive health, too.Lentils have been a staple of Middle Eastern and Indian cuisine for thousands of years. In fact, lentils go back to Neolithic times and are believed to be one of the oldest crops there is. Records show that in the Near East, lentils were eaten as far back as 6,000 to 13,000 years ago!Today, lentils are enjoyed all over the world in many types of recipes. They are one of the best all-natural meat substitutes and loved by vegetarians because they're a great protein food, are rich in nutrients and have a hearty, dense texture.Even though lentils nutrition benefits are so impressive, Americans typically don't eat anywhere near the amount of lentils, or other legumes for that matter, that many other countries do. For example, a survey done in 2002 and published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that only about 8 percent of adults eat beans, lentils or other legumes on any given day despite how readily available and nutritious they are.Aside from their high supply of nutrients, what's another benefit of including protein-packed lentils in your diet regularly? They're dirt cheap and very versatile. A big batch of dry lentils costs only dollars. That makes them a great, economic way to add a healthy source of essential minerals, protein and dietary fiber to many types of meals without needing to purchase expensive cuts of meat.Lentils Nutrition FactsLentils are considered a top ""functional food"" due to their high nutritive value, polyphenols, minerals, fiber and other bioactive compounds.One cup (approximately 198 grams) of cooked lentils has about:230 calories39.9 grams carbohydrates17.9 grams protein0.8 gram fat15.6 grams fiber358 micrograms folate (90 percent DV)1 milligram manganese (49 percent DV)6.6 milligrams iron (37 percent DV)356 milligrams phosphorus (36 percent DV)0.5 milligram copper (25 percent DV)0.3 milligram thiamine (22 percent DV)731 milligrams potassium (21 percent DV)0.4 milligram vitamin B6 (18 percent DV)71.3 milligram magnesium (18 percent DV)2.5 milligrams zinc (17 percent DV)1.3 milligrams pantothenic acid (13 percent DV)2.1 milligrams niacin (10 percent DV)0.1 milligram riboflavin (9 percent DV)5.5 micrograms selenium (8 percent DV)3 milligrams vitamin C (5 percent DV)Lentils nutrition also contains some vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin K, choline and calcium.As you can see from the lentil nutrition data above, lentils offer a wide range of important nutrients in just a one-cup serving, especially folate, manganese, iron and phosphorus. Many people actually miss out in some key minerals provided by lentils nutrition, resulting in a legitimate iron deficiency and magnesium deficiency. This is why eating lentils often is a great way to cover your bases and prevent deficiencies, especially if you're a vegan or vegetarian.What Are Lentils? Types of LentilsThe lentil (scientific name Lens culinaris) is a member of the legume plant family and considered an edible, flattened pulse. Lentils grow on a bushy annual plant that produces the edible, lens-shaped seeds within pods.Lentils are technically a type of biconvex seed since they grow in pods. They differ in size, shape and color. Some are large and flat, while the others are smaller and round. Are lentils a carbohydrate or a protein? They are actually a source of both, providing some plant-based protein and also some starch and fiber.Today, Canada, India, Turkey, Australia and the U.S. provide the world with the highest amounts of exported lentils. There are many different kinds of lentils available in markets, with colors ranging from brown to green, yellow and red. Lentils also vary in size and appearance, depending on factors like whether or not they've been hulled (or ""de-shelled"") and split. You can find lentils with or without their seed coats, whole or split. These processing techniques also affect how lentils should be cooked.Some of the most popular types of lentils include:Brown and green lentils are the most popular types in many countriesRed lentils/Egyptian lentils (usually split and have the most earthy flavor)Brown/Spanish pardina lentilsFrench green lentils/puy lentils (which have a dark, speckled, blue-green color)Black lentils (also called beluga lentils)Yellow lentils/tan lentils (which are red inside and mostly used in India to make dhal)Many other varieties (depending on the country)Top 7 Benefits of Lentils Nutrition1. Great Source of Filling FiberEating a high fiber diet that includes a variety of whole plant foods is one of the surest ways to fill up and benefit your whole body. Lentils nutrition contains both insoluble and soluble fiber. That means they make you full by expanding in the stomach and absorbing water. Additionally, their fiber can help improve heart, metabolic, digestive and immune function by carrying waste, excess fat and toxins out of the body.Some of the healthiest populations on Earth, such as those living in the blue zones like Italy and Greece where more people eat a typical Mediterranean diet, regularly eat lentils and experience better overall health benefits because of it.2. Helps Protect Heart HealthWhen it comes to heart health, studies show that lentils are one of the best high-fiber foods. In animal studies, they are beneficial for lowering cholesterol and preventing heart disease. A 2017 study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences found lentils to be rich in polyphenols. Several studies have demonstrated that the consumption of lentils is connected to reduced risk for chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, cancers and cardiovascular diseases.Researchers have found that diets high in lentils prevent hypertension and tend to produce more favorable cholesterol levels than diets lower in lentils. Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels reduces damage done to your arteries and prevents dangerous plaque buildup, which greatly lowers your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.Compared to other types of fatty or processed meats, lentils are also very low in both fat and sodium, other key factors that make up a heart-healthy diet. Diets lower in sodium favor healthy blood pressure levels, as do the many nutrients that lentils provide like folate, potassium and magnesium.Folate can help lower homocysteine levels, which is known to be a serious risk factor for heart disease, while magnesium and potassium help improve circulation and carry adequate oxygen and nutrients around the body.3. Can Improve Digestive HealthWith such high levels of dietary fiber, lentils should be on everyone's list in order to promote regular bowel movements. The high level of insoluble fiber found in lentils absorbs water in the digestive tract, swelling up and carrying waste out of the digestive tract.This makes lentils a great digestive regulator and helps potentially prevent constipation, symptoms associated with IBS, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis and even diarrhea. In order to get the most digestive benefits from lentils nutrition, drink plenty of water so the fiber you consume has plenty of fluid to absorb. 4. Helps Alkalize the Body and Balance Its pH LevelLentils are one of the most alkaline protein sources there is, which is important for balancing the body's pH level and promoting a healthy gut environment. When the digestive system becomes too acidic — from eating processed foods high in sugar or fried foods, for example — an imbalance in bacteria develops that can lead to numerous health problems.Lentils help combat the acidic environment of the gut and promote healthy bacterial growth. This is important for nutrient absorption and naturally preventing IBS, indigestion, constipation and many other diseases, too. Eating an alkalizing diet high in plant foods may help to lower the risk for problems like kidney stones, ulcers and bone loss.5. Helps Manage Blood Sugar LevelsResearch indicates that the high level of soluble fiber found in lentils traps glucose from carbohydrates and slows down digestion. This means lentils can help stabilize blood sugar levels. That is important for preventing energy dips, mood changes, and serious conditions like diabetes, insulin resistance or hypoglycemia.One of the keys attributes of lentils nutrition is the low starch content. Lentils contain only about 35 percent digestible starch, and the remaining 65 percent is classified as resistant starch, the type that essentially escapes digestion and absorption in the small intestines because a high level of lentils' carbohydrates and glucose cannot be digested in the body. They have a very low impact on blood sugar compared to refined grains and packaged carbohydrates.In one 2018 study, replacing half of participants' high-glycemic foods with lentils led to significant improvements in blood sugar management, sine lentils had a natural blood glucose -lowering effect. Another study found that various lentil foods prepared with different processing methods (boiling, pureeing, freezing, roasting, spray-drying) all had positive impacts on post-prandial blood glucose response compared to potato-based products.6. High Source of Plant-Based ProteinLentils are considered one of the best sources of plant-based protein. As a high-protein food, lentils contain about 18 grams of protein in every one-cup serving — the equivalent to eating about three whole eggs!They have the third-highest level of protein by weight of any legume or nut, coming just after soybeans and hemp seeds. Lentils can be used in place of meat in many recipes, whether you eat meat or not, in order to increase fiber and nutrient intake.They're an important source of protein for people who avoid eating animal products because in addition to just keeping someone from becoming protein-deficient, they also provide many minerals. Essential minerals typically found in meat, like iron and B vitamins, may be missing in a vegetarian diet and can lead to adrenal fatigue, mood changes and other symptoms.7. Can Help You Lose WeightWhy are lentils good for weight loss? With 15 grams of fiber in every one-cup serving of lentils, they're one of the most filling, ""stick-to-your-ribs"" foods there is. Lentils are low in calories but high in protein and fiber. This helps make you feel full so you're less likely to snack throughout the day or overeat.In fact, observational studies published in Advances in Nutrition show a correlation between high lentil (or pulse) consumption and a healthy body weight. Research consistently shows an inverse relationship between pulse consumption and a high BMI or risk for obesity.Another lentils nutrition benefit when it comes to weight loss? Lentils can help control food cravings for sugar and refined carbohydrates since they help balance your blood sugar levels. Using lentils in place of meat (especially low-quality or processed meats) can cut the amount of saturated fat from your diet while also supplying important nutrients.8. Improves Immunity and Gut HealthBesides preventing constipation, studies now show that dietary fiber is linked to improved immunity and digestive health. Diets high in fiber are correlated with lower instances of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis and various digestive disorders.The fiber present in lentils acts as a prebiotic that helps improve gut health and maintains a healthy microflora environment. This means your digestive system is less susceptible to oxidative damage and toxins, plus better at detoxifying the body and absorbing and using available nutrients from food.Research also shows that diets high in lentils can positively impact gut health, leading to positive changes like decreased body weight, percent body fat and plasma triacylglycerols. In one study conducted on rats, lentils positively altered intestinal colonization and reduced the presence of pathogens.In addition, lentils help prevent deficiencies in critical minerals like iron, folate, zinc and manganese that the body relies on to maintain a strong immune system.Lentil Nutrition in Traditional MedicineFor thousands of years, people have known that lentils are part of a healing diet. They are even considered to be one of the most important Bible foods, mentioned as one of the crops that should be used to make sprouted grain bread.Historically, people living in India, including those following a traditional Ayurvedic diet, have been some of the largest consumers of lentils. About a quarter of the worldwide production of lentils today comes from India, most of which is consumed there and never exported. Indian diets often include the staple dish called dhal or lentil curry, which is an ancient recipe and part of the everyday diet in India, eaten with both rice and roti. Lentils are also used to provide protein, make stock and thicken recipes.What are lentils used for in traditional systems of medicine? For vegetarians, beans, dhals and lentils are important sources of nutrition. They provide protein, complex carbohydrates, fiber and vitamins all year long, as they are shelf-stable. They are often combined with grains, vegetables, herbs and spices to increase fiber and antioxidant intake. This is important for reducing inflammation, digestive health, heart health, etc. According to Ayurvedic principles, here are some tips for cooking lentils to improve digestion and nutrient absorption:Eat well-cooked lentils, which are easier to break down.Add spices, such as cumin, black pepper, turmeric and ginger.Store dried lentils in airtight containers at room temperature. Try to use lentils within six months.Rinse several times before you cook. Ideally try soaking lentils to aid in the cooking process.Do not add salt or acidic ingredients like tomatoes or lemon juice until the lentils are cooked.Lentils vs. Beans. vs. Quinoa vs. ChickpeasWhat's the difference between lentils and beans and grains? All of these are technically ""seeds"" of various plants. Lentils and beans (such as black beans, red beans or white beans) are both considered legumes since they grow inside pods. Lentils are technically biconvex seeds, whereas beans are seeds that grow in long pods.Grains (wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, etc.) grow in grasses. All grains are small, hard, dry seeds that are available with or without an attached hull or fruit layer. Compared to beans/legumes, grains usually contain more carbs and typically less protein and fiber.""Beans"" include types like kidney beans, pink beans, pinto beans, red beans, pea beans, black beans, cannellini, chickpeas, navy beans, Great Northern beans, etc. Many beans are rich in complex carbohydrates, proteins, folate, iron and other nutrients, depending on the kind.While lentils are small, flat and disk-like in shape, beans are usually larger and oval- or kidney-shaped. Both are good sources of fiber, starch and protein, but both types are not considered ""complete proteins"" since they are missing certain amino acids.When we compare lentils nutrition to chickpeas nutrition (or garbanzo beans), we find that the two have roughly the same amount of calories. Chickpeas have a higher fat content (although they are still a low-fat food) and lower protein content. Chickpeas are also higher in sugar, while lentils are higher in fiber. Overall, chickpeas are a good source of manganese, copper, phosphorus, iron, zinc and folate.Which is better, lentils or quinoa? Quinoa is a fiber-rich whole grain (technically a seed) and a good source of protein, since it provides all nine essential amino acids. It's lower in fiber than lentils but has similar carbs and calories. Quinoa is also a good source of B vitamins, fiber, iron and calcium. Both lentils and quinoa are gluten-free and make great meat alternatives.Are lentils or rice better for you? Lentils nutrition is more impressive than rice nutrition because lentils contain more fiber, protein and many key nutrients. Combining the two is a good way to form a more complete source of protein.While lentils and other legumes/whole grains are high in nutrients like iron, magnesium, potassium and other nutrients, unfortunately these are the primary minerals that don't get absorbed due to high antinutrient levels.Lentils, like all other beans, grains and legumes, are best when soaked or sprouted. In addition to providing more absorbable nutrients, lentils are also easier to digest when soaked and sprouted, so if you have gas when eating legumes, you'll probably feel better after trying this method.Where to Find LentilsLentils are available in most grocery stores, health food stores, ""bulk bin"" markets and many ethnic markets (such as those that carry ingredients popular in Indian, African or Middle Eastern cuisine).The type of lentils you should buy depends on what you're using them for. Different types have varying consistencies and tastes. Lentils with husks/skins remain whole when cooked and are more hearty compared to lentils without husks, which tend to disintegrate into a thick purée. But since all types taste somewhat similar and provide roughly the same nutrients, you can easily sub one type out for another whenever need be.How to Cook Lentils + Lentil RecipesTips for Cooking Lentils:If you're wondering how to cook lentils, the good news is that they are very easy to cook from scratch when you purchase them dried. Of course, you can always buy them pre-cooked and canned, too, to save time and any hassle. Even canned or frozen lentils are very inexpensive and can usually be found in organic varieties too.Can you eat lentils raw? This is not a good idea, since raw lentils and legumes in general are very difficult to digest.If you buy canned lentils, check to make sure the can hasn't been made with BPA, a chemical commonly found in the lining of aluminum cans that's associated with heart disease, prostate cancer, abnormal reproductive development and other health concerns.Lentils take 10–40 minutes to cook from scratch depending on the exact kind you buy. Split lentils cook quicker than whole lentils, and hulled lentils cook quicker than lentils that still have their skins on. To cook dried lentils, rinse them well and discard any fragments floating around. Then bring them to a boil and simmer on low. Check the lentils after 10–20 minutes and keep simmering them until they're soft but still chewy.Dried lentils can also be sprouted by rinsing them well and then soaking them in water for about two to three days, changing the water every 24 hours. This positively changes lentils nutrition by increasing the amount of amino acids, vitamins and minerals that the body can actually absorb from lentils, since soaking and sprouting (or fermentation) reduces antinutrients.Lentil Recipes:Not sure what to do with lentils? You basically can't go wrong adding nutty, earthy-flavored lentils to salads, soups, stews, dips or spreads. They're also great used in place of chopped meat in things like veggie burgers, meatloaf or meatballs. Knowing about all of the benefits of lentils nutrition, today they're even used to make totally grain-free pasta that's very high in both protein and fiber.Here are ways to take advantage of lentils nutrition benefits:You can try replacing white beans with lentils in this recipe for Spicy Bean DipMaking preservative-free, homemade baby food using mashed lentilsAdding lentils to your favorite healthy soup recipesUsing lentils in time-saving crockpot recipesReplacing meat or other beans in things like tacos or hummusLentils History and FactsLentils are grown on an annual indigenous plant that is native to Western Asia and other parts of the world, including North America.Today, lentil recipes are popular throughout South Asia, the Mediterranean regions and West Asia. In most countries, they're combined with rice and/or other grains to make a ""complete protein,"" since together these have almost all of the essential amino acids that the body must acquire from food, since it can't produce them itself.One of the most popular lentil and rice dishes around the world originated in Western Asia and is called mujaddara or mejadra. Rice and lentils are also cooked together in khichdi, a popular dish in India and Pakistan. In Egypt, lentils are a staple food used in the national dish called kushari. Across Europe (especially in France and Italy), lentils are a popular legume used in many ways, such as added to soups or eaten with pork, chicken or beef.In other parts of the world, like Israel, Ethiopia and Iran, lentils have also provided a high percentage of nutrients to growing populations. In Jewish mourning tradition, lentils are prepared for mourners together with boiled eggs, because their round shape symbolizes the life cycle from birth to death.In Iran, lentils in the form of a stew poured over rice have provided protein and sustenance for centuries. Ethiopians have relied on lentils cooked into flatbreads or stews to provide calories, fiber and protein, especially for developing babies or when food has been scarce.Precautions and Concerns Regarding LentilsOne of the biggest issues surrounding all beans and legumes, including lentils, is that they naturally contain antinutrient factors, such as trypsin inhibitors, and a relatively high phytate content. Trypsin is an enzyme involved in digestion, and phytate reduces the bioavailability of dietary minerals.Another factor to consider when eating lentils is that they contain lectins, which can also disturb digestion and cause problems for some people like IBS. In moderate amounts, these shouldn't be an issue, but when someone has compromised digestion already, consumes large portions of lentils or replaces animal products with lentils and other legumes, she might start experiencing some digestive discomfort and nutrient deficiencies.As mentioned above, lentils and other legumes are best when soaked or sprouted. In addition to providing more absorbable nutrients, lentils are easier to digest this way and likely cause less gas.All in all, lentils are a great addition to a well-rounded diet, but be cautious if you follow a strictly plant-based diet. You want to keep an eye on your nutrient intake and consider supplementing with things like vitamin B12 and iron.Final Thoughts on Lentils NutritionThe lentil (Lens culinaris) is a member of the legume plant family and considered an edible, flattened pulse. Lentils are technically a type of biconvex seed since they grow in pods, making them similar — but also different — than beans.Lentils nutrition is a good source of polyphenols, folate, manganese, iron, copper, thiamine, phosphorus and more.Lentils nutrition benefits include providing fiber, protecting heart health, improving digestion, managing blood sugar levels, balancing the body's pH, supporting weight loss and boosting immunity/gut health.From the sound of it, you might think leaky gut only affects the digestive system,but in reality it can affect more.

Targeting Innovation.,"Targeting Innovation.Radically improving diabetes treatment efficiency.The fear of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a central challenge for people with diabetes.Diasome was founded and is led by a diverse collection of breakthrough thinkers and doers in both the science and business communities.Diasome's vision is to significantly reduce hypoglycemia risk by enabling every unit of insulin to better work with the body's normal metabolic system. This should make all insulins more effective and much safer.Hepatocytes' Unique RoleThe liver's hepatocytes are the only cells in the entire body that can both store sugar during a meal to prevent hyperglycemia and release sugar during the rest of the day to prevent hypoglycemia. But, hepatocytes will only function in this way if they receive insulin in the right amount at the right time. This is extremely difficult to achieve when insulin is injected under the skin because of the tendency of subcutaneous insulin to be taken up by muscle and fat cells before reaching the liver.Diasome's HDV SystemHDV is a globally-patented, Phase 2b-stage nano-sized liver cell targeting system that can be added very simply to any form of commercially available insulin. Diasome's Hepatocyte Directed Vesicles (HDV) liver targeting system is designed to minimize hypoglycemia by enabling the body's natural glucose metabolism mechanism, based in liver hepatocytes, to function more normally during insulin therapy. HDV enables more injected insulin to reach its target in the liver.Management TeamBoard of DirectorsPeople.Robert Geho CEOW. Blair Geho, MD, PhD Chief Scientific OfficerMarc S.

Cinnamon and Weight Loss - Plus 8 Cinnamon Health Benefits,"Adding some spice into your life could be just what the doctor ordered in terms of your health, and some spices really do have some great benefits. Take cinnamon for instance, a delicious aromatic spice known for its blood sugar regulating abilities, which in turn may help with weight control. Cinnamon bark comes from the genus cinnamomom tree and has an ability to help curb those unruly SUGAR cravings. Too much sugar can lead to weight gain – specifically dangerous belly fat!Different Types of CinnamonBefore we start, it is essential to understand some little known facts about cinnamon. There are actually 2 different types: Ceylon and Cassia; and although they both taste similar, they are very different in terms of health benefits.For Health Reasons, It is VERY IMPORTANT You Know the below Information About Cinnamon Before You Buy it!!!Good Cinnamon – CeylonCeylon cinnamon is the more expensive kind, but it also has the superior health benefits; it has a flaky bark (see pic). The problem is, most people who buy pre-ground cinnamon from the supermarket will more than likely be consuming the cassia type. Cassia often comes from China, is up to 10 times cheaper than ceylon, and may actually be BAD for you if you eat it regularly. I will explain why shortly.Most cinnamon labels do not disclose which type of cinnamon they use, and it often just comes under the umbrella term of cinnamon; but pretty much ALL pre-ground super market cinnamon will be this cheaper variety.The problem with Cassia cinnamonBad Cinnamon – CassiaThe issue with cassia cinnamon is although it does share some of the health properties of Ceylon, it is 1200 times higher in a substance called caumarin. This compound can be dangerous when ingested regularly (especially if you are going to start using cinnamon every day) and it can cause serious health problems, including liver and kidney damage.Luckily, most people don't use cinnamon in high enough amounts for this to be an issue, as it is often just used as an occasional spice in bakery. But if you are going to be using it a lot you should buy the flaky bark variety of cinnamon bark and not the hard curls (see pic), and just grind it up yourself. This really is the only way to know that you're getting the real deal unless you go to specialist herbal shops.Cinnamon and Weight Loss – Plus 8 Cinnamon Health Benefits1. WEIGHT LOSSCinnamon may help with weight loss – and I'm talking belly fat loss specifically here, because of the effect it has on blood glucose. When we a eat carbohydrates of any kind, which includes all things sweet – flours, grains, starchy vegetables, pulses and fruit then insulin is naturally released from the pancreas to mop those sugars up. From there they will pushed into your cells to either be used for energy, or STORED AS FAT.Sugar Addiction:-Most of us are petty hooked on both sugar and high GI carbohydrates, and may even be on a sugar addiction roller coaster that consists of eating high GI foods, having an insulin response, and then (if those sugars are not burnt off as energy, which mostly they're not) having them stored as fat.Cinnamon can help by decreasing the amount of glucose entering the blood after a meal by interfering with digestive enzymes, which in turn slows the breaking down of carbohydrates in the digestive system and therefore lowering a meal's GI… cool huh? What is a low GI diet?Cinnamon is a great addition to a weight loss program, however you should also be eating a low GI diet that is high in fibrous plant foods for not only better blood sugar control, but also because this type of diet contains lots of high antioxidant, anti aging superfoods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, pulses and also lots of fiber to keep the digestive tract in tip top condition.A slower release of sugar also means less hunger pangs!Now to the crux of the matter – the slower those sugars are released into the bloodstream, the slower and more sustained release of energy you will get. This will not only stop you from craving more sugar or carby foods again too quickly, but will also make you feel fuller for longer. And that's the point: stable blood sugar stops the cravings that make you gain weight, and cinnamon can play a role of helping to stabalise these blood sugars in the first place.2. IMPROVES INSULIN SENSITIVITYInsulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas to clear and transport sugars (carbohydrates) from the blood and into cells. The problem is, these days, many people are becoming insulin resistant due to this hormone's over use in their high sugar diets.Insulin resistance is one of the main hallmarks of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Cinnamon may actually reduce insulin resistance dramatically and it does this by helping insulin to function properly and lower blood sugar levels.3. ANTI DIABETESAs well as its powerful effects on insulin, cinnamon also lowers blood sugar in other ways by decreasing the amount of glucose to hit the bloodstream after you have eaten a meal.The insulin mimicking compound that cinnamon contains helps to vastly improve the uptake of glucose into cells (a good thing because insulin is a vital part of keeping blood sugar stable). Numerous studies have been conducted that now confirm cinnamon most certainly has anti diabetic properties, and at doses of 0.5-2 teaspoons a day can lower blood sugar levels by 10-29%.4. ANTI AGING All of the above benefits lead onto the amazing benefit of anti aging too! A low GI diet and better blood sugar control will keep you looking young, and that's an absolute FACT! All these sugar spikes and troughs actually accelerate the aging process, not just on the outside, but also on the inside too, meaning higher risks of many age related diseases.A low GI diet, and the blood sugar control that naturally comes along with it will help keep chronic inflammation to a minimum, in turn lowering your chances of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's and even some cancers. Given the fact that cinnamon in itself is a powerful anti inflammatory, adding it to a low GI diet will only enhance this effect.5. ANTI FUNGAL/BLOATINGCinnamon is a powerful anti fungal, anti microbial and anti bacterial; and is great in the treatment of fungal infections such as candida overgrowth. It can also inhibit certain bacteria like salmonella and listeria from growing. It is often used as a digestive aid to help eliminate gas and bloating; and is also great for alleviating IBS symptoms.6. ANTIOXIDANTSThe wonderful spice that is cinnamon, is actually higher in antioxidants than any other herb or spice. Antioxidants are an absolutely essential part of our diet because they mop up the free radical damage that is caused in our bodies by a continual toxic assault that comes from many sources such as junk foods, pollution, chemicals, pesticides, sun exposure, alcohol and nicotine. In fact, we are being bombarded from ALL angles by toxins every day, many of which we have no control over such as traffic pollution and aeroplane fuel.Free radicals are basically unpaired electrons that steal electrons from our own cells and thus causing damage to DNA. This damage then causes aging and disease, but eating high levels of antioxidant rich foods will help negate this damage and ultimately slow down the aging process.7. POSSIBLE ANTI CANCERIn studies on cinnamon's effect on cancer cells and tumor growth it was shown to have an antiproliferative action on cancer cells, thus helping to stop them from growing. A separate study on mice with colon cancer showed cinnamon had the ability to activate detoxifying enzymes in the colon, therefore having a protective effect against further growth. These same results were also was seen in test tube studies of human colon cells to activate a protective antioxidant response. We may not have conclusive proof in humans yet, but it certainly won't harm to sprinkle some cinnamon onto your morning porridge!8. MAY LOWER RISK OF HEART DISEASEThe biggest killer of our time is heart disease, and it is something we all simply must take preventative measures against which is where cinnamon could be of help alongside a healthy diet and exercise plan. When it comes to lowering risk of serious diseases such as this then no one thing will work, it needs to be a series of changes, and an all round healthy lifestyle needs to be adhered to.A recent study concluded that a dose of just 120 milligrams a day can reduce bad LDL cholesterol and trigylcerides, AND actually increase good HDL cholesterol.HOW TO USE CINNAMONCinnamon is a very versatile spice and can be used in all manner of ways, so you need never be stuck for ideas when it comes to knowing how to add this spice into your life. After you have sourced out your real ceylon cinnamon sticks (don't forget these are the FLAKY bark variety not the hard tubes) you can grind them up in either a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar and add to pretty much anything you fancy.Freshly ground cinnamon tastes just fabulous, and smells fresh and tangy. You can bake with it, sprinkle it on your cereal; or add to deserts, yogurts or hot drinks such as herbal teas or your bedtime milk.Go crazy with it and try new things, just be sure to get at least a teaspoon into your diet every day to reap all these awesome benefits.Thank you for your support of this website – I hope you have found the information you are looking for.

7 Great Low-Impact Exercises for Diabetics,"The right exercise program can help you live your best life with diabetes. It can regulate blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and even reduce the risk of long-term diabetes complications such as cardiovascular disease.But when you have diabetes, what's the right exercise program? Generally, it's a low-impact one, says James Borchers, MD, associate professor of clinical family medicine and director of sports medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. ""It's important for people with diabetes to get the benefits of exercise and yet prevent any injury and trauma that can occur with high-impact exercises like running and jumping.""After all, peripheral neuropathy — nerve damage in the extremities that can increase the risk of injuries and infections to the feet — develops within just 10 years in at least half of the people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, according to one January 2017 review in Diabetes Care. The same review also points out that peripheral neuropathy is in 10 to 15 percent of people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, making prevention strategies all the more important.Meanwhile, older adults with diabetes have plenty of extra considerations: cranky knees, sensitive hips, osteoporosis, and arthritis just to name a few. ""We really want to be careful that high-impact activities are not encouraging damage to already compromised tissues and structures,"" says Margaret Eckert-Norton, PhD, CDE, a registered nurse and an associate professor of nursing at St. Joseph's College in New York City.RELATED: The 4 Best Exercises for People With Diabetic NeuropathyProblem is, if you're one of those many people who equate exercise with running, crafting a diabetes-friendly workout routine can feel, well, challenging. Here are seven exercise ideas that minimize impact while maximizing your health.1. Walking Is a Gentle Exercise Great for People With Diabetes Despite looking pretty similar to running, walking actually involves a lot less impact, according to an April 2016 study in The Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research. That's because when walking, one foot is always on the ground — as opposed to running and jogging, which involve ""flight time"" when both feet are off the ground, Borchers says. And, chances are, you are doing some walking already.Increase your step count gradually from week to week by parking farther away from the supermarket door, getting in some walking treadmill workouts, pacing when you're on the phone, and taking short post-meal walks. A December 2016 study published in Diabetologia shows that in people with type 2 diabetes, a 10-minute walk after eating may regulate blood sugar levels better than exercising at other times of the day.2. Yoga and Tai Chi Can Help Increase Your FlexibilityThese gentle, meditative practices use your body weight to strengthen a wide range of muscles while improving flexibility, mobility, and — important for older adults and those with neuropathy — balance and stability, Eckert-Norton says.Before popping in a DVD and getting bendy in your living room, take an in-person introductory class for beginners. Talk to the instructor about your diabetes and any other health or joint concerns to get personalized advice and learn the proper flow for your body.RELATED: 6 Great Exercises for People With Type 2 Diabetes3. Indoor Cycling Is a Good Exercise for Anyone Prone to FallsEspecially great for people who are unstable on their feet, pedaling away on a stationary bicycle can increase strength and lean muscle mass throughout the lower body and improve cardiovascular health without risking falls, Borchers says.Start with workouts on a recumbent bike, then move to upright ones and, as you and your doctor feel comfortable, try experimenting with indoor cycling classes. These classes intersperse periods of intense aerobic effort with rest to help you get more benefits in less time. However, it's important to talk to your doctor before trying out any indoor cycling class to make sure that your heart is healthy enough for high-intensity exercise.4. Pool Workouts Are Joint-Friendly Due to Their Lack of ImpactThe ultimate ""gentle"" exercise, in-the-water workouts such as swimming and water aerobics are not only zero impact, they are non-weight-bearing, removing the effects of gravity on your joints, Borchers says. In a March 2016 study in the The Journal of Rheumatology, researchers studied middle-aged and older adults with osteoarthritis, and found that pool workouts significantly reduced their joint pain and stiffness while boosting their muscle strength and functionality.Many gyms and community centers have indoor swimming pools for year-round water workouts, so check out what options are available near you. If you're new to swimming, try taking a class to learn the basics so that you can enter the water safely and with confidence.RELATED: Why You Should Consider Adding Weight Training to Your Diabetes Exercise Routine5. Elliptical, Stair-Climber, and Rower Training Are Low-Impact Cardio OptionsThe American Diabetes Association recommends performing at least 30 minutes of low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise five times per week. Ellipticals, stair-climbers, and rowers are all great ways to get that cardio in, and with minimal impact. Ellipticals and stair-climbers are ideal for people who are comfortable having all of their weight over one foot at a time, while rowers train both the lower and upper body at once, Borchers says.6. Weight-Bearing Strength Training Exercises Can Help With Blood Sugar ControlStanding (aka weight-bearing) strength training workouts strengthen your bones to help prevent diabetes-related joint and bone issues while boosting lean muscle mass and strength, according to the National Institutes of Health. ""The more lean body mass you have, the more glucose uptake and the better blood sugar control you will have,"" Eckert-Norton says. Plus, a March 2017 study in Nutrition &amp; Metabolism shows that strength training directly combats many of the metabolic changes that occur in muscles with type 2 diabetes.When beginning a strength routine, it's important to take the time to master proper form, Borchers says. If you don't know technique (and even if you think you do!), consider scheduling a few sessions with a certified trainer near you who has experience working with people with diabetes.RELATED: How Weight Loss May Put Type 2 Diabetes in Remission7. Chair Exercises Are a Convenient Way to Help Boost Your StabilityBreak a sweat without leaving the couch. For anyone who has mobility and stability issues (or just wants to work out while watching TV), seated strength-training exercises are a great option for strengthening the upper and even lower body. ""In most people who have neuropathy problems in the feet, the hands are still quite functional,"" Eckert-Norton says. That makes shoulder presses, bicep curls, and other lifting exercises very doable.To strengthen the legs from the seated position, try heel and toe taps, seated marches, and banded hip abductions.",https://t.co/TxpNtTv6HZ,others

Juice Plus+ Information for Diabetics,"Juice Plus+ Information for DiabeticsDiabetes is epidemic, tracking the rampant increase in obesity. It's severely impacting adults, but even worse, our children. ""This generation of children has a shorter life expectancy than their parents."" says Dr. David Katz, Yale University.While Juice Plus+ is not intended to prevent, treat or cure any disease, ""there is no single disease or condition that cannot be helped by good nutrition"", says Dr. Paul Williams, Emergency Medicine. So, we offer below some information from medical experts who use Juice Plus+ with their diabetic patients, because these people are often trapped between a desperate need for fresh produce in their diet, and severe restrictions presented by their diabetic diet.Shirley J. Robertson, MD, is in Family Practice inEast Lansing, MI, and offers this information:""Juice Plus+ and diabetics make a great combination because most diabetics can't eat enough fruits and vegetables for good health due to the calorie content, especially of fruits. Most diabetic diets limit fruit to two to three per day and vegetables in the green, leafy variety to three per day. Other vegetables such as potatoes, corn and squash are placed into the starch category. Juice Plus+ makes a great dietary supplement for diabetics because the capsules have virtually no salt, sugar or starch. All these ingredients are removed in the drying process before the remaining nutrients are powdered from the raw fruits and vegetables. Therefore, you get the anti-oxidation benefits of 17 raw, fresh fruits and vegetables without the calorie intake of those same foods. Diabetics, however, still need to eat right and exercise as well. The nutrients from Juice Plus+ are in the form of antioxidants, phytochemicals, food enzymes, vitamins and minerals that are generally found in the skin or outer layer of plants that we mostly peel away in normal food processing. These nutrients help digest our food and actually slow the absorption of nutrients in the gut or gastrointestinal tract. Thus, blood sugar swings are fewer and absorption is improved after eating breakfast with the Orchard Blend capsules and dinner with the Garden Blend capsules. Antioxidants help normal body metabolism. The most common ones we know about are Vitamin C and Vitamin E; yet thousands of other antioxidants are needed for normal body metabolism. Vitamin C and Vitamin E can be unbalanced by artificially overdosing these same helpful vitamins by taking standard multiple vitamins, leading to kidney stones in the case of too much Vitamin C and worsening of certain tumors in the case of Vitamin E. Juice Plus+ avoids these problems because it is whole food, which contains the natural balance of the food we normally would eat if we juiced 17 different fruits and vegetables each day. Another Juice Plus+ product is also safe for diabetics. Juice Plus+ Complete has calories, but is balanced with fruit and vegetable powders, along with a balance of grains and fats from vegetables resembling the recommended food pyramid: mostly grains, a balance of fruit and vegetables, some soy protein and a little fat. Juice Plus+ Complete can be mixed with water, if calories are a problem, or with soymilk, fruit juice or regular milk, depending on preference or which meal is being replaced or supplemented. In short, there are no harmful effects on diabetics from the Juice Plus+ line of products, yet many helpful benefits.""Dr. Peter Lodewick, MD is a practicing physician specializing in diabetes care, and a diabetic himself. He has served as president of theAlabama affiliate of the American Diabetes Association and has served on numerous diabetes editorial boards. In his book ""A Diabetic Doctor Looks at Diabetes"" Dr. Lodewick comments: ""If people are not able to consume enough fresh fruits and vegetables -- I, for one, am one of these people as my sugar may go up if I eat too many fruits and juices ... Knowing the protective health benefits of fresh fruits and vegetables, I began using a product called ""Juice Plus+"". Since using this product, I have felt much more energetic, despite working very long hours, sometimes with minimal sleep. There must be nutrients in the product that I was not getting in my diet. The product is made by a process called 'flash drying', which prevents heating and freezing from destroying the nutrients that may otherwise occur when fruits and vegetables are frozen or heated. There are seventeen different fresh fruits and vegetables in the product … to make just one day's supply.""In another book, ""The Diabetic Man"", Dr. Lodewick also says: ""...getting the needed fruits and vegetables may be a chore without it adversely affecting weight loss plans and blood sugars. In searching for an answer to this dilemma, I have become familiar with a product called Juice Plus+ ... It contains natural components of fresh fruits and vegetables in easy-to-digest capsules. There may be extracts of up to four pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables contained in a day's supply. Studies indicate that the bioavailability of the vitamins, minerals, enzymes and plant nutrients in these capsules may be more than would be available by consuming five to ten fresh raw fruits and vegetables a day. I have been using Juice Plus+ for the past 3-1/2 years, primarily to prevent arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and, in my own case, it has made me feel better and has given me more energy than I was getting from my routine diet. I have seen the same response in many of my patients; some have noted relief of pain, more energy, less fatigue, lower sugars, improving cholesterol and blood fat.""Wendy Boltz, a Type 1 diabetic, diagnosed at age 11, says: ""Over the last 26 years, I have learned to manage my diabetes to the best of my ability but it is tricky. Two years ago I was at a very discouraging place in my life, doing my best to exercise, watch my nutrition and take vitamins, but my body was deteriorating at a rapid pace. I hardly had any energy, and got sick whenever I was exposed to anything. I began getting recurring bladder infections, and eventually had a very severe kidney infection. It was at this low point that I started taking the Juice Plus+ capsules, and my health started to be rebuilt. After a few weeks, my energy started to improve, my nails started to grow and my hair was thicker. More importantly, my infections did not return, and I figured that the external changes were probably indicative of internal changes. After a few months, I began using the Juice Plus+ Complete, along with the capsules. This provided a great boost in my energy level and blood sugar control. As I have continued on the products, the good results keep getting better. My blood sugar has definitely stabilized and been easier to keep within ""normal"" range. My energy level is very high (which, as you are probably aware, is a problem for most diabetics) and I also credit Juice Plus+ Complete for that. I drink it every morning and wouldn't be without it. Also, my immune system is great, and I haven't had a cold or flu in about 18 months. I have been on Juice Plus+ for almost 2 years, and everything about my body gets healthier all the time. In fact, I just received a great report from my dentist about my teeth and gums. The hygienist said she had never seen such healthy tissue on a diabetic before. I truly believe that every diabetic should avail themselves of the excellent nutrition and protection that Juice Plus+ has to offer. If it can rebuild my health from such a hopeless place, I know it can help others in a similar situation and can do even more for people who use the products right from the start.""Bottom Line: diabetics need Juice Plus+, and so do non-diabetics. Juice Plus+ is the most thoroughly researchednutritional product in history, shown to: ~ be bio-available (it gets into our blood) ~ significantly increase antioxidants in your body ~ significantly reduce free radicals (oxidative stress) ~ protect and help repair DNA ~ enhance the immune system ~ improve circulation ~ improve heart health ~ improve skin health ~ improve gum health ~ reduce symptoms of the common cold ~ reduce systemic inflammation ~ improve athletic recovery and performance",https://t.co/taBd53NlmD,others
Type 2 diabetes: Lower your blood sugar by adding more of this bean to your diet,"Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by making lifestyle changes, including improving your diet. As well as cutting down on sugar and other unhealthy foods, adding more of other foods into your diet may also help to manage blood sugar levels. According to dietitian Juliette Kellow, one type of food that is beneficial to people with diabetes is pulses. Pulses are the dried seeds of legume plants, such as beans, chickpeas, lentils and dried peas, and kidney beans could be of particular significance.""Kidney beans are the star of the pulse world for their high fibre content, which is important for weight management and those with type 2 diabetes, plus they're rich in antioxidants,"" said Kellow.Although kidney beans are a standout performer, all types of pulses have benefits which may help to improve blood sugar levels, notes the dietitian. In one study, it was found regularly consuming large portions of pulses improved blood sugar control, making them ideal for people with type 2 diabetes.The study involved participants eating 200g, or 7oz, portions of pulses five times a week.Another large study found women who ate the highest, compared with the lowest, amounts of pulses reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by nearly a quarter. Other types of beans which fall into the pulses family include haricot beans, black-eyed beans and black beans.Kellow advises all people to include pulses in their diets, whether they have diabetes or not.Studies show a daily serving of 80g, or 3oz, of pulses offer the best health benefits, and the dietitian recommends choosing a variety of pulses to ensure a range of nutrients.All beans are nutrient rich, but canned varieties are a little less so than dried versions. If using canned pulses, choose those in water without added sugar or salt.""Good intakes of pulses are linked to a host of health benefits, reducing the risk of many age-related problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes,"" said Kellow.""They're also a great weight-loss food, and an excellent source of nutrients for all.""Type 2 diabetes happens in people whose bodies don't produce enough insulin, or the insulin produced is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to control the level of sugar in the blood and transfer it to the cells to be turned into energy.If insulin is unable to do this, too much sugar will remain in the blood, which can lead to serious health complications with the heart, kidneys, nerves, eyes and feet.As well as improving your diet, type 2 diabetes can be managed by exercising regularly, not smoking and limiting alcohol intake.Weight management is important for people with type 2 diabetes as people who are overweight are more likely to develop the condition and also more likely to suffer from the associated complications.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.",https://t.co/ZCd7dTWESZ,others
7 Great Low-Impact Exercises for Diabetics,"The right exercise program can help you live your best life with diabetes. It can regulate blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and even reduce the risk of long-term diabetes complications such as cardiovascular disease.But when you have diabetes, what's the right exercise program? Generally, it's a low-impact one, says James Borchers, MD, associate professor of clinical family medicine and director of sports medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. ""It's important for people with diabetes to get the benefits of exercise and yet prevent any injury and trauma that can occur with high-impact exercises like running and jumping.""After all, peripheral neuropathy — nerve damage in the extremities that can increase the risk of injuries and infections to the feet — develops within just 10 years in at least half of the people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, according to one January 2017 review in Diabetes Care. The same review also points out that peripheral neuropathy is in 10 to 15 percent of people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, making prevention strategies all the more important.Meanwhile, older adults with diabetes have plenty of extra considerations: cranky knees, sensitive hips, osteoporosis, and arthritis just to name a few. ""We really want to be careful that high-impact activities are not encouraging damage to already compromised tissues and structures,"" says Margaret Eckert-Norton, PhD, CDE, a registered nurse and an associate professor of nursing at St. Joseph's College in New York City.RELATED: The 4 Best Exercises for People With Diabetic NeuropathyProblem is, if you're one of those many people who equate exercise with running, crafting a diabetes-friendly workout routine can feel, well, challenging. Here are seven exercise ideas that minimize impact while maximizing your health.1. Walking Is a Gentle Exercise Great for People With Diabetes Despite looking pretty similar to running, walking actually involves a lot less impact, according to an April 2016 study in The Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research. That's because when walking, one foot is always on the ground — as opposed to running and jogging, which involve ""flight time"" when both feet are off the ground, Borchers says. And, chances are, you are doing some walking already.Increase your step count gradually from week to week by parking farther away from the supermarket door, getting in some walking treadmill workouts, pacing when you're on the phone, and taking short post-meal walks. A December 2016 study published in Diabetologia shows that in people with type 2 diabetes, a 10-minute walk after eating may regulate blood sugar levels better than exercising at other times of the day.2. Yoga and Tai Chi Can Help Increase Your FlexibilityThese gentle, meditative practices use your body weight to strengthen a wide range of muscles while improving flexibility, mobility, and — important for older adults and those with neuropathy — balance and stability, Eckert-Norton says.Before popping in a DVD and getting bendy in your living room, take an in-person introductory class for beginners. Talk to the instructor about your diabetes and any other health or joint concerns to get personalized advice and learn the proper flow for your body.RELATED: 6 Great Exercises for People With Type 2 Diabetes3. Indoor Cycling Is a Good Exercise for Anyone Prone to FallsEspecially great for people who are unstable on their feet, pedaling away on a stationary bicycle can increase strength and lean muscle mass throughout the lower body and improve cardiovascular health without risking falls, Borchers says.Start with workouts on a recumbent bike, then move to upright ones and, as you and your doctor feel comfortable, try experimenting with indoor cycling classes. These classes intersperse periods of intense aerobic effort with rest to help you get more benefits in less time. However, it's important to talk to your doctor before trying out any indoor cycling class to make sure that your heart is healthy enough for high-intensity exercise.4. Pool Workouts Are Joint-Friendly Due to Their Lack of ImpactThe ultimate ""gentle"" exercise, in-the-water workouts such as swimming and water aerobics are not only zero impact, they are non-weight-bearing, removing the effects of gravity on your joints, Borchers says. In a March 2016 study in the The Journal of Rheumatology, researchers studied middle-aged and older adults with osteoarthritis, and found that pool workouts significantly reduced their joint pain and stiffness while boosting their muscle strength and functionality.Many gyms and community centers have indoor swimming pools for year-round water workouts, so check out what options are available near you. If you're new to swimming, try taking a class to learn the basics so that you can enter the water safely and with confidence.RELATED: Why You Should Consider Adding Weight Training to Your Diabetes Exercise Routine5. Elliptical, Stair-Climber, and Rower Training Are Low-Impact Cardio OptionsThe American Diabetes Association recommends performing at least 30 minutes of low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise five times per week. Ellipticals, stair-climbers, and rowers are all great ways to get that cardio in, and with minimal impact. Ellipticals and stair-climbers are ideal for people who are comfortable having all of their weight over one foot at a time, while rowers train both the lower and upper body at once, Borchers says.6. Weight-Bearing Strength Training Exercises Can Help With Blood Sugar ControlStanding (aka weight-bearing) strength training workouts strengthen your bones to help prevent diabetes-related joint and bone issues while boosting lean muscle mass and strength, according to the National Institutes of Health. ""The more lean body mass you have, the more glucose uptake and the better blood sugar control you will have,"" Eckert-Norton says. Plus, a March 2017 study in Nutrition &amp; Metabolism shows that strength training directly combats many of the metabolic changes that occur in muscles with type 2 diabetes.When beginning a strength routine, it's important to take the time to master proper form, Borchers says. If you don't know technique (and even if you think you do!), consider scheduling a few sessions with a certified trainer near you who has experience working with people with diabetes.RELATED: How Weight Loss May Put Type 2 Diabetes in Remission7. Chair Exercises Are a Convenient Way to Help Boost Your StabilityBreak a sweat without leaving the couch. For anyone who has mobility and stability issues (or just wants to work out while watching TV), seated strength-training exercises are a great option for strengthening the upper and even lower body. ""In most people who have neuropathy problems in the feet, the hands are still quite functional,"" Eckert-Norton says. That makes shoulder presses, bicep curls, and other lifting exercises very doable.To strengthen the legs from the seated position, try heel and toe taps, seated marches, and banded hip abductions.",https://t.co/69aVv8LeHh,others
High Testosterone In Women + What to Do About It,"High testosterone in women is a real concern for many women. In fact, the question shows up on my Facebook or Instagram page about once per week, which means we are loooong overdue for this article.""I can't keep up with the amount of hair on my chin! At this rate, I'm going to end up in the circus as the bearded lady,"" 36-year-old Shannon shared.In addition to hair on her chin, she was now shaving her belly, experiencing terribly oily skin and acne. Shannon's symptoms pointed to high testosterone. It's important to keep in mind as we dive into this topic that testosterone is good for women. But like all hormones (and most things in life) too much of a good thing can be big trouble. High Testosterone in Women Can Cause… What Causes Excess Testosterone levels in women?There can be several mechanisms at play, but one of the most common causes of elevated testosterone levels in women is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). But here's the tricky part… not every woman with elevated testosterone has PCOS. This was true of Shannon. All of Shannon's google searches were turning up PCOS. ""But I've never missed a period in my life!"" She explained her periods had always been regular and remained regular. Her skin had been clear for the majority of her adult life. It was only in the last couple of years the pimples began to crop up, especially around her jawline.She had noticed the darkening of her facial hair. The need to blot her face more often due to excess oil. Then the acne became a regular resident and the chin hair took a sharp turn towards dark, thick and coarse.Unfortunately, the hair change is irreversible, you have to get it professionally removed once it becomes thick and coarse. This didn't mean she had to live with it! It certainly didn't mean we weren't going to try to prevent her from getting more!How Insulin &amp; Blood Sugar Issues Cause High Testosterone in Women I explained to Shannon that the same mechanisms that cause high testosterone in women with PCOS were likely at play. Shannon was an 'eat on the run' kind of gal and admitted that she was pretty inconsistent about meals. Although she was eating dairy and gluten-free, she often ate a bag of gluten-free pretzels or fruit when feeling ""desperately hungry."" Blood sugar dysregulation is at the crux of many hormone imbalances, with elevated testosterone being no exception. That means this missing meals business was wreaking havoc on Shannon's complexion and mood.It was these spikes and dips in blood sugar that were creating strain on Shannon's adrenals. Her lab testing revealed HPA dysregulation and elevation of inflammatory markers. Shannon's adrenals were struggling and as a result her inflammation was climbing. Her insulin levels were mildly elevated, along with clear signs her blood sugar was often higher than it should be. As insulin climbs it can stimulate the adrenals to produce testosterone. While many body tissues will begin ignoring insulin signals (insulin resistance), your ovaries are among the few organs that will continue to remain sensitive to insulin. Even when insulin just will not quit bugging that cell!This stimulation causes the ovary to produce testosterone. In women with PCOS (and the chronic insulin overstimulation that accompanies it), this can lead to the typical structural changes that are seen in PCOS.What to Do About That High Testosterone…While Shannon's doctor strongly encouraged her to get on the birth control pill to drop her testosterone, Shannon was concerned about the other side effects. And rightly so! The pill can definitely lower testosterone, but at the expense of your libido and mood. Shannon's goal was to get to the root cause of her symptoms without suppressing her body's normal hormones function. I explained that in order for us to have a clear understanding of where her hormones and body were imbalanced we couldn't introduce a pharmaceutical that masks the underlying cause. So we got to work quickly with lab testing and natural therapies. One of our first steps was to get Shannon on a regular meal schedule, including fat and protein with meals. We swapped out her 3 cups of black coffee for green tea. Green tea increases Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), a protein that grabs onto excess testosterone. We also got her going with fresh ground flax seed, which is a great source of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids and has been shown to also raise SHBG. I started Shannon on hormone supportive herbs Saw Palmetto, Vitex, and Licorice. Because natural therapies can take time to improve symptoms we wasted no time in getting her hormones back on course.These herbs are part of my PCOS Basic Kit (no you don't have to have PCOS to have elevated testosterone), which is designed to help support healthy hormone production, including adrenal, testosterone, estrogen and progesterone. When all of these hormones are in balance women feel the super powers that come with having incredibly healthy hormones.Shannon had lifestyle homework too. Regular sleep, meals, and a daily journaling practice to help her release the stress of the day.With the help of my clinical team, Shannon was able to bring her testosterone back into balance. Along with her other hormones, she was able to get clear, beautiful skin. After having electrolysis to remove the unwanted hair, Shannon was happy to report there was no new growth. (Remember, once it has gone course there is no going back without professional hair removal. That's why Shannon's hair troubles required an additional healthcare team member – the esthetician).High Testosterone? Here's Where to Start with SupplementsI generally recommend women begin with 4 key supplements: Balance, Adrenal Support, Saw Palemetto Plus, and N-Acetyl Cysteine because of their synergistic benefits.Balance contains Vitex, in addition to green tea extract, DIM, and calcium d-glucarate to support estrogen and testosterone metabolism. Learn about Balance here.Adrenal Support contains licorice, which has been shown to have great benefit in women with PCOS and excess testosterone symptoms. Because the adrenal glands can be a source of excess androgens, optimizing adrenal health can be tremendously beneficial for women who have high testosterone. Learn about Adrenal Support here.Saw Palmetto Plus contains zinc and Saw Palmetto, are important for keeping high testosterone symptoms in check. Saw Palmetto is an herb that prevents the conversion of testosterone to DHT, a potent form that causes hair loss on our head and growth on our chin and chest. Learn about Saw Palmetto Plus here.I've bundled Balance, Adrenal Support, and Saw Palmetto Plus into one package called the PCOS Basic Kit.N-Acetyl Cysteine is an important amino acid for optimizing weight, improving hair and skin, and creating clear skin. Learn about N-Acetyl Cysteine here.All of these supplements together support a healthy menstrual cycle, glowing skin, and easier to manage weight.Does talk of excess testosterone conjure up images of a bearded lady for you too?

Insulin too pricey? Some options to cut costs for diabetics,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The skyrocketing price of insulin has some diabetics scrambling to cover the cost of the life-saving medication.Others are skipping doses or using smaller amounts than needed, and sometimes landing in the emergency room, patients and advocates told Congress recently.About 7.4 million Americans use insulin to keep their blood sugar at safe levels. Insulin needs vary by patient, as do costs depending on insurance coverage.Amid the public uproar about costs, drugmakers and some prescription plans are starting to offer patients bigger discounts. Express Scripts and its parent company, insurer Cigna, just began offering a month's worth of insulin to eligible patients for $25 per month. Express Scripts is now lining up other insurers whose prescription plans it manages.For most insulin and other diabetes medicines, manufacturers offer coupons reducing monthly out-of-pocket costs.The American Diabetes Association connects patients to assistance programs through www.insulinhelp.org , though not everyone qualifies.""We do not want anyone to skip or ration doses,"" says Dr. William Cefalu, the advocacy group's chief scientific officer.If you are struggling to afford insulin, tell your doctors, says Cefalu. They might be able to recommend a free clinic or patient assistance plan, or suggest cheaper options.If cost is an issue, here are other ways to save money:TRY OLDER KINDS OF INSULINTalk to your doctor about switching to older, cheaper kinds of insulin, suggests Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Dangerous blood sugar plunges are more common with those, as they don't control blood sugar as tightly as newer, more expensive insulins. Patients using older products such as Novolin and Humulin R must test their blood sugar more often, and more carefully time when they inject insulin before meals, Gabbay stresses.Patients who've been using insulin pens — injection devices containing multiple insulin doses — could switch to insulin vials. They are cheaper but less convenient. It requires drawing insulin out of the vial into a syringe, which makes doses less precise, and the abdominal injections hurt a bit more. Another option is Basaglar, a cheaper near-copy of the popular long-acting Lantus insulin pens.Review your insurance company's list of covered medications for insulin with the lowest copayments; coverage and copayments often change in January and there may be cheaper choices. Other savings options include getting a 90-day supply instead of 30-day refills.Check prices at different pharmacies. Prices can vary widely for insulin, other diabetes drugs and the testing strips and lancets needed to check blood sugar levels. Patients can look up drug prices at multiple drugstores and get coupons for big discounts at the pharmacy counter at www.GoodRx.com . Or try www.healthwarehouse.com , which sells medicines at cash prices, which can be cheaper even if you have insurance.Medicare and Medicaid patients can't combine coupons with their insurance, but a coupon alone might be the cheapest option.The three main insulin makers offer savings, including:—Sanofi's Insulins ValYOU Savings Program offers uninsured and cash-paying patients one insulin vial for $99 or one insulin pen for $149 each month. Starting in June, it will offer up to 10 vials and/or pens of most of its insulins for $99. Its Sanofi Patient Connection offers low-income uninsured patients free insulin.—Eli Lilly will soon sell Insulin Lispro, a half-price version of its top-selling insulin Humalog KwikPens, for $265 per month. Its Lilly Diabetes Solution Center helps patients find affordable options.—Novo Nordisk has long sold an older insulin, ReliOn, through Walmart for about $25 a vial. It's now available through CVS Health and Express Scripts. Novo Nordisk offers copay savings cards for Tresiba and other insulins, plus patient assistance with generous income limits at www.NovoCare.com .",https://t.co/7k3bT3LEkS,others

Rosemary Tea: What It's Good For and How to Brew,"Rosemary is one of the most widely recognized herbal medicines. It has been used for centuries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas to treat a host of illnesses. Today, medical research has backed up many of these health claims.Drinking rosemary tea is a great way to boost immune health: plus it's delicious! Rosemary tea offers a delightful pine flavor and aromatic fragrance that is invigorating and rejuvenating. Discover the stunning flavors of rosemary tea and learn more about its health benefits, side effects, and proper brewing methods.What Is Rosemary Tea?Rosemary tea is made from the leaves of the rosemary plant known by the botanical name Rosmarinus officinalis. The rosemary plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is an evergreen shrub. The rosemary shrub belongs to the mint family, which also includes lavender, thyme, basil, and sage. The leaves are used to make rosemary essential oil, rosemary extract, and rosemary tea.Rosemary tea is an herbal tea and is rich in vitamins, iron, and calcium. The herb is commonly used in culinary dishes and to make essential oils. Rosemary is a perennial plant, making it a popular garden plant. You can brew the tea using rosemary leaves straight from your garden.In ancient times, rosemary tea was used to treat everything from hair loss to digestive system ailments. Today, research shows rosemary tea may be beneficial to health when combined with a healthy diet and lifestyle.Flavor ProfileRosemary tea is naturally caffeine-free and can be consumed throughout the day. Rosemary tea offers strong notes of pine with subtle undertones of lemon and mint. This tea also boasts a sharp, fragrant pine smell that invigorates the senses.Health Benefits of Rosemary Tea1. Streamlines DigestionDrinking rosemary tea can help improve digestive processes that keep your gut healthy and happy. Rosemary tea boasts antispasmodic properties that help to reduce gas and bloating. This herbal tea also supports healthy gut bacteria and improves nutrient absorption.Rosemary tea also contains carnosic acid, a compound that helps balance the microflora and good bacteria in your gut. Drinking rosemary tea can help your digestive system recover after a bout of illness or improve an upset stomach (1). A healthy gut microbiome means your body can help fend off infections more easily and can also help aid weight loss since your body processes fats more efficiently. 2. Helps Eliminate Free RadicalsRosemary tea is rich in antioxidants that help boost overall health and prevent damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are cells that wreak havoc in the body by causing oxidative stress, which is the body's form of rust. Oxidative stress has been linked to serious illness including Alzheimer's disease, premature aging, and certain types of cancer (2).The antioxidant activity of rosemary tea helps to flush out free radicals and prevent the onset of oxidative stress. These potent antioxidants mostly consist of tea polyphenols and flavonoids.3. Boosts Immune HealthRosemary helps boost immunity thanks to its rich concentration of antioxidants and vitamins. Rosemary tea contains high amounts of vitamin C, which has been shown to boost immune health and prevent illness caused by bacteria and viruses (3). Rosemary tea also has high concentrations of vitamin A, magnesium, potassium, and calcium to keep your immune system working at peak levels.4. May Regulate Blood Sugar and Heart HealthRosemary tea contains camphene, luteolin, and carnosol, which help to regulate blood sugar levels and promote heart health. In a study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, researchers examined the mechanism of rosemary tea on heart health. Researchers found that rosmarinic acid helps to inhibit the peroxidation of lipids in rabbits (4).Another study published in 2017 found that rosemary tea may help lower high blood pressure. Results showed that rosemary tea acts as a blood thinner, helping to improve circulation and decrease the risk of blood clots and heart attacks (5).5. May Promote Hair GrowthRosemary oil has long been touted as a natural remedy for premature hair loss conditions such as alopecia. Drinking rosemary tea may offer some of the same benefits. Rosemary tea helps to increase blood circulation, which stimulates hair follicles and increase hair growth. The increased circulation also delivers vital nutrients to hair follicles that help to build stronger strands.You can also use rosemary tea topically as a hair rinse or shampoo to boost hair growth. A rosemary hair rinse can help to eliminate dandruff and remove product build-up that can weigh down hair.Side Effects of Rosemary TeaAllergiesAvoid rosemary tea if you are allergic to the rosemary plant or another plant in the same family. People with allergies to aspirin or salicylate drugs may also develop allergies to rosemary tea. Use with caution and stop use immediately if you experience any symptoms of allergic reaction including runny nose, itchy throat, or difficulty breathing. Pregnant Women Seek medical advice before using rosemary tea if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Compounds in rosemary tea may induce menstrual periods and increase the risk of miscarriage and complications. Rosemary tea may also cause uterine bleeding when consumed in high amounts.Risk of SeizuresThe rosemary leaf has anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties that may worsen certain conditions including epilepsy. Always talk to a healthcare professional before drinking herbal teas if you are taking medications or have serious health problems.How to Brew Rosemary TeaIngredients:1 teaspoon rosemary leaves (fresh or dried)8-10 oz spring or filtered water1 teaspoon sweetener such as honey or sugar (OPTIONAL)Instructions:1.

Isotonix Advanced Nutraceuticals by Market America,"Chromium PicolinateChromium picolinate is an essential trace mineral which promotes efficient functioning of insulin, which is important because good insulin activity is critical for hunger control, supporting metabolism, building and retaining muscle and vital organ tissue. Chromium picolinate is good for individuals trying to lose weight since it helps retain muscle mass. When muscle tissue is lost, it may reduce the metabolic rate.*Chromium Arginate Chromium arginate is a form of chromium that is bonded with the essential amino acid Arginine. Like chromium picolinate, it too can support normal insulin activity and the metabolism of protein, fat and carbohydrates. Together with chromium picolinate, chromium arginate helps to support cardiovascular health by helping to maintain normal insulin sensitivity. It also helps maintain healthy blood sugar and cholesterol levels, preserve lean muscle mass and control sugar cravings.*Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 belongs to a family of substances called ubiquinones and is a fat-soluble, wax-like substance that is part of the respiratory chain. It is synthesized in the cells and is involved in electron transport and energy production in mitochondria where about 95 percent of the total energy required by the human body is generated. In the cellular system, CoQ10 functions to generate energy from oxygen, in the form of ATP. CoQ10 also exhibits activity as a free radical scavenger and an antioxidant. The antioxidant activity in the mitochondria and cell membranes protects against peroxidation of lipid membranes.* Coenzyme Q10 can be found in spinach, broccoli, nuts, meats and fish. In the body, it is found in highest concentration in the cells of the heart, liver, kidney, spleen and pancreas, which all require vast amounts of energy. Supplementation with CoQ10 may be most beneficial for adults because the levels of CoQ10 in the body tend to peak around the age of 20 and then decline with age. L-CarnitineL-carnitine is an amino acid that is found in nearly all cells of the body. L-carnitine supports fat metabolism in the heart, organs and tissue. L-carnitine occurs naturally in animal products and only very small amounts are found in plants, with a few exceptions, such as avocado and some fermented soy products. It also plays an essential role in the transporting of long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria of the cell, which results in additional energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). L-carnitine is synthesized in the body, mainly in the liver and kidneys, from the essential amino acids L-lysine and L-methionine.*Lipase Lipase is a fat-digesting enzyme that supports the body's normal breakdown of dietary fats into an absorbable form. Lipases, such as human pancreatic lipase, support the normal conversion of triglyceride substrates found in oils from food to monoglycerides and free fatty acids. Some lipases also work within the interior spaces of living cells to support the normal degradation of lipids.",https://t.co/G6uiJsQZpy,others
Amazon Announces 6 New HIPAA Compliant Alexa Skills,"Posted By HIPAA Journal on Apr 5, 2019Share this article on:Six new HIPAA compliant Alexa skills have been launched by Amazon that allow protected health information to be transmitted without violating HIPAA Rules.The new HIPAA compliant Alexa skills were developed by six different companies that have participated in the Amazon Alexa healthcare program. The new skills allow patients to schedule appointments, find urgent care centers, receive updates from their care providers, access their latest blood sugar reading, and check the status of their prescriptions.This is not the first time that Alexa skills have been developed, but a stumbling block has been the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which limit the use of voice technology with protected health information. Now, thanks to HIPAA compliant data transfers, the voice assistant can now be used by a select group of healthcare organizations to communicate PHI without violating the HIPAA Privacy Rule. You can read more about the issues related to virtual assistants and HIPAA compliance here.Amazon has stated that it plans to work with many other developers through an invite-only program to develop new skills to use within its HIPAA-eligible environment. Amazon is offering those organizations business associate agreements to meet HIPAA requirements. The initial roll-out has been limited to six new HIPAA compliant Alexa skills as detailed below:New HIPAA Compliant Alexa SkillsThe purpose of the new skills is to allow patients, caregivers, and health plan members to use Amazon Alexa to manage their healthcare at home through voice commands. The skills make it easier for patients to perform healthcare-related tasks, access their health data, and interact with their providers.The six new HIPAA compliant Alexa skills are:Express ScriptsMembers of the Express Scripts pharmacy services organization can check the status of a home delivery prescription and can ask Alexa to send notifications when prescriptions have been shipped and when they arrive at their door.Cigna Health TodayEmployees who have been enrolled in a Cigna health plan can use this Alexa skill to check wellness program goals, receive health tips, and access further information on rewards.My Children's Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)Parents and caregivers of children enrolled in Boston Children's Hospital's ERAS program can send updates to their care teams on recovery progress. Care teams can also send information on post-op appointments and pre- and post-op guidance. Initially, the skill is being used in relation to cardiac surgery patients, although the program will be expanded in the near future.Livongo Blood Sugar LookupParticipants in Livongo's Diabetes Program can query their latest blood sugar reading from their device, check blood sugar monitoring trends such as their weekly average reading, and receive personalized health tips through their Alexa device.Atrium HealthAtrium Health's new Alexa skill allows patients to find urgent care locations near them and schedule same-day appointments, find out about opening hours, and current waiting times. Initially the Alexa skill is being offered to customers in North and South Carolina.Swedish Health ConnectProvidence St. Joseph Health has created an Alexa skill that allows patients to find Swedish Express Care Clinics in their vicinity and schedule same day appointments at 37 of its locations on the west coast.",https://t.co/kuVQTki8IC,others
"High LDL, Diet, Symptoms, Dangers, and More","Lipids, also referred to as fats, are one of the three macronutrients that are an essential part of the diet. There are various types of lipids, including steroids, phospholipids, and triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of lipid that the body can use for both immediate and stored energy.When you eat a meal, your body uses the nutrients from that meal as energy or fuel. However, if you eat a meal with too much energy (too many calories), this excess energy gets converted into triglycerides. These triglycerides are stored in fat cells for use at a later time.The most common concern about triglycerides is high triglyceride levels. High levels of triglycerides in the blood may contribute to atherosclerosis, the clogging and hardening of the arteries. Because of this, high triglyceride levels may increase your risk of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke. Low triglyceride levels may be a health concern as well. Let's look at how low triglycerides may affect your health and how to prevent and treat related problems.A healthy dietWe know that an unhealthy diet can cause high triglycerides, while a healthy diet generally leads to low triglycerides. One interesting note is that sometimes low triglyceride levels can occur with high LDL levels (which often indicate a higher heart disease risk). If low triglyceride levels lower heart disease risk, but high LDL levels increase it, what can cause this inconsistency?There are two types of LDL particles that should be taken into account when calculating heart disease risk:LDL-A particles are larger, less dense, and lower your risk.LDL-B particles are smaller, denser, and increase your risk.When you have low triglyceride levels but high LDL levels, it could indicate that you have a diet filled with healthy fats. Healthy fats will not only cause an increase in good cholesterol (HDL) but can also change the type of the LDL particles in the blood. Therefore, those high LDL levels may not actually be a bad thing.Instead, it is more likely that they are LDL particles that have become larger and less dense from the intake of healthy fat. Low triglycerides and high HDL levels in the blood will generally support this idea.A very low-fat dietLow-fat diets aren't necessarily unhealthy. Research has shown that low-fat diets can be an effective way to lose weight. However, anything done on an extreme scale can be dangerous, and very low-fat diets are no exception to the rule.People on low-fat diets who are consuming very little fat may have lower triglyceride levels. With fat being an essential part of human metabolism, it is important to consume at least some fat — preferably, the healthy kind.Long-term fastingFasting is the abstinence of food and drink, and for some people it's one of the ways in which they improve their health. Fasting can have many health benefits, from lowering blood sugar and lipid levels to aiding in weight loss. In a small 2010 study, researchers found that in people who partook in alternate-day fasting (a type of intermittent fasting) over eight weeks, triglyceride levels were lowered by roughly 32 percent.A longer period of fasting may produce more dramatic results. For those with already normal levels, this could potentially lead to very low triglyceride levels. Instead of fasting for long periods of time, or fasting every other day, a shorter stint of intermittent fasting may be just as effective, without lowering your levels too much. This could mean fasting for 8 or 16 hours each day, rather than skipping food entirely for 24 hours.MalnutritionMalnutrition occurs when the body is not getting enough of, or alternately too much of, certain nutrients. According to the World Health Organization, more than 2.3 billion adults in the United States experience malnutrition in some form.Undernutrition can lead to deficiencies in important nutrients, including macronutrients such as lipids. Some symptoms of malnutrition include:weight loss, fat loss, and muscle mass losshollow cheeks and eyesa protruding, or swollen, stomachdry and brittle hair, skin, or nailsemotional symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and irritabilityIf someone is experiencing severe undernutrition, their triglyceride levels may be well below the normal range. Undernutrition is best treated with increased food intake and, in some cases, supplementation of vitamins and minerals.MalabsorptionMalabsorption is a condition in which the small intestine is unable to properly absorb the nutrients from food. Causes of malabsorption may include damage to the digestive tract, diseases affecting the digestive tract, or even certain drugs. For people who experience malabsorption, the body may not be able to properly absorb carbohydrates, proteins, or fats. There are many symptoms of malabsorption. However, fat malabsorption can lead to a condition called steatorrhea. Steatorrhea is a major indicator that your body isn't absorbing fats properly. You may notice:pale and foul-smelling stoolsstools that are bulkier and floatgrease or fat in your stoolsdrops of oil or fat in the water surrounding your stoolsPeople who have trouble absorbing fats may have low triglyceride levels. Treatment for steatorrhea involves addressing underlying conditions that may be causing malabsorption with medication and lifestyle changes.HyperthyroidismThe thyroid gland plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism. In people with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), regular metabolic processes can be greatly affected. Some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:an enlarged thyroid gland, called a goiterunintentional weight loss and appetite changesalterations in heart ratethinning of the skin and haircognitive changes, such as increased anxiety or nervousnessOne of the biggest indicators of hyperthyroidism is unintentional weight loss. Generally, this weight loss occurs regardless of food intake. This means that the body is always using up more energy than that person is consuming. People with hyperthyroidism may have low levels of triglycerides due to the increased use of these triglycerides for fuel. Blood tests that measure levels of thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone may be used to diagnose hyperthyroidism. It's generally treated with medication and lifestyle changes.Cholesterol-lowering drugsAccording to a 2015 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly ""78.1 million Americans were already taking or are eligible for cholesterol-lowering medication."" Cholesterol medication, or lipid-lowering drugs, are one of the ways in which people can get their cholesterol levels under control.There are many different types of lipid-lowering medications, including statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and more. Statins, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters are three types of lipid-lowering drugs that are known to lower triglyceride levels.If you're concerned that your cholesterol-lowering drugs are causing your triglyceride levels to drop too low, consider speaking with a doctor to switch medications.",https://t.co/uqvUU2sl2y?,others
Diamaxol™ Daily Nutritional Support for Healthy Blood Sugar Lifestyle Choices,"A Simple Step to Support Your Healthy Blood Sugar! As our body's main source of energy, blood sugar is essential to our health. Too little blood sugar can prompt hunger and hunger-related symptoms including sweating, shakiness, dizziness, weakness, mood changes, and fatigue. However, too much blood sugar can create problems of its own: dry mouth, increased thirst, increased urination, drowsiness, and stomach pain. When it comes to healthy blood sugar, moderation is best – not too little and not too much either. Just the amount your body needs to carry out all its many roles! Are you taking steps to keep your blood sugar in healthful balance? Focus on Whole, Fiber-Rich Plant Foods. Besides delivering a wide array of beneficial nutrients; whole grains, leafy greens, and vegetables all contain a large amount of fiber. Fiber helps keep blood sugar balanced in two main ways: 1. it keeps you feeling fuller for longer so it's easier to resist less healthy foods and 2. it helps prevent dips or spikes in blood sugar, by slowing sugar absorption in your body. Avoid Refined Grains and Sugary Foods. Foods which are low in fiber and high in carbohydrates are the quickest way to cause a blood sugar spike. Help prevent this by eliminating or reducing the amount of sweeteners (including sugar, honey, agave nectar, and maple syrup), white grain products (including white rice), white potatoes, fruit juice, dried fruit, and alcohol in your diet. Stay Hydrated. Drinking an adequate amount of water each day helps prevent overeating and supports your kidneys' ability to flush out excess blood sugar via urine. Keep a glass or water bottle nearby to help you stay on top of your water consumption. Get Moving. Moderate exercise increases your body's energy/glucose use, helping rid the body of excess blood sugar. It also helps improve your body's insulin use and promotes healthy weight loss (another factor in controlling blood sugar balance.) Just remember to listen to your body and not to overdo it. Very strenuous exercise, too far beyond what your body is used to, can lead to stress hormone release, which in turn can actually increase blood sugar temporarily. Slow and steady wins the race! Reduce Your Stress Level. When you are mentally, emotionally, or physically stressed, your body releases hormones which can cause blood sugar levels to rise. Reduce stress with a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and stress reducing activities like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness techniques. Manage Your Weight. Carrying excess weight above a healthy BMI can dramatically increase your risk of unbalanced blood sugar. Experts say women with a waist circumference of 35+ inches (88.9 cm) and men with a waist circumference of 40+ inches (101.6 cm) should be especially wary. Fortunately, even a 7% weight reduction can decrease your risk by 58%! Take Diamaxol! You're eating right. You're staying hydrated. You're exercising moderately, managing your stress level, and you're at, or working toward a healthy weight and waist ratio. Unfortunately, age and genetic predisposition may mean you're still at risk! What else can you do to keep your blood sugar balance healthy? Diamaxol combines 18 clinically-researched ingredients to make protecting your healthy blood sugar balance easier than ever. Just two daily doses deliver naturally powerful blood sugar support you can feel great about every day!** **Diamaxol uses only ingredients which have been clinically studied for their use in helping support healthy blood sugar balance. However, Diamaxol as a composite formulation has not been clinically studied and its ingredient amounts may differ from those used in existing studies. The results of clinical studies on the individual ingredients in Diamaxol can not be assumed to reflect the results of taking Diamaxol as a composite formulation. Diamaxol is solely intended for support of health blood sugar balance with normal ranges as part of a healthy lifestyle including diet and exercise. Alpha Lipoic Acid Made naturally in our bodies, and found in trace amounts in certain foods, alpha lipoic acid (also known as α-lipoic acid, ALA, and thioctic acid) is a powerful antioxidant that's essential for ""aerobic metabolism"" – the digestion and use of nutrients in the body. In Germany, alpha lipoic acid has been used as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy since its approval as a drug in 1966. Now the rest of the world is catching up and taking interest in the potential of this amazing micronutrient! While more research is needed, there is strong evidence to support alpha lipoic acid's use in promoting nerve health and functioning, and healthy insulin resistance too!* Diamaxol provides 100mg of Alpha Lipoic Acid daily.

COMPLETE STUDY DETAILS HERE Cayenne Originating in the Cayenne region of French Guiana, cayenne is one of many pepper varieties in the capsicum family referred to as ""chili"" – the Aztec Indian name for this long spicy fruit. In native Mexican tribes such as the Maya, chili peppers, including cayenne were used not only to season food, but spiritually and medicinally. Even today, cayenne is a popular Mexican folk remedy which mothers feed to their ill children. Now, researchers are finding the truth in folk wisdom.

Is Oatmeal Good for Diabetics?,"Here are a few common questions and concerns that we always receive around oatmeal and diabetes:""Do u know if eating oatmeal is good for diabetics?""""I make steel cut oats in the morning and put in honey (from the honey place – real made) some chia seeds, walnuts, half an apple and pumpkin or other seeds if I have them – is this enough to balance out the sugar?""""My sugars go crazy when I eat oatmeal but I was told by a dietitian to eat it.""""I'm confused, can I eat oatmeal, not the packaged kind?""Is Oatmeal Good for Diabetics? (The Short Answer)The short answer: Oatmeal could be okay for you – some type 2 diabetics can eat it. But, it is a higher carb food and for that reason, many type 2 diabetics can't tolerate it.Unfortunately, there is no clear answer on this, which is often the case with many individual food items.The question for you to ask is, how is your blood sugar and A1C?If you're struggling to get it under control, you might consider eliminating the oatmeal and opting for lower carb foods (aka more vegetables). Or, you could try testing to see if oats influence your results.Is Oatmeal Good for Diabetics? (The Long Answer)Let's explore a whole range of things to consider with oats and oatmeal – including nutrition, glycemic index (GI), research, and so forth.Research on Oatmeal and Type 2 DiabetesThe research around oats/ oatmeal for type 2 diabetes treatment does show mixed results.A review in Food and Function, 2016, looked at a range of studies but only 4 of those studies included type 2 diabetic patients. An important point to raise is that the results concluded from studies in those without diabetes (healthy subjects) is NOT necessarily going to result in the same conclusions in people who already have diabetes.Diabetes prevention and diabetes treatment are two completely different things. Yet in many cases the two terms are used interchangeably. Take note of this if you're reading things and you will start to see that much of the information around is about diabetes prevention, rather than treatment.Anyway, back to the Food and Function review – they found an average reduction of (1.98 mg/dl (0.11mmol/l) in fasting glucose for the overall studies, but interestingly, this was only found significant in Asian subgroups, NOT Western. When subgrouping the diabetics alone, this result was higher at 15.12 mg/dl (0.84 mmol/l).Another review in Nutrients, 2015, showed that in general, compared to control groups, those eating oats have lower cholesterol levels (range −0.10 to −0.80 mmol/L) and lower fasting glucose (range 1.26-34.28 mg/dl or 0.07-1.91 mmol/l).However, the authors note that glucose levels at baseline were high – an average HbA1c 9.87% and average fasting blood glucose 179.82 mg/dl/ 9.99 mmol/L. And because both diets were low on energy, they suggest that ""oats consumption might show its benefits especially when the general energy intake was low.""They also mentioned that half the studies were low quality evidence but still included the results in the review anyway, which does somewhat downgrade the conclusions.Yet another earlier review in the British Journal of Nutrition, 2014, showed that, ""there was a slight decrease in fasting glucose concentrations, glycated hemoglobin and HOMA-IR in subjects after oat intake, but the difference was not significant,"" as reported on The Nutrition Society.Overall, the research shows some decreases to fasting blood glucose, decreases to cholesterol, possible decreases in insulin, and no effect on A1C.Therefore, overall, the research is not shouting out YES, oats are awesome for diabetes treatment. But it does indicate that in some people oats can be show some beneficial results.Nutritional Facts About OatsThe most well known thing about oats is they are a high fiber food source.Fiber – is amazing! We need it for healthy digestion, feeding gut bacteria, reducing cholesterol, helping us feel full, keeping the bowels moving, improving metabolism, and managing blood sugar.Majority of people don't get enough fiber. We need around 30 g a day, but most people get around half that much. In particular, oats are a good source of soluble fiber. β-glucan comprises a fairly large component of the soluble fiber of oats – it is a nondigestible polysaccharide at a rate of 2.2-7.8%.The fact that oats/ oatmeal do contain fiber, is one of the major reasons it is considered a healthy food. And overall, when it comes to cereals, oats are definitely your best option. You certainly don't want to be eating packaged choc pops or something like that!FoodsEnergyProteinFatCarbsFiberNet CarbsOats 1 cup (39g)151.756.582.6425.844.1221.72Instant Oats 1 pack (28 g)1013.341.9319.472.816.67Quaker instant oatmeal 1 packet (41g)1506.562.5827.47423.47Oats, regular quick 1 packet (81g)30710.655.2854.848.246.64As you can see from this table, oats are quite high in carbs. If you do eat it, you only want to be eating about 1/4 cup at one sitting. And while oats do contain fiber, so do vegetables. And vegetables compared to oats contain more fiber and less carbohydrates. For example, 1/2 avocado has 6.7 g fiber. 1 cup broccoli has around 5 g fiber and 1 carrot has nearly 2 g fiber.So the question arises: Is your blood glucose and A1C going to be better without oats and with the inclusion of more vegetables?Glycemic Index of Oats and OatmealGlycemic index is just another indication of how different foods influence blood glucose on a 0 to 100 scale. The lower the number, the lower GI. Foods under 55 are generally considered low GI, while those over 55 are considered high GI foods.The GI of oats and oatmeal according to The University of Sydney's Glycemic Index:Uncooked rolled oats GI 59, 30 g serve, 19 g carbs.Traditional porridge oats, made from whole oats GI 51-58, 250 g serve, ~21 g carbs.Oat Bran/ Quaker oats GI 50-60, 10 g serve, 5-6 g carbs.Quick oats/ One minute oats/ instant porridge GI 65-66, 250 g serve, 26 g carbs,.Instant oatmeal porridge, from packet GI 83, 250 g serve, 23 g carbs.Do's and Don't's of Eating OatsDO choose whole oats – If you're going to eat oats, the research indicates that whole oats are the best choice, which is kind of a common sense thing. Skip the instant and quick cooking stuff.DON'T add fruit and honey – given that oats already contain a higher amount of carbs, you don't want to go adding fruit, raisins and honey, which further skyrockets carb count. Try adding nuts, seeds and vanilla extract to balance out the carbs with healthy fats and protein.DON'T overeat oats – you need to watch your portion sizes because like most higher carb foods, it's easy to overload. Try limiting your serving size to just ½ cup of oats at one serve.DO test and see how oats influence you – try testing to see if oats influence your results. At the end of the day, each individual person with diabetes has a different carbohydrate tolerance. Some may be able to tolerate oats, while others can't.DO eat more fiber rich foods – change up your breakfast ideas. Opt for eggs and a veggie filled plate, or a delicious mixed veggie omelet. We have cereals ingrained into our brains as breakfast foods but there are plenty of other great breakfast options.We don't include oats in our meal plans because they do have mixed results for different people. Instead, we prefer to encourage higher intake of non-starchy veggies, which contain valuable phytochemicals, flavonoids, vitamins, minerals and fiber too.Do you eat oats and oatmeal or not?

Honeymoon Phase - Honeymoon Period Causes and Duration,"Honeymoon Phase During the Honeymoon Phase, the pancreas is still able to produce significant amounts of insulin The Honeymoon Phase (or Honeymoon Period) amongst people with type 1 diabetes refers to the period of time shortly following diabetes diagnosis when the pancreas is still able to produce a significant amount of insulin to reduce insulin needs and aid blood glucose control. This does not, unfortunately, indicate that the diabetes is in remission or can be cured. How is the honeymoon period caused? Type 1 diabetes develops because the body begins to kill off its own insulin producing cells – know as islet cells. When a patient starts on insulin injections, the pancreas is under less pressure to produce insulin. This period of rest, afforded by the injections, stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin from the remaining beta cells. However, after a period of months, the vast majority of these remaining beta cells will also be destroyed, and the honeymoon period ends when the pancreas stops producing sufficient insulin to aid blood glucose control any more. What happens during the honeymoon phase? During the honeymoon phase, blood sugar levels are generally easier to control as the body still has some ability to help itself. Blood glucose levels may even return to normal levels during the honeymoon phase. Insulin doses may therefore need to be re-adjusted during this period and it is essential to communicate with your healthcare professional during this time. Can I stop taking insulin during the honeymoon period? A balance needs to be found between not taking too much insulin, and risking hypoglycemia, but also ensuring your body is not at risk of high blood glucose levels and the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis. For this reason, you'll need to discuss closely with your doctor the insulin doses you take. How long does the honeymoon period last? There is no hard and fast rule for how long the honeymoon phase lasts amongst people with type 1 diabetes. The diabetes honeymoon phase can last for weeks, months or in some cases years. Furthermore, the honeymoon period can fluctuate and appear to stop and start. Do I definitely have the honeymoon period if I'm experiencing better than expected blood glucose levels and a reduced need for insulin? If you have had type 1 diabetes for a number of years, it is unlikely you will see a re-occurence of the honeymoon period. If your blood glucose levels do become better than expected, it could be a result of your body becoming more sensitive to insulin which can happen when you take exercise, if you're in a warm environments (hot weather, warm baths), or as a response to a change in diet. Can I make the honeymoon phase last longer? Maintaining good blood glucose control should help the honeymoon phase to last longer, but there is no sure fire way to extend this phase. Stopping taking insulin or having fluctuating insulin levels could shorten the honeymoon period. Your healthcare professional should be able to advise you on the best adjustments to make.

Ramadan and diabetes,"Fasting for RamadanThe Qur'an requires Muslims to fast during the month of Ramadan from sunrise to sunset.However, there are exceptions to this. One of them is that people who are ill or have medical conditions do not have to fast. This includes people with diabetes. To find out more about this, you can speak to your Imam.For the next few years, Ramadan in the UK is in the late spring months and the length of fasts are long (15 hours or more). Long fasts put you at higher risk of hypoglycaemia and dehydration, which can make you ill.Ultimately, it is a personal choice whether or not to fast. However, if you do choose to fast, then you must consult your doctor or healthcare team before Ramadan, to make sure that you are able to look after yourself properly. Failing to do so is in itself contrary to the Qur'an, which clearly states that you must not act in a way that harms your body.This information will help you reduce the risks of becoming ill during Ramadan if you decide to fast, as well as highlighting the dangers of fasting for people with diabetes. VIDEO If you decide to fastIf, after consulting with your doctor, you decide to fast:If you are taking insulin, you will require less insulin before the start of the fastThe type of insulin may also need changing from your usual typePre-mixed insulin is not recommended during fastingBefore starting the fast, you should include more slowly absorbed food (low GI), such as basmati rice and dhal, in your meal, along with fruit and vegetablesCheck your blood glucose levels more often than you normally wouldWhen you break the fast, have only small quantities food, and avoid only eating sweet or fatty foodsTry to eat just before the break of dawn, when you commence the next day's fastAt the end of fasting you should drink plenty of sugar-free and decaffeinated fluids to avoid being dehydrated.Fasting during Ramadan factsheetDownload our factsheet about fasting and managing your diabetes during Ramadan, developed in partnership with the Muslim Council of Britain's Diabetes Advisory Group: VIDEO Risks of fastingIf you have complications associated with diabetes, such as poor vision or heart or kidney disease, the risk of aggravating these is very high and you should seriously consider not fastingFor people with diabetes taking certain tablets and/or insulin, fasting carries the risk of hypoglycaemia. If you feel that you are having a hypo, you must break your fast and take some sugary fluids followed by starchy food, in accordance with scripture, as otherwise you will harm your body and may need medical attentionYou may develop high blood glucose levels during a fast if you do not take prescribed medication or if you are less physically active than normal, which could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) – a serious condition requiring hospital treatment. Managing diabetes during Ramadan presentationA 2010 study published in the British Medical Journal* found that the change in eating patterns during Ramadan increased the risk of severe hyperglycaemia significantly.Our presentation (Powerpoint, 6.2MB) gives advice on fasting safely during Ramadan, and refers to passages from the holy text of the Qur'an which support a healthy lifestyle.

Fueling for fitness,"There are many myths surrounding fueling for a work out.""Often people think that they need to eat a lot more or that they can make unhealthy choices because they're exercising,"" says Lindsey Wohlford, MD Anderson Cancer Center employee wellness dietitian.While getting the right amount and type of fuel, or calories, isn't always easy, it is important.Managing calories before, during and after a workout will help you:Maintain blood sugar during exerciseMaximize exercise performanceImprove recovery time""Fueling and exercise work together, especially if you're trying to lose weight,"" Wohlford says.It's important to make sure you're getting the nutrients you need to work out and maintain a healthy weight, which will reduce your cancer risk..Follow these tips to fuel properly before, during and after you exercise.Fueling before you exerciseMake sure you've had the proper fuel before you work out.

Is It a Good Idea?,"Millions of people around the world depend on a morning cup of coffee to get their day started.Coffee is not only a great source of caffeine that provides a convenient boost of energy but also has many beneficial antioxidants and nutrients.A recent trend is to add coconut oil to coffee to reap the health benefits of this popular fat, too.However, you may wonder whether this practice is healthy.This article tells you whether you should drink coffee with coconut oil.Share on PinterestCoconut oil has become increasingly popular among people following the high-fat, very-low-carb ketogenic diet.Adding it to your coffee can help you reach or maintain ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body uses ketones — molecules produced from fat breakdown — as fuel instead of glucose, a type of sugar (1).Maintaining ketosis on a ketogenic diet has been linked to health benefits like weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and reduced heart disease risk factors (2, 3, 4).Coconut oil can help you stay in ketosis as it's loaded with fats called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs).Compared to other fats, MCTs are rapidly absorbed and immediately delivered to your liver. Here, they're either used as a source of energy or converted into ketone bodies (5).Interestingly, MCT oils are more easily converted to ketones than long-chain triglycerides, another type of fat found in foods (6). Research shows that MCTs can help you stay in ketosis — even if you eat slightly more protein and carbs than recommended on a classic ketogenic diet (6).Coconut oil has 4 types of MCTs, and 50% of its fat comes from the MCT lauric acid (7).Lauric acid appears to make ketones at a slower but more sustained rate as it's metabolized more steadily than other MCTs. Therefore, adding coconut oil to your coffee is an effective way to help you stay in ketosis (7, 8).Summary Coconut oil helps your body make ketones. If you follow a ketogenic diet, adding it to your cup of coffee may help you reach and stay in ketosis.Adding coconut oil to your coffee is an easy way to reap the health benefits of both.Here are some ways in which adding coconut oil to your coffee may improve health:May speed up your metabolism. Studies show that MCTs in coconut oil and caffeine in coffee may speed up your metabolism, which can increase the number of calories you burn in a day (9, 10, 11).May improve energy levels. Coffee contains caffeine, which can help you feel less tired. Coconut oil packs MCTs, which are transported straight to your liver and can act as a quick source of energy as well (12, 13).May help keep your bowels regular. Coconut oil MCTs and coffee compounds like caffeine and chlorogenic acids may help stimulate your bowels and keep your digestive system healthy (14, 15).May help raise HDL (good) cholesterol. Several studies have found that coconut oil can raise levels of HDL cholesterol, which is protective against heart disease (16, 17).However, adding coconut oil to coffee also has its drawbacks.For starters, many people who add it to their morning coffee use it as a breakfast replacement. Doing so means that you may miss out on many important nutrients that you would get from eating a more balanced breakfast.While coconut oil has some nutrients, it won't have as many as a nutritious breakfast that contains many different food groups.What's more, coconut oil is high in calories, providing 121 calories per tablespoon (14 grams). Most people who add it to coffee tend to use 2 tablespoons — an extra 242 calories (18).If this doesn't sound like much, note that it would take a 155-pound (70-kg) person nearly 50 minutes of walking at a brisk pace (3.5 miles or 5.6 km per hour) to burn that many calories (19).Additionally, while the combined effect of coconut oil and coffee may slightly boost your metabolism, it's more likely to make you gain weight if you don't account for the added calories.The calories in a few tablespoons of coconut oil are likely to exceed the calories expended due to the small metabolism increase related to the ingestion of the MCTs and caffeine.What's more, certain medical conditions like gallbladder issues or pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) may make it necessary to limit your fat intake (20, 21).Coconut oil is much more effective when you use it to replace less healthy fats in your diet, such as those from processed foods, rather than on top of the fats you're currently consuming.Summary Adding coconut oil to coffee can offer some health benefits. Still, it has potential drawbacks, such as replacing a more nutritious meal and adding too many calories. Plus, certain medical conditions may make it necessary to limit your fat intake.If you want to try coconut oil in your cup of joe, start small by adding 1 tablespoon (14 grams) to hot coffee and stirring it thoroughly to ensure that the oil incorporates well. Some people prefer to blend the oil with coffee in a blender to make a delicious tropical-style beverage.Eventually, you can work your way up to 2 tablespoons (28 grams) of coconut oil if you would like to increase your fat intake. This may be most appropriate for those attempting to reach and maintain ketosis.Avoid adding too much coconut oil too quickly, especially if you follow a low- to moderate-fat diet, as it may cause nausea and laxative-like symptoms.Besides, 2 tablespoons (28 grams) is plenty to reap the health benefits of this tasty, healthy fat (22, 23).Summary Start by adding 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of coconut oil to your hot coffee. You can slowly work your way up to twice as much. Note that adding too much coconut oil too quickly may cause unpleasant side effects.If you're watching your calorie or fat intake for medical or personal reasons, avoid putting coconut oil into your coffee. Still, if you follow a ketogenic diet or want to include this healthy fat in your diet, then adding it to your coffee can be an easy way to increase your intake.To avoid unpleasant side effects, start slowly and add no more than 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of coconut oil at first.",https://t.co/S4LfCiNq8y,others
Double Chocolate Muffins,"On the weekend I was thinking about making Cranberry Walnut Breakfast Muffins but I was craving something chocolate-y and didn't want something as cake-like as the Chocolate Quinoa Cupcakes (I reserve those for birthdays and special occasions), so I dreamed up these Double Chocolate Muffins!I totally got my chocolate fix and felt super good about my healthy, hearty and fulfilling muffin that I slathered with Sunbutter.Truth be told I didn't manage to eat more than 4 or 5 of them because Vienna and Walker gobbled them up pretty fast (although I love when that happens because it's proof that the recipe was a success). That being said, I did get the last one when no one was looking and had it with a Rise &amp; Shine Tea latte ! I've kept that secret to myself until just now. And since Vienna will be none the wiser (she can't read yet), and Walker probably won't read this blog post (haha!), the secret is safe with you and me right? These muffins are so easy to make, I'm going to whip up another batch right after I hit publish on this blog post. Baked goods are the easiest recipes to create with a toddler because you don't have to worry about sharp knives and it's fun for kids to dump in all the ingredients and stir.Vienna loves helping me in the kitchen, and it's such a special time for us. Cooking together with kids is an amazing way to foster a positive relationship with food. I remember making peanut butter cookies with my mom like it was yesterday! (I also remember licking the batter off the spoon when she wasn't looking ;)Look at that chocolate-y batter (and that sweet smile)! Now if I was making these just for myself and Walker, I would've added more raw cacao. But since Vienna's eating them, too, I didn't want them to be over-stimulating for her. As you might have read in my Superfoods for Kids post, raw cacao is not a food you want to give babies (at all) and little ones (in small amounts) because of the fact it has natural substances like caffeine and theobromine that are super energizing.I made these ""mini"" because it's just easier for little ones to handle (and also means I can eat a few at a time)! If you bake them in a standard size muffin tin you'll just have to adjust the baking time to be a few minutes longer.You'll notice I used Camino chocolate chips this time. While I usually use Enjoy Life, these have a little less sugar and I actually find them to have a richer chocolate taste.These Double Chocolate Muffins are gluten-free, dairy-free and packed with goodness from almond flour and oats, which makes them blood sugar balancing, satiating and fibre-rich (plus, your microbes will love them too). Here's my new recipe for Double Chocolate Muffins!DessertsDouble Chocolate Muffins PrintIngredients1 cup almond flour (or almond meal)1 cup oats (oat flakes, old-fashioned or quick oats)1/4 cup raw cacao powder1 tsp ea. baking soda and baking powder1 tsp ground cinnamon2 eggs1/2 cup maple syrup1/4 cup melted coconut oil3 tbsp non-dairy milk1/3-1/2 cup chocolate chips*1/4 cup dried cranberriesInstructionsPreheat oven to 350F (180 C). Grease a mini muffin tin or line with paper cups.In a large mixing bowl, stir together almond flour, oats, raw cacao, baking soda &amp; powder, cinnamon.In a separate bowl, combine eggs, maple syrup, coconut oil and non-dairy milk. Let the coconut oil cool slightly before combining otherwise it will cook the egg.Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Fold in chocolate chips and dried cranberries.Bake for 10 minutes or until a fork inserted comes out clean.Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months.Notes*Up to you how chocolate-y you want it :)Makes over 2 dozen mini muffins.If you came here looking for a nut-free muffin, try these ones instead: Coconut Flour Banana Spice Muffins. When you try these, please comment below and let me know what you think!Have a joyous rest of your week!Joy xo",https://t.co/GENNfAUDaU,others

"Eating avocado has many health benefits, but not if you eat it on toast warn researchers","Avocados are great for your diet - but not on toast, nutrition researchers say. It may sound obvious. Bread, a demonized processed carb, has essentially piggybacked superfood starlet avocado to be accepted, even revered, by clean-eating evangelists. Even the most devout avo-toasters know avocado is the Cher to bread's Sonny, nutrition-wise. But this new study, by researchers at the Illinois Institute of Technology's Center for Nutrition Research, was designed to see whether fat is beneficial for weight loss and diabetes risk in obese and overweight people, as recent research suggests. And, if so, how do you best capture its effects? Studying 31 people with a BMI over 30, they found the buttery fruit worked well as a replacement for processed carbs like bread and pasta, suppressing hunger and fueling weight loss for hours, reports DailyMail.com. It also had a remarkable effect controlling insulin resistance and blood glucose in 31 overweight and obese adults. Paired with toast, its effects were not strong, but using whole or half Hass avocados as the primary 'filler' of a meal, rather than a carb, did wonders for health. Why are we so confused about carbs and fats? Carbs and fats have lived together in both harmony and dissonance for decades. Avocado toast, oil-drenched potato chips and fries, ricotta-soaked spaghetti all have a crave appeal - creamy with a bite to it, and perpetually more-ish. Recent research suggests the man-made combination, which is incredibly rare and largely non-existent in natural foods, ignites something in our brains, triggering a rewarding burst of dopamine. But starting in the 1960s, a decades-long debate arose: is fat Since humans started dieting in the 19th century, we have been desperately analyzing our food to weed out the foods to blame for our belly, thigh and arm fat. In 1967, a research paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine was the first to identify fat as the culprit. Now we know that fat is complex, with some bad ones (like trans fats found in oil), some OK fats (saturated ones, found in meat and dairy, which are fine for most, but not for those with cholesterol issues), and some good ones (unsaturated fats, found in avocados and nuts). We also know that the early anti-fat studies were funded by the Sugar Research Foundation in a campaign to make sugar sound healthier than fat. These days, the pendulum has swung, and carbs are now the demon. A study in August 2017 found cutting down on carbs and boosting fat intake led to a longer and healthier life-giving fuel to the 'keto diet' trend, which so many celebrities promote. But then another study, published a year later, found low-carb diets could lower your life expectancy. Dr Britt Burton-Freeman, lead author of the new study, said this research may not answer the low-carb/high-carb question, but certainly shows that people wanting to keep their hunger, blood sugar, and insulin resistance under control should consider skipping the bread. 'For years, fats have been targeted as the main cause of obesity, and now carbohydrates have come under scrutiny for their role in appetite regulation and weight control. 'There is no 'one size fits all' solution when it comes to optimal meal composition for managing appetite. 'However, understanding the relationship between food chemistry and its physiological effects in different populations can reveal opportunities for addressing appetite control and reducing rates of obesity, putting us a step closer to personalized dietary recommendations.'",https://t.co/tei5lkP8qz,others

50 Best Foods for Diabetes,"For most of us, dialing back on sugar and simple carbs is an effective way to fast-track weight loss. But for those living with diabetes, it can be a matter of life and death.Diabetics are two to four times more likely than people without diabetes to die of heart disease or experience a life-threatening stroke, according to the American Heart Association. And for those who don't properly control their condition, the odds of health issues—which range from cardiovascular trouble to nerve damage and kidney disease—increases exponentially.Luckily there are plenty of delicious foods that are compatible with diabetes. We tapped registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators for their top food picks that are low-carb and low-sugar, but still high in flavor. These superfoods will keep your blood sugar in check without skimping on flavor.

""With the fiber and protein combination found in quinoa, you'll feel fuller and have better blood sugar control. Protein also helps with the uptake of carbohydrates so the body can process them more easily. I suggest enjoying quinoa in a salad or casserole."" ShutterstockElizabeth Snyder, RD, LD, CDE says you can still eat carbs if you're diabetic. You just have to watch out for portion sizes: ""The trouble [with eating carbs as a diabetic] lies in eating more carbohydrates than we need, as the body will choose to store any extra energy as fat,"" she says. So, rather of cutting out carbs entirely, Snyder recommends switching to complex carbs, such as 100% whole wheat bread, which are higher in vitamins, minerals, and blood-sugar-managing fiber than their simple, refined counterparts. Shutterstock""Beans provide a notable combination of plant protein and soluble fiber that can help boost feelings of fullness and manage blood sugar levels,"" Jackie Newgent, RDN, culinary nutritionist, and author of The All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook explains. ""Replacing some meat with beans can play a helpful role in heart health,"" which is particularly important for diabetics as heart disease is one of the most common complications of diabetes. Consider adding kidney beans to soups and black beans to your casseroles to boost your intake of the legumes. ShutterstockLentils are rich in something called resistant starch: a type of carb that has a very minimal impact on your blood sugar levels because it passes through the body undigested and ultimately ends up feeding the healthy bacteria at the bottom of your digestive tract.

Here's why: ""It's a healthy protein source that will not raise blood sugar levels and will help to decrease the risk of heart disease and stroke—a major concern for diabetics."" Salmon's heart-healthy qualities come from its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. This particular fat reduces levels of triglycerides, a risk factor for coronary heart disease, according to a review in the journal Endocrine Practice. ShutterstockLooking for a protein-packed way to fuel your morning? Greek yogurt is the answer. ""It naturally contains both carbohydrates and protein, which is a perfect combination to help control hunger levels and blood sugars,"" says Koszyk. ""Plus, choosing Greek yogurt will give you more protein and fewer carbohydrates than regular yogurt, which can help better control blood-sugar levels. Enjoy yogurt in a smoothie or as a snack paired with some berries and chia seeds."" Shutterstock""Leafy greens, like spinach, are great non-starchy vegetable options because they contain lutein, an important nutrient for eye health. This nutrient is essential for people with diabetes since they have a higher risk for blindness than those without diabetes,"" explains Newgent. That's not all spinach has going for it. A study published in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine found that adults who consumed 4,069 milligrams of potassium per day had a 37 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to those who consumed only 1,793 milligrams. Just one cup of cooked spinach contains 839 milligrams of potassium (which is equivalent to what's in 2 medium bananas) or 20 percent of that target intake. ShutterstockCraving a treat?

""Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries are all low on the glycemic index and are considered to be superfoods for diabetics,"" Koszyk explains. The combination of being low in sugar and high in fiber contributes to their diabetes-friendly ability to gradually raise blood sugars. An added bonus: according to two recent animal studies, consuming a diet rich in polyphenols—a naturally occurring chemical found abundantly in berries—can decrease the formation of fat cells by up to 73 percent! Shutterstock""Cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts and cabbage are high in something called sulforaphane,"" Miriam Jacobson, RD, CDN says. ""The compound helps reduce oxidative stress and vascular complications associated with diabetes like heart disease and neuropathy, a term used to describe a problem with the nerves."" ShutterstockAdd a satisfying crunch to your favorite oatmeal, salad, soup, or smoothie with the help of ground flaxseeds, a potent superfood for people with diabetes. ""Ground flaxseeds contain lignans (a plant-based chemical compound) and fiber which help maintain blood sugar levels and glycemic control,"" Koszyk explains. Shutterstock""I often recommend an ounce of almonds as a snack,"" Zanini tells us. ""Almonds don't raise blood sugar levels and are a great source of magnesium, a nutrient that improves insulin sensitivity."" Shutterstock""Chia seeds are a heart-healthy fat that contains fiber and omega-3s,"" Koszyk explains. ""Research suggests that chia seeds help control blood glucose. And it's all thanks to the fiber content slowing the passage of glucose into the blood. Also, fiber fills us up which reduces our appetite and helps us eat less."" Koszyk suggests enjoying chia seeds in yogurt, fruit and veggie smoothies, or salads. ShutterstockWhat's better than avocado toast? Perhaps it's the fact that this fatty fruit can help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels. ""Avocados contain a significant amount of healthful fats and dietary fiber, which help slow carbohydrate digestion and absorption and prevent spikes in blood sugar,"" Newgent tells us. ShutterstockIt's time to upgrade your cooking oil. Extra virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, which studies show can actually help lower levels of 'bad' LDL cholesterol. This is particularly important since diabetics have a higher risk of experiencing a heart attack or stroke. And get this: Snyder says losing just 7 percent of your body weight (if you're overweight) can result in significant health benefits for diabetics. Luckily for you, EVOO is rich in oleic acid, which a Journal of Lipid Research study found helps reduce lipogenesis, or fat formation. Shutterstock""When living with diabetes, eating a filling breakfast is an essential way to start the day,"" says Erin Spitzberg, MS, RDN, CDE, and author of Eat Like a Normal Person. ""Adding a little fat for added satiety can help,"" she explains. She recommends pairing up your favorite breakfast carb—either a slice of whole grain toast, bowl of steel-cut oats, or high-fiber cereal—with 1 tablespoon of natural peanut butter. ""The peanut butter adds approximately five grams of fat, which will help slow digestion and keep you full a little longer."" ShutterstockKale is called a superfood for good reason! Rich in fiber—with 16 grams, or over 60 percent of your daily recommended intake, of the digestion-slowing nutrient in just one cup—and low on the glycemic index, kale can help improve blood glucose control. ShutterstockDespite what you may think, nixing sugar or salt doesn't have to be synonymous with bland, cardboard-like dishes. ""So often, we think about what we can't eat when we start cutting out sugar. Instead, focus on ways to add more flavor to the foods you are eating,"" suggests Zanini. ""There are so many great ways to add flavor without adding sugar or salt."" Add a couple crushed cloves of garlic to your marinara sauce or saute broccoli in a blend of extra virgin olive oil, chopped garlic, and crushed red pepper flakes. ShutterstockA series of reviews printed in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition discovered that adding a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon to a starchy meal like overnight oats could help stabilize blood sugar, ward off insulin spikes, and decrease fasting blood sugar. Experts believe that the spice's powerful antioxidants, known as polyphenols, are at work; these active compounds have been proven to improve insulin sensitivity and, in turn, your body's ability to store fat and manage hunger cues. ShutterstockWant to continue munching on your favorite crackers without fretting too much over your blood sugar levels? Consider pairing the crunchy snack with a can of tuna. Depending on the amount of healthy fats and protein you pair with your carb-laden snack, your body can digest the carbs much slower than you could if you ate the carbs alone. In fact, Tufts University researchers recently presented the results of a study which found that eating protein- and fat-rich tuna fish with a slice of white bread produced a slower rise in blood sugar than when eating carbs alone. Sergey GavrikYour favorite grilled veggie is more than just a tasty side. Because asparagus is rich in folate—just four spears contain 89 micrograms of the nutrient, or roughly 22 percent of your recommended daily value—it's a great carb for those living with diabetes. According to a meta-analysis published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, folic acid supplementation can lower cardiovascular risk among patients with Type 2 diabetes by reducing homocysteine levels, an amino acid that's been linked to increased risk of mortality when present in high levels in diabetic patients. ShutterstockTrust us: it's worth the tears. A Canadian study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition discovered that a type of gut-healthy insoluble fiber found in onions, called oligofructose, can increase levels of ghrelin—a hormone that controls hunger—and lower levels of blood sugar. This allium can help diabetics in another way, as well. Thanks to their bioactive sulfur-containing compounds, onions can help lower cholesterol, ward off hardening of the arteries, and help maintain healthy blood pressure levels, according to a study published in the Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine.Pro tip: Eat your onions raw whenever you can for better benefits; a Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry study found the cholesterol-lowering properties were stronger in onions that were raw compared to those eaten cooked. Think: pico de gallo, sliced onions on sandwiches and burgers, or served in a Greek cucumber and tomato salad. Sergey GavrikIf you love spaghetti and meatballs, swapping in veggies for grains should be your go-to move. ""Zucchini noodles and spaghetti squash are both easy and delicious ways to lower the amount of carbohydrates in some of your favorite dishes,"" says Zanini. ShutterstockZanini is a huge fan of green tea—and with good reason. Because it is hydrating and filling, green tea can help prevent overeating, which will both stabilize blood sugar levels and aid weight loss efforts by boosting feelings of satiety. ""This drink also increases your metabolism and reduces fat storage,"" Zanini adds. Shutterstock""Oats contain a type of fiber called beta-glucan, which seems to have an anti-diabetic effect,"" explains Newgent. Specifically, a review published in Vascular Health and Risk Management concluded that beta-glucans help to reduce high blood sugar and blood pressure, adding, ""I advise people with diabetes to steer clear of added sugars by enjoying savory rather than sweet oatmeal."" Try making oatmeal overnight with one of our overnight oats recipes for weight loss. ShutterstockCheck out the power of the cauliflower. Grate it up, and cauliflower rice is a great low-carb substitute for refined white rice, which can help keep your blood sugar levels more stable. Plus, cauliflower is rich in sulforaphane: a compound which a Science Translational Medicine study found can inhibit glucose production in cells and improves glucose tolerance in rodents on high-fat or high-fructose diet. ShutterstockYou may not think much of broccoli sprouts when they pop up on your salad or sandwich, but these little guys are a powerful anti-inflammatory. They're packed with sulforaphane, which may help protect against cancer according to a study published in Cancer Prevention Research. Rich in fiber, broccoli sprouts are ""a potent detoxifier and play a role in decreasing cancer risk,"" says Nicole Anziani, MS, RD, CDN, CDE and Clinical Manager at Fit4D. Shutterstock""Edamame delivers a unique nutrition profile that could offer multiple benefits for those living with diabetes,"" Jenna Braddock, RDN, CSSD, sports dietitian and blogger at MakeHealthyEasy. ""First, the fiber content of one cup is a staggering 10 grams, which could be very helpful in regulating blood sugar spikes and also contributes to reducing risk for heart disease. Second, as a plant-based source of protein, it could help reduce disease risk factors when it replaces meat in the diet. Lastly, edamame is a good source of the essential nutrient choline, and research shows that 9 out of ten Americans don't get enough of in the diet. Choline is important for helping to reduce homocysteine levels in the blood, a marker connected to increased risk of heart disease and connected to vascular disease in diabetes."" ShutterstockInstead of reaching for pretzels, chips, or another high-carb, high-calorie snack, carrots make for a healthy, low-calorie alternative. They are packed with vitamins C, D, E, and K, and the antioxidant beta-carotene, and make for a good low-carb snack when dunked in hummus or guacamole. ShutterstockEggs are a great source of protein. Anziani recommends opting for pasture-raised, organic omega-3 eggs. ""The yolk will concentrate the omega-3 fed to the chickens,"" she says, adding that these eggs are ""a good source of choline and protein, but limit to under five per week."" ShutterstockInstead of choosing starchier veggies that can raise blood sugar, Anziani likes tomatoes to add to a salad or as a snack for a flavorful option that's low-calorie. They are also a good source of the antioxidant lycopene, which can help fight inflammation. ShutterstockThese fatty fish are some of the healthiest cold water fish, says Anziani. ""[Sardines are] extremely convenient to eat when packaged as boneless and skinless in extra virgin olive oil,"" she says. Pour them over a salad with the olive oil dressing for a boost of healthy fats and protein to keep your blood sugar stable. ShutterstockInstead of fattier cheese or mayo, Anziani recommends hummus as a dip for veggies or low-carb crackers. ""[Hummus] contains protein and a lot of taste for lower glycemic snacking,"" she says. ShutterstockAlthough vegetarians might have a tougher time getting protein in their diet, Anziani recommends organic tofu which absorbs the flavor of whatever it is cooked with. Another tofu option is tempeh, a fermented soy protein that can replace animal protein. However, those with a thyroid condition should only consume tofu or tempeh two to three times a week. ShutterstockAnziani says that although sweet potatoes are starchy, they're rich in beta-carotene, which is converted into the essential vitamin A. Sweet potatoes are also lower on the glycemic index than regular white potatoes. Treat sweet potatoes as your main starch for the meal and stick to a serving size—about ½ a cup baked or roasted. Keep the skin on for extra fiber. ShutterstockMCT oil, named for the medium-chain triglycerides, a type of fatty acids, has been praised for its brain-boosting benefits, but it can also be used in small amounts to replace other fat sources. ""MCT oil can be used in smoothies or drizzled over salads,"" Anziani says, ""It is tasteless and may be used as fuel preferentially, versus being stored as fat."" ShutterstockStock up on fresh pumpkin and pumpkin puree during the fall season. This super squash is rich in beta-carotene and adds a boost of seasonal flavor. ""Can be a nice addition to oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, or cooked as the starch component of dinner,"" Anziani says. ShutterstockWatching your blood sugar doesn't mean you have to give up dessert entirely. Dark chocolate that's 70% cacao or above can have health benefits without spiking blood sugar; just pay attention to the ingredients and nutrition label. ""One ounce or square can be consumed per day to strategically lower the stress hormone cortisol and keep milk chocolate cravings at bay,"" Anziani, says. Cacao is also rich in antioxidants, which can help fight inflammation. ShutterstockEven diabetics can enjoy pasta. Shirataki noodles are made from yam flour for a low-carb and super low-calorie option. ""These noodles have 0-20 calories per package and can be prepared in meals that would call for carby noodles,"" Anziani says. Shutterstock""All vegetables are good sources of nutrition but dark green leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, bok choy, mustard, and broccoli provide vitamins like A, C, E, K and folate as well as fiber, iron and several minerals like calcium,"" Byron Richard, MS RD CDE, Clinical Nutrition Manager UC San Diego Health, says, ""Leafy greens, as most non-starchy vegetables, have a low GI are low in calories and carbohydrates."" ShutterstockCelery is an alkaline food that makes for an easy snack; Anziani likes that celery is nearly calorie-free. Slice up some celery to dip in hummus or fill with almond or peanut butter. ShutterstockSmoothies, especially those with a lot of fruit, can have too much sugar for diabetics. But a good high-quality, low-sugar vegan protein powder can be an excellent meal replacement when shaken with unsweetened almond or coconut milk says Anziani. We like Vega One All-In-One Nutritional Shake Blend ($51.99 for large tun on Amazon). It clocks in at just 137 calories per scoop with 11 grams of carbs, 2 grams of sugar, 6 grams of fiber and 15 grams of protein. Blend a low-sugar smoothie with spinach, chia seeds, unsweetened almond milk, and a handful of berries for sweetness. ShutterstockBitter melons aren't all that common; after all, as the name suggests, they are very bitter, Anziani says. However, she adds that it has been proven to lower blood sugar. A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology found that 2,000 mg of bitter melon a day lowers blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. ShutterstockInstead of sodas and sweetened beverages, which can pack up to 40 grams of sugar per serving and can wreak havoc on blood sugar levels, Anziani recommends opting for unsweetened seltzer instead. Try a low-calorie flavored brand like Spindrift, or buy plain club soda or seltzer and flavor yourself with a squeeze of lemon, lime, or fresh mint sprigs. ShutterstockNuts are an excellent snack for diabetics since they are low in carbs, high in healthy fats, and high in fiber. Walnuts are one of the best nuts available because of their high omega-3 content Anziani says—one serving (about ¼ a cup) has almost 3 grams of omega-3s. Just be sure to stick to one serving size so as not to go overboard on calories. ShutterstockLike other beans, chickpeas are a high-fiber legume that can be eaten instead of animal protein, Anziani recommends. Roasted and seasoned chickpeas also make for a good high-fiber, low-carb snack compared to other high glycemic options such as pretzels and potato chips. ShutterstockInstead of other high-carb crackers, opt for high-fiber flax crackers. They're an excellent base for hummus, guacamole, or turkey slices. We like Mary's Gone Crackers Super Seed Crackers which are just 160 calories per serving and have 19 grams of carbs, 3 grams of fiber, 0 grams of sugar, and 3 grams of protein. ShutterstockBone broth is rich in collagen, which can make for a protein-packed and satiating snack. a low sodium protein-rich beverage rich in collagen Anziani says. Sip some warm broth for an afternoon snack to keep you satisfied until dinnertime. We like Pacific Foods for a tasty and affordable option. ShutterstockCombining lean proteins are key in keeping your blood sugar down while also leaving you feeling satisfied. Anziani recommends lean chicken because it's nearly pure protein, highly satiating, and versatile for a variety of recipes. ""A good portion of protein is a palm-sized piece at meals, or about 22 grams per meal,"" she says. ShutterstockYou don't have to give up rice entirely if you're diabetic. Anziani likes wild rice because it's high in fiber. She says it's an ancient grain that is actually a grass and is high in manganese, zinc, iron, and folate. ShutterstockRed, green, orange, and yellow bell peppers aren't just colorful additions to your salad; they can be a blood sugar-friendly snack all on their own. They have a sweeter taste without the sugar content of most fruit (about 3 grams of sugar per medium bell pepper). Anziani also likes how they are rich in vitamin C and also have a satisfying crunch. Slice them up and enjoy them as a snack with hummus or guacamole.

Ceylon vs Cassia - Not All Cinnamon Is Created Equal,"Healthline and our partners may receive a portion of revenues if you make a purchase using a link on this page.Cinnamon is a very popular spice.Not only is it delicious, its many health benefits are also impressive.Cinnamon is cheap and widely available in most supermarkets. At least, one type is.Most people don't realize there are actually two main types of this spice.Both of them are healthy, but one contains a toxin that is harmful if you eat too much of it.This article explains the differences between Ceylon and Cassia cinnamon. Cinnamon is a spice created from the inner bark of the Cinnamomum tree.Strips of the inner bark are dried until they curl into rolls known as cinnamon sticks or quills. These can then be ground into powder or made into an extract.The unique properties of this spice come from its essential oils and compounds, particularly cinnamaldehyde (1). This compound gives cinnamon its flavor and aroma, and is also responsible for many of its health benefits. Bottom Line: Cinnamon is made from the inner bark of the Cinnamomum tree. Its unique properties come from its essential oils, such as cinnamaldehyde. Cassia cinnamon comes from the Cinnamomum cassia tree, also called Cinnamomum aromaticum. It originated in Southern China and is also known as Chinese cinnamon.However, there are several subspecies now widely grown across Eastern and Southern Asia (2). Cassia tends to be a dark brown-red color with thicker sticks and a rougher texture than Ceylon cinnamon.Cassia cinnamon is considered lower quality. It is very cheap and is the type most commonly consumed around the world. Almost all cinnamon found in supermarkets is the Cassia variety.Cassia has long been used in cooking and in traditional Chinese medicine. Roughly 95% of its oil is cinnamaldehyde, which gives Cassia a very strong, spicy flavor (3).Bottom Line: Cassia cinnamon is the most common variety. It has a stronger flavor than Ceylon and 95% of its oil is cinnamaldehyde. Ceylon, or ""true cinnamon,"" is native to Sri Lanka and southern parts of India.It's made from the inner bark of the Cinnamomum verum tree.Ceylon is tan-brown in color and contains many tight sticks with soft layers. These features provide a highly desirable quality and texture.Ceylon cinnamon is less common and has long been prized as a cooking spice. It is quite expensive compared to the more common Cassia variety.It's described as having a delicate and mildly sweet flavor suitable for desserts. Approximately 50–63% of its essential oil is cinnamaldehyde, which is quite low compared to Cassia. This explains its milder aroma and flavor (3).Bottom Line: Ceylon cinnamon is a high-quality, highly prized spice. Between 50–63% of its oil is cinnamaldehyde, which explains its mild flavor. For generations, cinnamon has been prized for its health properties.In particular, it's been claimed to benefit blood sugar control, which is important for people with diabetes.A review of 16 previous studies on diabetes treatment found promising results for Ceylon powder that was used as a supplement (4). Animal and lab studies show it may reduce blood sugar spikes, increase insulin sensitivity and improve metabolic markers associated with insulin resistance (4).Unfortunately, there aren't any human studies to determine the effectiveness or optimal dosage of Ceylon cinnamon supplements.On the other hand, Cassia has been used in several studies of humans with and without type 2 diabetes. Most of these observed significant reductions in fasting blood sugar levels within several months of use (5, 6, 7).The standard dose of Cassia was between 1–6 grams per day. It had minimal side effects, or none at all.Bottom Line: Both the Ceylon and Cassia varieties appear to have anti-diabetic and blood sugar lowering effects. However, Cassia has been better studied in humans. Ceylon and Cassia likely have slightly different health properties.This is because their essential oil ratios are somewhat different.However, the current published studies have not attempted to make this distinction.For example, several of cinnamon's bioactive compounds appear to block a protein called tau from accumulating in the brain. This is important, as tau buildup is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (8, 9, 10).However, this effect has been observed using both Ceylon and Cassia cinnamon. Therefore, it's unclear if one is superior to the other in this regard. Overall, it's not possible to say which one has more health benefits. However, Ceylon has far less potential to cause harm when consumed regularly.Bottom Line: No research has compared the health benefits of Ceylon and Cassia cinnamon. Coumarin is a compound found naturally in several plant species.It can be harmful in large doses.In rodents, coumarin is known to cause kidney, liver and lung damage. It may even cause cancer. In humans, there are isolated incidents of similar effects (11, 12). In fact, the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of coumarin used to be 0.2 mg/lb (0.5 mg/kg) of body weight. It has now been reduced to 0.05 mg/lb (0.1 mg/kg) (11).Cassia cinnamon, but not Ceylon, is a very rich source of coumarin.Cassia contains approximately 1% coumarin, while Ceylon contains only 0.004%, or 250 times less. This is so low that it's often undetectable (3, 13). Exceeding the upper limit for coumarin is easily possible if you are consuming a lot of Cassia cinnamon. In many cases, just 1-2 teaspoons could bring someone over the daily limit.Therefore, if you regularly eat a lot of cinnamon or take a supplement that contains it, then it should be Ceylon and not Cassia.Bottom Line: Cassia contains a lot of coumarin, which can be toxic in large quantities. It is much safer to choose Ceylon if you eat a lot of cinnamon. Both Ceylon and Cassia are healthy and delicious.However, if you intend to consume large amounts of this spice or take a supplement, Cassia can be harmful because of the coumarin content.At the end of the day, Ceylon cinnamon is better quality and much safer.",https://t.co/1wbbWsk3oD,others

6 Reasons to Exercise Before Breakfast with Diabetes,"For as long as I can remember my alarm clock has gone off long before sunrise.You might be wondering: Why would I choose do to something so crazy?My answer: I wake up in the wee hours of the morning to exercise. In my experience, I have come to learn that when I exercise before the start of my workday I often have a better day overall.It turns out that fitting in an early morning workout (especially if it is done before breakfast) has several health benefits in comparison to working out later in the day.Stick to the habitThere's a good chance that if you exercise in the morning, you will be more likely to stick with the habit. Once your day begins a variety of distractions and/or obligations (work meetings, caring for a child or elderly relative, social events, etc.) can pull you in various directions making it more challenging to get to the gym for an evening exercise session.Be better prepared to learn and focusExercise creates ""an environment in which the brain is ready, willing, and able to learn.""1Morning exercise, in addition to priming the brain to learn, also helps improve focus for the entirety of the day.2 This can be especially helpful for surviving long work meetings and meeting pressing deadlines.Improve your blood glucose controlFor those of you with prediabetes or diabetes working out in the morning may help you to lower your blood sugar throughout the day. In a recent article written by Yardly and Coldberg, it was reported that, ""performing exercise in the fasting state resulted in better postprandial glycemic profiles over the following 24 hours than exercise performed post breakfast.""3Reduce risk of hypoglycemiaIf your diabetes has progressed to the point of insulin dependence, you may be concerned about having a low blood glucose. As both exercise and insulin injections can result in hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). This may be of particular concern if you exercise in the late afternoon or early evening hours or if you exercise soon after taking an injection of rapid-acting insulin. By exercising in the morning, before breakfast, there may be a reduced risk for hypoglycemia (especially overnight) in comparison to afternoon/evening exercise.3Lose more fat and reduce insulin resistanceExercising before breakfast, in the fasted state, allows for greater fat breakdown. Breaking down more fat (losing fat) helps to improve insulin sensitivity.4Improved sleepThe increase in energy gained from early morning workout results in, ""a natural decrease in energy throughout the day.""5 So when it's time to go to bed, you are more likely to get to sleep faster and have a better night of rest.Tips to get out of bed in the morning to exerciseIf you are not accustomed to working out in the morning, I promise you it gets easier! Here are some of my tips for getting out of bed before the sun comes up: Set out your workout clothes for the night beforePrep your coffee (if you can set a timer for your coffee to be ready when you wake up that's even better)Recruit some friends to meet up with you for an early morning walk. This will help keep you (and your friends) accountable.Take a group fitness class. This will help eliminate the question: ""What should I do at the gym today?""Set an alarm clock that requires you to get out of bed to turn it off.

7 Impressive Benefits of Yacon,"The health benefits of yacon include its ability to regulate blood sugar levels, lower ""bad"" cholesterol, help with weight loss, lower blood pressure, improve the health of the liver, boost digestive health, and strengthen the immune system.What is Yacon?Yacon is a large perennial plant that is mainly grown and cultivated for its tuberous roots. The scientific name of yacon is Smallanthus sonchifolius and it primarily grows in South America, including the Central and Northern Andes, which primarily fall in Colombia and Argentina. It has been a traditionally grown vegetable for thousands of years and has a wide variety of uses. Yacon syrup and powder are commonly used as healthy replacements for sugar as sweeteners in various foods. Furthermore, the root can be eaten raw, like a potato or a jicama. The majority of the density of these vegetable tubes, which can grow up to 1 kilogram in weight, are fructooligosaccharides, which is an indigestible form of fructose. This unique quality of yacon is part of what makes it so valuable.This vegetable wasn't widely known outside of its native range until recent decades but is also cultivated in Australia and New Zealand, with its popularity spreading to Japan, China, South Korea, and even in the healthy food markets of the United States.You can harvest yacon after the rhizomes at the top of the plant die and fall back, meaning that the tube underneath the ground is ready to be eaten. One of the best things about yacon is that it can easily be grown in home gardens and requires very little expertise or farming experience. The juicy meat of the tuber is slightly sweet, thanks to the fructose-based composition.The leaves of the plant also contain a variety of beneficial organic compounds, which is why yacon tea and syrup have become valuable and sought after components to add to people's diets. In fact, yacon syrup has had a recent surge of popularity, as it is claimed to not only be a superfood for diabetics, but also for people trying to lose weight. However, the question remains: Why is yacon considered so important for our health?Nutrition FactsORGANIC YACON SYRUP, UPC: 845772170502Serving Size : 100 g1 Tbsp (15 g)NutrientValueEnergy &amp;lsqb;kcal&amp;rsqb;133Protein &amp;lsqb;g&amp;rsqb;0Total lipid (fat) &amp;lsqb;g&amp;rsqb;0Carbohydrate, by difference &amp;lsqb;g&amp;rsqb;73.33Fiber, total dietary &amp;lsqb;g&amp;rsqb;0Sugars, total &amp;lsqb;g&amp;rsqb;46.67Calcium, Ca &amp;lsqb;mg&amp;rsqb;0Iron, Fe &amp;lsqb;mg&amp;rsqb;0Sodium, Na &amp;lsqb;mg&amp;rsqb;87Vitamin C, total ascorbic acid &amp;lsqb;mg&amp;rsqb;0Vitamin A, IU &amp;lsqb;IU&amp;rsqb;0Fatty acids, total saturated &amp;lsqb;g&amp;rsqb;0Fatty acids, total trans &amp;lsqb;g&amp;rsqb;0Cholesterol &amp;lsqb;mg&amp;rsqb;0 Sources include : USDANutritional Value of YaconAs mentioned, yacon tubers are mostly composed of fructooligosaccharides and water. This means that the majority of the carbohydrate sugars cannot be digested by the body, resulting in a very low-calorie level and a prevention of excess sugar coming into the bloodstream. Yacon also helps the body increase its vitamin and mineral absorption of all other foods, so while there aren't many vitamins and minerals in yacon itself, it is very important for the intake of these essential components of human health. That being said, yacon is still rich in potassium, calcium, and phosphorous.Health Benefits of YaconThe health benefits of yacon include its ability to regulate blood sugar levels, monitor cholesterol, and aid in weight loss, among others.Prevents DiabetesThe reason that so many people around the world have begun to use yacon so often is its anti-hyperglycemic effects. The fructooligosaccharides in yacon mean that the body does not absorb any simple sugars; in fact, it lowers the amount of glucose production in the liver and causes a shift to lower fasting glucose rates. This is very important for people suffering from diabetes. Research is also being done on yacon's potential to increase insulin sensitivity in the body, yet another beneficial aspect for diabetics, or for people at risk of developing the disease.Regulates Blood PressureThere are a number of heart-healthy aspects to yacon, but the high levels of potassium are certainly worth mentioning first. Potassium is a vasodilator, meaning that it relaxes blood vessels and reduces strain on the cardiovascular system. This means increased blood flow and oxygenation to parts of the body that need it most, and a reduced chance of developing conditions like atherosclerosis, or suffering from heart conditions like heart attacks or strokes. Potassium also helps to regulate the fluid balance in our body's cells and tissues, in conjunction with sodium.Controls Cholesterol LevelsAside from its benefits to diabetics, yacon is also important for people who need to control their cholesterol. Research has shown that consuming yacon results in a general lowering of fasting triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein levels. In other words, the fructooligosaccharides that compose yacon help to lower lipid levels and prevent the accumulation of ""bad"" cholesterol. This aids in the prevention of a wide variety of heart concerns, including coronary heart disease.Weight LossAlthough this has been hotly debated in certain circles, various researchers claim that eating yacon can help increase weight loss. Since it is not composed of starch (like most tubers), but fills you up, and has a very low level of calories, it is thought to result in overall weight loss. This can also be caused by the slight laxative effect of yacon (perhaps due to its fiber content) and the increased satiety that people feel after eating this sweet plant.Improves DigestionWhile the body can't absorb these fructooligosaccharides, it doesn't mean that the healthy bacteria in our gut does not find it delicious! Yacon also contain prebiotic materials, stimulating the growth and health of the microflora in our bodies. When our probiotic bacteria are well-taken care of and healthy, our body can maximize its intake of vitamins and minerals. By optimizing the absorption levels of our food, we are able to get more ""bang for our buck"", so to speak, when we eat any other foods. Also, the slight laxative effect of yacon reduces risk of constipation, bloating, and other more serious gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastric ulcers and colon cancer.Liver HealthThe liver is the source of glucose in our body, so it makes sense that regulation of glucose through eating yacon would affect our liver health in some way. In fact, studies have shown that sufficient amounts of yacon (particularly when combined with milk thistle) prevent fat accumulation in the liver and maintain proper liver health and function.Word of Caution: Although it is rare, there have been some reports of allergies to the yacon root. Furthermore, the leaves should only be used for tea, because they have been found to be slightly toxic to the kidneys when eaten directly. Other than these two small issues, enjoy yacon, as well as all of the wonderful benefits it can bring to your health!",https://t.co/yvGgxCVUBF,others
Cinnamon Raisin Peanut Butter,"Are there foods you just don't enjoy? For me, it's raisins.If there are raisins in my granola, you will no doubt see me meticulously picking them out and setting them on the side of my plate. No, thanks. And my go-to movie theatre snack? It will never be Raisinettes. Yeah, no.However, the one exception I will make is when cinnamon is involved. Anything cinnamon raisin is A-OK in my book. So when I sampled some cinnamon raisin peanut butter recently, I knew it was due time to make my own. I couldn't resist! Let's do this.This 5-ingredient recipe starts with roasted unsalted peanuts. Or, if you can't find unsalted, just omit any additional salt.These bad guys are whirled around until buttery and smooth. Swoon!VIDEOOnce creamy, it's time to add your flavors. We went for a pinch of salt and LOADS of cinnamon. Trust us, 2 Tablespoons seems like a lot, but we started with 1 teaspoon and worked our way up. For some reason, in peanut butter, the cinnamon flavor can get lost, which is why you need so much. Fear not – it's hard to go overboard.And for sweetener, we went with a little stevia and maple syrup. Too much liquid sweetener may cause the peanut butter to seize, which is no bueno. So, to avoid that problem, start with a little liquid sweetener (like maple syrup) and then sweeten more with stevia or powdered cane or coconut sugar to taste.Now it's raisin time! Add your raisins (and a dash more cinnamon) and pulse until combined. Then go to town. It was love at first bite for us.We hope you LOVE this peanut butter! It's:CreamySaltyCinnamonyStudded with raisinsNaturally sweetEasy to make&amp; Insanely deliciousThis would make the perfect spread for toast, crepes, pancakes, waffles, bananas, Banana Splits, oats, smoothies, Coconut Yogurt, cookies, and more!If you're into this nut butter, also be sure to check out our Super Seedy Sunflower Butter, Almond Joy Butter, and our Guide to Making Nut Butters!If you try this recipe, let us know!

If using maple syrup, start with 1 Tbsp (15 ml). Adding more than that amount may cause the mixture to seize (liquid and fat don't mix well), which is why we recommend a little stevia and a little maple syrup.Process another 30 seconds to combine. If for some reason your peanut butter doesn't get smooth, add a little neutral oil, such as avocado or peanut oil (not coconut, as it will harden).Add raisins and pulse a couple of times until combined. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more cinnamon for intense cinnamon flavor, sweetener for sweetness, or salt for saltiness..Store leftovers at room temperature for 3-4 weeks. For longer-term storage, store in fridge for up to 2 months or more.VIDEONotes*We used common cinnamon (known as cinnamomum cassia). If you use Ceylon cinnamon, you will likely need to add more to achieve the same cinnamon taste, as its flavor is less intense.*Avoid adding more than 1 Tbsp (15 ml) maple syrup (or other liquid sweeteners). Doing so will likely cause the mixture to seize up because the fat of the peanut butter doesn't agree with liquids. Adding 1 Tbsp (15 ml) is safe, but if you prefer a sweeter nut butter, switch to organic powdered sugar, stevia, or another dry sweetener of choice.*Nutrition information is a rough estimate for 1 (2 Tbsp) serving calculated without oil or maple syrup, and with powdered stevia.*Recipe inspired by the Cinnamon Raisin Peanut Butter by Wild Friends!Nutrition Per Serving (1 of 16) Calories: 164 Fat: 13g Saturated fat: 2g Sodium: 38.2mg Carbohydrates: 8.4g Fiber: 2.8g Sugar: 3.2g Protein: 6.5g",https://t.co/FlPqsV76qY,others

healthy blood sugar level summit |,"Meet me and my vision for this summitHi, I am Desiree Arnold, ND, a graduate from the ""Joseph Angerer"" School for Alternative Medicine in Munich Germany in 1994, with over 20 years of experience in the fields of several Natural and Alternative Medical Therapies and Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Nutritional Coaching and Consulting for Chronic and Degenerative Diseases.My vision for this summit is to give people who are at risk for Type 2 Diabetes, and people who have Type 2 Diabetes, their caretakers and family members, an understanding of how Type 2 Diabetes can be prevented, and even reversed.My guests, who are Medical Doctors, Naturopathic Doctors, Practitioners, and Nutritionists will share their expertise on various topics and aspects of Type 2 Diabetes. They will share powerful knowledge that will lift you out of the fear and confusion zone, and give you tools and inspiration to take charge of your health and life. There are as well Super Heroes, who have returned to Healthy Blood Sugar Levels after conventional medicine's only solution was lifelong Medication and long term suffering from the threat of Heart Attack, Strokes, Blindness, and Amputations. And Guess What – They will share with you how they did it!I live in Trinidad and Tobago, where over 12 % of the population know they have Type 2 Diabetes. Unfortunately, there is an additional large number of people who don't even know that they are living with Type 2 Diabetes. Of them, many are women, who plan to get pregnant, have problems conceiving, and additionally give their unborn the inheritance of a challenged pancreas, with an increased risk to develop Diabetes in early childhood.Those who have been diagnosed, don't really know what it means to have Type 2 Diabetes and continue the same lifestyle now with medication, believing it is normal to be on dialysis after a few years, or having to give up toes or even a foot to amputation, go blind or suffer a stroke and heart attack. They are then driven by fear and hopelessness, losing all their health, wealth and quality of life, waiting for death.Having helped over 2 decades patients to understand Type 2 Diabetes, and coached them back to Healthy Blood Sugar Levels, seeing them living with hope and working on getting back their health and joy in life was wonderful, but it is not enough. while I was able to help a hand full of people, too many died, or are chronically ill, unable to live with purpose and enjoy life.In the summit, we also put a great focus on preventing Diabetes in Children, as Children born to Gestational Diabetes and to Type 2 Diabetic Mothers are at a much higher risk to also become diabetic at a very young age.The Healthy Blood Sugar Level Summit 2019 will bring you an understanding of Diabetes and will help you tackle the Cause by its Root, which is Nutrition. Therefor you will receive lots of tips and ideas of how to prepare and plan your meals, stay on a budget and work towards rebuilding your Insulin Sensitivity.My guests will also show you, how to prevent and in many cases reverse long term health risks of diabetes, like heart disease, stroke, amputations, kidney disease, blindness.Just imagine how great it would be, if you or your children can live a life of purpose and joy versus weekly doctor visits, fearing test results, slowing down the rotting effects of diabetes.The solution is right in front of you, and our mission is to help you to take charge of your health, take the driver seat in your life and say goodbye to chronic illness caused by imbalanced blood sugar levels.",https://t.co/H2rkwrjeLv,others

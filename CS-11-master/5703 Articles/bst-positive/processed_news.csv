Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,"" Platt, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,"" Colberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""For example, the message 'seek medical help' is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,"" Colberg added. ""Self-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps."" SOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.",https://t.co/i2PzezDSay,news
Better for Blood Sugar and Won't Hurt Your Gut Like Gluten,"Many nutrition experts, myself included, do not recommend consumption of various kinds of bread on a daily basis.The Reasons:Bread can mess up blood sugar levels – most bread contains Amylopectin-A. It is one of the main components of starch and involved in our metabolism. It places the body in a series of high and low blood glucose. Research has shown that Amylopectin-A may promote the development of insulin-resistance which, over time, can lead to diabetes type 2.Highly addictive – bread gives a feeling of euphoria, making the person craves to eat more of it. This makes it difficult to remove it from our diet, even if we want to.It is mucus-forming – this could compromise the respiratory system as the airways are being clogged or blocked.It contains gluten – while there is nothing wrong with consuming gluten-containing whole foods in moderation, many people these days are showing signs of gluten sensitivity.It makes the stomach work harder – the gluten and starches in bread need more time and strong acids to be digested. This makes the stomach work overtime and can give rise to many digestive complaints.It has low nutritional value – most nutrients are stripped when bread is being made.Contains phytates – phytates are plant anti-nutrients that interfere with the absorption of many vitamins and minerals.With these issues at hand, even healthy food items are being investigated and questioned. This includes sourdough bread. Is sourdough bread healthy? Allow the benefits of sourdough bread to answer this question. 1. It contains wild yeast and good bacteria (Lactobacillus)These two ingredients of sourdough bread predigest the starches — hence, it lightens the workload of the stomach and the digestive system as a whole.Aside from this benefit, lactobacilli stimulate the production of lactic acid. This substance stops the negative effect of phytates (found in the flour), which is interfering with the absorption of nutrients. Therefore, the person is guaranteed of taking in all the vitamins, minerals, and healthy elements in sourdough bread.At the same time, lactic acid prevents spikes of blood glucose as it slows down the release of glucose into the bloodstream. It also lowers the glycemic index of the bread; hence, the individual is less susceptible to hyperglycemia or increased blood sugar level.Lastly, the fermentation process (while making the bread) permits other beneficial bacteria to flourish in the gut. This means a healthier gut for the sourdough bread lover.2. It is overloaded with nutrients Unlike commercially prepared bread, sourdough bread has vitamins E, B1-B6, B12, niacin, thiamin, folate, riboflavin, iron, selenium, manganese, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium — not to mention proteins and fatty acids.One thing that sourdough bread does not have (that the other types of bread have) is toxic preservatives. This is because it has its own natural preservative — acetic acid — that inhibits the growth of molds.3. It is safe for the gluten-intolerant individualWhy? The fermentation process of sourdough bread permits good bacteria to break down the gluten proteins into small amounts. This makes sourdough bread tolerable for gluten-sensitive people.Researches and experiments have also revealed that this bread does not damage the intestinal lining of those sensitive to gluten, unlike other bread. There were no reports of clinical symptoms for them, too, that usually come with eating ordinary bread. HHL NOTE: For folks dealing with celiac disease or other forms of severe gluten intolerance you need to make a gluten-free sourdough starter please see the link below. Not ALL sourdough bread is gluten-free.In conclusion, to answer the question, ""Is sourdough bread healthy?"" The answer is plain and simple – ""yes."" But as I have said many times before, moderation and balance are key.Oh! And if you are looking for a way to live a healthy lifestyle while eating delicious, colorful meals and losing or maintaining weight the healthy way, click here. Sources",https://t.co/PTh4mt8gam,news

Does including ginger in the diet help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"Does including ginger in the diet help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes? Posted by Medivizor on Apr 21, 2019 in Diabetes mellitus | In a nutshell The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ginger consumption on blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The main finding of the study was that patients who consumed ginger had improved blood sugar control.Some background Ginger is a non-toxic spice that is considered safe by the FDA. Some studies have shown ginger to be beneficial in patients with (T2D). HbA1c is a blood test that measures average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. It is a marker of blood sugar control. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) is blood sugar levels when a patient has not eaten in 8 or more hours. FBS is usually high in T2D.The effect of ginger in the diet of HbA1c and FBS in patients with T2D is still under debate.Methods &amp; findings This study analyzed results from 8 different trials. These included 454 patients with T2D overall. Patients in the trials were assigned to consume either 1600– 4000mg ginger daily or not to consume any ginger.There was no significant difference in the FBS levels of patients who consumed ginger and those that did not consume ginger. However, patients who consumed ginger had a significant improvement in their HbA1c levels. Patients who did not consume any ginger had no improvement in their HbA1c.The bottom line The authors concluded that dietary ginger did not improve FBS levels but did improve HbA1c in patients with T2D. They suggested that ginger might have an impact on blood sugar control over a longer period of time.The fine print The studies included were very small. Larger studies are needed for better evidence.What's next? If you have any concerns about T2D and diet, please consult with your doctor.Original Title :Dietary ginger as a traditional therapy for blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Best supplements for diabetes: Add magnesium to diet for high blood sugar symptoms,"Diabetes is a common condition that affects millions of people in the UK, and 90 per cent of cases are caused by type 2 diabetes. The condition is caused by the body not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the body not reacting to insulin. You could lower your risk of diabetes by making some simple changes to your daily diet or lifestyle. One of the best ways to protect against high blood sugar is to regularly take magnesium supplements, it's been claimed.Taking magnesium supplements could help to protect against insulin resistance, which is linked to diabetes, revealed medical website Everyday Health.Adding just 100mg of magnesium to your diet could lower your risk of diabetes by as much as 15 per cent, it said.Similarly, you could be more at risk of a magnesium deficiency if you've been diagnosed with diabetes.That's because patients tend to lose a lot of their magnesium in their urine, as their body tries to get rid of excess sugar.""People with diabetes tend to be deficient in magnesium, which is a mineral that plays a role in nearly 300 biochemical or enzymatic reactions in the body,"" it said.""Magnesium deficiency has been linked to insulin resistance, which is central to the development of type 2 diabetes.""On the flip side, increasing your intake of magnesium has been shown to possibly lower your risk of developing the chronic disease.""The kidneys are important organs that are charged with maintaining a balance of magnesium.""But people with diabetes end up losing large amounts of magnesium in their urine.""You could be at risk of a magnesium deficiency if you often feel nauseous and week, it added.Left untreated, the deficiency could also lead to muscle contractions, tremors, and even numbness.If taking supplements isn't your thing, you could always try eating more magnesium-rich foods, including dark leafy green vegetables, sunflower seeds, and even sweet potatoes.You could also lower your risk of diabetes symptoms by making some simple diet or lifestyle swaps.While there aren't any foods that diabetics should actively avoid, it's important to limit the amount of sugar, fat and salt in your diet.Many people may have diabetes without even knowing it, because the signs don't necessarily make you feel unwell.Common diabetes symptoms include feeling very tired, passing more urine than normal, and having blurred vision.Speak to a doctor if you're worried about the symptoms of diabetes, or if you think you may be at risk.",https://t.co/HjsUhBHJBX,news

Type 2 diabetes: Drinking this type of tea may help to prevent blood sugar rises,"Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications with the heart, eyes, nerves, kidneys and feet if not controlled properly. Medication is often used to keep the condition under control, but it's also important to follow a healthy diet that is low in sugar, calories and fat. As well as cutting down on unhealthy foods, you may be able to keep type 2 diabetes under control by consuming foods which can help to improve insulin sensitivity and therefore blood sugar levels. According to Diabetes.co.uk, tea is one drink which may be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes.The diabetes expert notes research has shown tea may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the first place.This is because certain types of tea contain micronutrients called polyphenols, which may increase insulin activity.Polyphenols are packed with antioxidants which can help protect against inflammation and carcinogens - properties which can help prevent type 2 diabetes.However, Diabetes.co.uk notes one study of the popular drink found adding milk decreased the insulin-sensitising effects.The best type of tea to help improve insulin activity is therefore tea without milk, such as black tea, green tea and oolong tea.According to the diabetes expert, a 2009 study showed drinking three cups of tea per day could reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 40 per cent.""Tea is one of the nation's favourite drinks and research suggests it's also a healthy drink,"" said Diabetes.co.uk.""Tea brings a number of health benefits including improving insulin sensitivity.""""However, research notes that some the benefits are best experienced if you drink your tea without milk.""Improving insulin sensitivity is important for people with type 2 diabetes as they either don't produce enough of it or the insulin they do produce is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to control the level of sugar in the blood and transfer it to the cells to be turned into energy.If it is unable to do this, too much sugar will remain in the blood, which is how people develop type 2 diabetes.People with type 2 diabetes are also advised to eat more fruit and vegetables in order to maintain a healthy diet and keep the condition under control.Experts advise that even though fruit contains natural sugars, this is outweighed by the health benefits provided by the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients it has.It's important to cut down on foods high in calories and fat, as these can lead to weight gain, which can increase the risk of diabetes-associated complications.People who are overweight are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in the first place.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.",https://t.co/KDYxWgL9K8,news
Type 2 diabetes: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?,"Type 2 diabetes management: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?&amp;nbsp New Delhi: You may have heard that drumstick or Moringa oleifera leaves can help maintain blood sugar levels, making it an effective natural remedy to manage diabetes. The plant, often referred to as the miracle tree, has been used for centuries owing to its health benefits. Studies have shown that moringa oleifera contains beneficial antioxidants and bioactive compounds that can help treat and prevent diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, respiratory and skin problems. The moringa tree, which is native to India, is also known by other names such as horseradish tree or ben oil tree.Type 2 diabetes is a major global public health problem that can lead to serious complications if controlled poorly. The condition raises blood glucose (sugar) levels, also known as hyperglycaemia, which may cause damage to the eye, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels. Keeping blood sugar along with body weight under control through a combination of a healthy lifestyle and standard treatment is an important part of diabetes management. Studies show certain herbs and spices blood sugar-lowering properties, and one such being drumstick leaves. Take a look at how this plant can be useful in controlling diabetes.Can Moringa leaves help treat diabetes?Various studies showed effects of moringa leaves on lowering blood sugar levels in diabetes patients and animals, indicating that the plant can be used as a natural way to combat the disease. One study involving 30 women reported that consuming 7 grams of moringa leaf powder everyday for three months helped reduce fasting blood sugar levels 13.5 per cent, on average.Similarly, another small study found that using moringa leaves - about 50 grams - in a meal reduced the rise in blood sugar by some 21 per cent. However, it may be noted that more work is required before making any solid recommendations.Research showed that plant compounds such as isothiocyanates in moringa can help reduce body weight, improve glucose tolerance and insulin signaling in mice fed very high-fat diet (VHFD) supplemented with 5% moringa concentrate (MC). The results also revealed that these mice did not develop fatty liver disease compared to VHFD-fed mice.It is claimed that moringa can help reduce the amount of sugar in the blood, as well as glucose and protein in the urine, which may help treat diabetes.Benefits and risks of Moringa leavesMoringa oleifera is has been used in traditional herbal medicines for many years. The plant is believed to offer many benefits and its uses range from beauty to preventing and curing diseases - such as asthma, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, digestive issues, etc.Moringa leaves are packed with nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are good for your health. However, consuming it is not recommended for pregnant women as moringa may possess anti-fertility qualities. If you have diabetes and are considering using moringa, we suggest you discuss it with your doctor first.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Executive Vitality™: Blood Sugar and Decision Making,"Have you ever been in a meeting and become so hungry that you would agree to just about anything to have the meeting end? Being aware of the things you might say or do when you are hungry can help you avoid sacrificing your composure or making bad decisions.Great leaders ensure they maintain a high level of composure, so it is important to understand that eating habits and blood sugar levels can have an immediate and direct impact on one's decision-making, openness to risk-taking, communication, and ultimately, credibility. And the impacts can affect others' lives.Don't make decisions when you are hungry and do be aware of things you say when you are hungry, I have a towel in my kitchen emblazoned with this message: ""I am sorry for the things I said when I was hungry"" – that statement can be taken as either regret or an apology.From parole decisions and risk-taking to faulty decision-making on the part of organizational leaders, it is not a huge leap. A study of judges found that those who had eaten just before having to decide whether to grant parole or not were more likely to decide in favor of the accused's parole. Right after lunch or a snack, the odds of being granted parole soar to a high of 65% and then as the judge's hunger pangs take hold, plummet to nothing. See Justice Is Served but More So after Lunch-How Food Breaks Sway the Decisions of Judges, Ed Jong, Discover Magazine, April 11, 2011.Other studies have shown that, when people are hungry, they are more likely to make risky decisions. When they are sated, they are more risk-averse. See, National Institutes of Health, Your Decisions Are What You Eat, NIH, May 17, 2013. The potential downsides of hungry decision-making vis-à-vis risk are obvious.You owe it to yourself, your direct reports, colleagues, and ultimately, the organization and its stakeholders to pay attention to your metabolic status. That is a somewhat academic way of saying: ""Take good care of yourself. Eat when you need to. And don't make decisions if your blood sugar is low.""Ways to avoid the hunger trap:Say, ""I need to postpone this decision. I will get back to you.""Say, ""Can we postpone our meeting until after lunch?""Carry calorie-metered snacks with you. A physician I know carries 10 almonds with him and administers them to himself as needed.Don't skip meals. Make your state of mind and body a priority. This is not being selfish; it is being a good steward of your organization.Have you ever made bad decisions when you actually needed to take a meal break? What can you think of that would prevent this in the future, in addition to the suggestions above?Download This Tip",https://t.co/FnuO4MW3H6,news

The Best Exercise for Blood Sugar Control is Not What You Think,"When patients struggle with high bloodsugar, doctors often tell them to exercise more. They typically recommendwalking, jogging, biking, or some other kind of aerobic workout.New research has good news for patientswho hate running but still want to get their blood sugar under control.The study waspublished in the journal Diabetes/MetabolismResearch and Reviews. The research team recruited 172 subjects between theages of 55 and 75. All were prediabetic. That means they had high blood sugar,but not high enough to have full-blown diabetes.[1]The subjectswere randomly placed into one of four groups:A control group that did no exercise.A group that did aerobic dancing. They warmedup for five minutes, then danced for 50 minutes. They ended with five minutesof stretching.A group that did resistance training, such aschest presses, leg presses, pull downs, and shoulder presses. They did60-minute workouts.A group that did a combination of the aerobic andresistance exercises. They devoted a half-hour to each.The three exercise groups worked outthree times a week on non-consecutive days.All subjects were asked to follow thesame diet.After two years, compared to thecontrol group, the incidence of diabetes was reduced by:72% in the aerobic training group.65% in the resistance training group.74% in the combination exercise group.The differencesin these numbers are barely significant, the researchers said. They show thatresistance training works about as well as aerobic exercise to preventdiabetes.The studyauthors wrote: ""We showed that resistance training is a viable option forpatients seeking to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes,"" they said.[2]A New Option for Blood Sugar ControlIf you have diabetes or prediabetes, don't limit yourself tocardio. Weightlifting and other muscle-building resistance workouts can be justas effective.Independent Healing readers recently discovered the best way to get fast results from resistance exercise.

Blood Sugar Control and Fertility,"UPDATE Sept. 2018 – While the info I share in today's blog post (and all of my ""Let's Get Personal"" blog posts) will be helpful to those who are starting out on their healing journeys, I felt it pertinent to post a quick update as to where I am now in my healing journey. It has been quite the adventure with all sorts of ups and downs, twists and turns. I got to a point where I no longer felt drawn to share so many intimate details so I stopped writing the Let's Get Personal series in 2016. If you would like to get the most recent update on my health and healing journey, please read this post,Â 3 Reasons Why I No Longer Share About My Healing Journey Online. or watch the video below. You are always more than welcome to email me with any questions as well! Cheers! ~JessicaVIDEO~~~~~Featured Image Above CreditÂ sxc.hu and RotorheadThis is going to be a long post, but I really hope you'll bear with me and read through it. I hope that the information I share will be helpful to at least one person.I am not saying that lowering your carbohydrates is going to magically make you fertile. I'm also not saying that this is the be-all end-all for wellness. What I am saying is that getting your blood sugar under control is the first step that you can take in improving your fertility. To get your blood sugar under control, going low-carb has been proven time and time again to be effective. Nothing in your body can be healed if there are underlying metabolic (i.e. blood sugar) issues. That is a fact. Some people are going to struggle with blood sugar issues for the rest of their lives. In order to control those, they might have to remain low carb. Find what works for you and your body and stick with it. But, don't kid yourself and think that you have nothing to worry about onÂ theÂ blood sugar front. I'd venture to say that almost everyone walking around today has some sort of blood sugar imbalance.Also, I am just sharing my experiences, because I trulyÂ believeÂ that by sharing our stories with one another, we can learn and heal.OK. Read on.DISCLAIMER:Â The content shared on this site is for informational and educational purposes only.

My husband and I would like to start a family in a couple years and I honestly have fears that I won't be able to conceive. Now that I have received all of my blood work, we know where we stand and can start making a road map for healing. I'll discuss more of my diagnosis in a different post.First and foremost. If you don't know how your blood sugar works, then please read this post: ""How Does Your Blood Sugar Work?"" Please note that: ""Blood sugar balance (or blood glucose level) is one of the 2 most tightly regulated systems in the body, with the other being blood pH."" Â So yeah. It's kind of important. I don't want to go into the basics of blood sugar in this post, in an effort to save time, so read the one above to get theÂ overviewÂ of how it works andÂ whatÂ normal numbers are.The more blog posts and comments and Facebook posts that I read from people around the Web, the more and more clear it becomes that people simply do not understand how the blood sugar system works and why it is CRITICAL that it is managed well.Blood sugar has to be managed before ANYTHING else can be addressed. I cannot stress the importance of this enough, and I think many other people, people who are much more educated and popular than me, would agree.You cannot sit there and tell me that you're eating all these carbs and that it is having no effect on your blood sugar and insulin. If you continuously dump excess carbs (even ""good"" carbs like soaked and sprouted grains, legumes, breads, etc.) into your system, sooner or later, you will have blood sugar issues. Note, I said excess. Some carbohydrate intake is necessary. Grains, pasta, potato chips, ice cream, bread, cakes, cookies, etc., at every meal, or even a few times a week, are not necessary.But, I digress.The first thing that one must do to improve their fertility is get their blood sugar under control.Now, before you say (and boy, have I heard this 1,000 times in the last couple weeks), ""I get my blood sugar checked every year and it's normal"", let me just tell you that even if that lab comes back normal, there is still a chance thatÂ thereÂ are still underlying issues that you're not aware of. That is simply because doctors don't do anything but the bare basics when it comes to checking blood sugar metabolism. As long as the standard lab comes back ""normal"", that's good enough from them.Â BelieveÂ me, because it happened to me.The standard lab that most of us have received is the Fasting Blood Glucose test (FBG). According to Chris Kresser, ""It only tells us how blood sugar behaves in a fasting state. It tells us very little about how your blood sugar responds to the food you eat.""Before we proceed, let me just say that I am speaking from personal experience here. In all the years that IÂ haveÂ been getting my yearly physicals (about 14 years total), I have never had my standard blood sugar test come back abnormal (the FBG is the only one I've ever had). Scratch that, it came back abnormal one time, when I was in college and eating loads of crap. I stopped eating crap, had it re-tested in 3 months and I was normal again. That was a good lesson for meÂ thatÂ if you eat crap, you get crappy results.Fast forward 14 years of normal blood sugar tests to today. Last week, I got my blood sugar tests back. And they were not what we expected.First, I had theÂ C-PeptideÂ test, which is used to monitor insulin production and to help determine the cause of low blood sugar. That came back in the normal range.Second, I had the FBG, I also had myÂ Hemoglobin A1cÂ test done, which came back in theÂ normalÂ range, but it was on the higher end of the range.Lastly, I had to have a 2-hour monitored blood glucose test done. This is called the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).Â For this test (if you've never had one of them) they prick your finger and take your fasting blood sugar. Then, they give you this DISGUSTING, fake orange flavored, glucose-laden, nasty drink and have you chug it (ewwwwwwwwwwwww!). Then, they test your blood sugar at hour 1 and then hour 2. You get three blood sugar readings in all.According to the OGTT, I am diabetic.Now, before you ask why I'm not freaking out, let me tell you why I'm not.1. My doctor didn't freak out about it.2. My other numbers are ""normal"".3. I have been, and will continue eating, low-carb, because I know it works, and my doctor knows it works, and has hadÂ countlessÂ success stories with this form of eating.4. I don't really think that the OGTT is the best test in the world. According to Chris Kresser, ""The other problem with the OGTT is that it's completely artificial. I don't know anyone who drinks a pure solution of 75 grams of glucose. A 32-oz Big Gulp from 7-11 has 96 grams of sugar, but 55% of that is fructose, which produces a different effect on blood sugar. The OGTT can be a brutal test for someone with impaired glucose tolerance, producing intense blood sugar swings far greater than what one would experience from eating carbohydrates.""When we got the labs back, I was so pleased with my doctor's reactions. He never once mentioned medication. He never once gave me a diagnosis of being diabetic. He just said, ""Interesting"" and then proceeded to discuss diet and nutrition with me (which included him advocating that I eat lots of coconut oil. NICE!).This is totally fixable. And, for the record, I don't think that I am diabetic. I think that there isÂ definitelyÂ something out of whack in my body and it could be a combination of various things, including my thyroid and adrenal health (which I will discuss in a different post). I know that with a continued low-carb diet, exercise, and some weight loss, things will correct themselves.Now, I want to state something right here and now.Prior to this test, I was not gorging on lots of heavy-carb filled meals, lots of sweets, and tons of sugar and soda. I was eating a real food diet (think Nourishing Traditions), with lots of protein, fats, fruits, and some grains. I was by no means eating a your Standard American Diet (SAD).&lt;begin pity party&gt;To be brutally honest, when I saw these numbers I was shocked,Â becauseÂ it seemed unfair. Here I was, doing what I thought was best, and it wasn't enough. It's unfair that I try to live a healthy life, and this isÂ whatÂ I get. Look at all the people walking around eating Big Macs and chugging down Big Gulps, and here I am eating, grass-fed dairy, grass-fed meats, properly prepared grains, etc., and I am the one with problems? Dammit.&lt;end pity party&gt;That said, I am really glad I got all of these additional labs done,Â becauseÂ now I know where I stand. I didn't feel any different than I usually do. I had no idea that something was amiss with my blood sugar. I didn't have any diabetic symptoms. It hadn't even crossed my mind that I was having blood sugar issues. So, I was actually quite shocked at my results.The last time I had blood work, which wasn't that long ago, the doctor said everything was ""normal"". But, then again, that doctor only ranÂ whatÂ was considered standard (the FBG test). They didn't thinkÂ aboutÂ doing all ofÂ theÂ additional testing that my new doctor has done. It makes me wonder if there were underlying issues for quite some time, but because I was always ""normal"" no one thought anything different.Hmmm … food for thought there if you've always had normal labs … Just because you don't think you have blood sugar issues does not mean that you really are in the clear. I had no clue about mine.If you want more great reading about blood sugar, I strongly encourage you to check out these two posts from Chris Kresser:When your ""normal blood sugar isn't normal (Part 1)When your ""normal blood sugar isn't normal (Part 2)OK, Let's Talk About BabiesImbalanced blood sugar, insulinÂ resistance, and diabetes WILL have negative effects on your fertility. A simple Google search will yield millions of results that will back that statement up.So, put down the potato chips, set down the bowl of properly prepared rice, and lay down the sandwich made on sprouted wheat bread, and let's get down to business.In just a sampling of the literature I have read on this subject of blood sugar imbalance and infertility, Dr. John Briffa says that carbohydrates are linked to infertility in women:Sometimes, problems with ovulation can relate to a condition known as polycystic ovarian syndrome or 'PCOS'. Individuals with this condition often have problems with sugar and insulin regulation in the body. A mainstay of medical treatment for PCOS are drugs designed primarily for diabetes. Treating women with PCOS with these drugs has been found to improve ovulatory function.Other evidence has linked higher levels of HbA1c (a measure of blood sugar control over the last 2-3 months) and reduced fertility.These lines of evidence suggest that, generally speaking, high levels of blood sugar-disruptive carbohydrates in the diet might be bad news for female fertility.Dr. Briffa goes on to say,…The results of this study found that compared to women eating diets of lower GL values, those eating diets with the highest GL were 92 per cent more likely to suffer from ovulatory infertility. Total carbohydrate intake was also associated with risk of ovulatory fertility, with highest intakes associated with a 91 per cent increased risk compared to the lowest intakes.As a disclaimer, I don't know if IÂ haveÂ PCOS. That is an area that I have not looked into, but at the rate things are going, I wouldn't be surprised.So, simply put (because it is a little more complex than this), eating excess carbohydrates –&gt; leads to blood sugar imbalances –&gt; leads to issues with fertility.Note that I say excess. Again, some carbs are needed in our diet, however, that intake is way less than you would think. We do not need to eat bread with breakfast, grains with lunch, and pasta with dinner, in order to be healthy. It's time that we start changing our perceptions of what is considered healthy. Just because your grains have been soaked and sprouted, your cakes are made with coconut flour and honey, and your ice cream is homemade, doesn't mean those things are healthy! And, please, spare me the ""everything in moderation"" excuse. Do you eat arsinic in moderation? How about smoking? Is that OK in moderation?On August 1st, I started Lydia's (from Divine Health) Blood Sugar Control Challenge. IÂ haveÂ also transitioned my style of eating from a traditional foods (aka. Nourishing Traditions) style, to a more Paleo/Primal style. IÂ haveÂ received countless comments about how that will do more harm than good, butÂ frankly, I don't buy it. IÂ haveÂ been moderate/high carb up until this point, but I am going to become more strictly low-carb, at least for awhile. Perhaps once my blood sugar issues are stabilized, I can start adding more carbs in. But, I know that I will never go back to grains, because frankly, I feel SO much better without them in my diet. And, even when I do start adding more carbs in, I can't see going over 100 grams per day. Now that I am accustomed to this style of eating, I don't crave carbs. I don't want sweets. I don't even miss my favorite sourdough bread. I feel full and satiated and pleased with the foods I am eating.Coincidentally, I just found this article from Liz at Paleo Pregnancy Guide:A Paleo diet isn't necessarily a low-carb diet, but sometimes reducing your carbohydrate intake can be beneficial. This has proven to be the case when it comes to improving fertility. Specialist Dr. Michael D. Fox from the Jacksonville Center for Reproductive Medicine says thatÂ nutrition plays an important role in fertility, and ovulation disorders are often the result of elevated insulin levels caused by excess carbohydrate in the diet.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is frequently found in those who have trouble conceiving. It is now the number-one cause of infertility. This hormonal disturbance is closely related to metabolic syndrome and is often found in women who struggle with their weight.According to Dr. Fox, women at his clinic who follow a low-carb diet double their chances of conception. Those who stick to a diet as close to zero carbs as possible rarely need aggressive therapies and become pregnant in one or two cycles with simple oral fertility drugs.Let's Talk CarbsSo, how many carbs should you be eating? According to this article from Mark's Daily Apple, the amount of carbs that we need to survive is much less than you would think.0-50 carbs per day for a ketosis state and accelerated fat burning (it's wise to be under the care of a physician if you're going to drop this low). I am personally in the 40-50 carbs per day range, per the request of my doctor.50-100 grams per day is the ""primal sweet spot for effortless weight loss"", because it minimizes insulin production.100-150 grams per day is theÂ optimalÂ maintenance range.150-300 per day is going to equate steady weight gain.300+ carbs per day puts you in the danger zone!For all you people who may have skipped reading the ""How Does Your Blood Sugar Work"" post above, you might not be getting the full effects of what I am writing. Try reading this one instead: ""The Definitive Guide to Insulin, Blood Sugar &amp; Type 2 Diabetes (and you'll understand it)"".For optimal health, the 100-150 range is a good range, provided you have no blood sugar issues and that fact has been established through proper testing. If you are able to consume that many carbs, it is a lot easier to reach that 100-150 mark than you would think. Just take a look at these numbers — and these are just basic foods, not even full meals. Also, it doesn't matter if these are homemade or store bought. Carbs are carbs are carbs. Our bodies treat them the same way.1 cup brown rice = 45 grams carbs1 cup white rice = 37 carbs1 slice wheat bread = 15 carbs1 slice sourdough breadÂ = 19 carbs1 whole wheat pancake (6″) = 38 carbs1/2 cup dry rolled oats = 32 carbs2oz (approx. 3/4 cup cooked) whole grain spaghetti = 42 carbs1 small Russet potato = 30 grams carbs1 cup hashbrowns = 55 carbs1 cup sweet potato = 41 carbs1 cup quinoa = 39 carbs1 cup black beans = 41 carbs1 cup pinto beans = 45 carbs1 cup whole milk = 13 carbsI could go on and on, but you get the picture. If you want to stay in that healthy range of 100-150, it doesn't take much to get you to that number. Even in a recent interview of Mark Sisson, he said that he hovers around the 100 mark and feels fantastic. His numbers would actually be lower, if he didn't have the occasional piece of chocolate or glass of red wine. And, have you seen Mark Sisson lately? (Ladies, you might like to click on that link. Men, you might like to as well.) Ummm … yeah …. I hope I look that good when I'm in my 50's (you know, the girl version).But, again, I digress. I'm sure the women reading this post don't mind though. ğŸ˜‰So, the fact is: If your blood sugar is messed up, your fertility is messed up. Simple as that.Â So, if you are at all serious about (a) conceiving, (b) living a long, healthy life, (c) losing weight and feeling better, (d) avoiding disease later in life, or (e) any or all of the above, this is what I recommend:1. Get serious about this. Realize that blood sugar regulation is delicate and can easily be messed up. This is serious. I cannot stress that enough. Even if you've never had your FBG come back abnormal, there could still be underlying issues.2. Get your doctor to do some additional blood sugar testing and see what your results are. Get your normal FBG lab, but also request the C-Peptide, theÂ Hemoglobin A1c, and, if you are really curious, the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, but let me warn you, it is nasty, nasty stuff.3. Get a blood sugar monitor and start testing at home. This is going to be the easiest and most efficient way to see what is really going on with your blood sugar levels.4. Reduce your stress. Stress interferes with proper blood glucose levels. Stress also makes you fat and diabetic.5. Exercise. Exercise plays an important role in blood sugar control. Plus, you get all the awesome other benefits from it like, a healthier heart, less jiggle in the belly, and a nicer butt.6. Lose that extra weight. Understand that extra weight has detrimental effects on your blood sugar. Now, I don'tÂ believeÂ that we all fall into the ""ideal"" weight ranges that the medical community sets forth, however, even 20 or 30 extra pounds can have a major effect on your overall health, including your blood sugar. I don't think the ""experts"" would disagree with me on this either. There is no good reason for women to carry around an extra 20, 30, 40 pounds. Women should be curvy, but curves don't weigh that much.7. Get lots and lots of sleep. Get less than 6 hours on most nights and you're 3 times more likely to have elevated blood sugar levels.8. Say goodbye to excess carbs. This doesn't mean that you can never have a cup of kefired ice cream or a homemade brownie ever again (two of my favorite indulgences – I can't help but stare at the photos and shed a small tear). But, you can't have them until you get your blood sugar issues resolved. And, even then, they should be reserved for very special occasions and do not need to be eaten daily, or even weekly. Think birthdays and anniversaries.I could go on and on and on. This is such a huge topic with so much information. I have barely scratched the surface, but my recent fascination with this subject has been brought on byÂ conversationsÂ with my doctor, medical industry experts, my nutritional therapist, and many friends who are also facing similar challenges right now. The information I share above is true. It's just up to you to choose what youÂ believe.Oh, and P.S. There is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more that goes into your fertility and thyroid health thanÂ justÂ checking your temperature. That is NOT a goodÂ gaugeÂ of whether or not you are fertile and healthy. Get your blood sugar sorted out and then let's talk about temperature.Talk to me. I want to hear your feedback! Let's start the discussion below!Health Journey Update – 8/18/15Here are a few videos of my current progress. To see even more up-to-date info onÂ my personal health journey, check out my YouTube channel here.VIDEOVIDEOVIDEOVIDEOSupport Your Stress Response, Adrenals, Thyroid, and Whole Body Through HerbsWhen it comes to supporting overall wellness, herbs are a great tool to have in your toolkit, especially those who may be dealing with chronic illness of some type. Since 2009, when I started this site, I have met thousands upon thousands of people through my work and by far, the #1 health complaints are:Because of this, I wanted to add in a section into this post about the benefit of using herbs with chronic illness. Adaptogens are by far one of the most used herbs when it comes to working with people who have low energy, fatigue, and overall imbalance in the endocrine system (thyroid, adrenals, and blood sugar).While the benefits of adaptogenic herbs extend far beyond just supporting that one system, this tends to be one of the main reasons people turn to adaptogenic herbs in the first place.Â That said there are a lot of other herbs out there that offer amazing support for the body, especially those dealing with chronic illness which is why I wanted to share this section today.If you are dealing with any type of chronic illness, I'm sorry to break it to you, but caffeine may not be your best friend. ğŸ™� While you canÂ find lots of info online in both the pro- and the anti-coffee camps, the fact of the matter comes down to the fact that are a lot of people dealing with chronic illness, especially thyroid and adrenal problems, that simply cannot tolerate coffee and caffeine.While those with sluggish adrenal glands tend to feel run down and in need of a regular pick-me-up (like coffee and other caffeinated beverages), in the long run, caffeine can do more harm than good while you are healing. I go into the ""whys"" around caffeine and your adrenals in this detailed post here. In addition to the caffeine, there are other constituents, molds, and mycotoxins that can show up in coffee that some people find they react to and can further exacerbate the toxic load on the body.When I was diagnosed with autoimmune disease and adrenal fatigue, one of the first things that had to go was coffee.Â In addition to dealing with these issues, we suspected that I was having some detox pathway sluggishness so we wanted to also focus on supporting the liver and lymph systems. Most people who are dealing with chronic illness are also going to have issues with detoxification of the body, which is why herbs can play such an important role.Â To be honest, I never drank coffee because of the caffeine. I drank coffee for the taste and aroma, as well as the emotional experience I felt to my morning cup of joe. For me, it was a ritual that I looked forward to every day (and sometimes multiple times a day). Whether I was brewing it at home or going to my local coffee shops, the experience was one that I clung to tightly.But, when I was faced with new health struggles, I knew I had to do whatever I could to support my body and give it the tools it needed to heal. Giving up coffee and caffeine was one step in this direction.And it sucked.I turned to the coffee substitutes on the market in a desperate attempt to recreate the ritual I had grown so fond of, but nothing ever tasted the way I wanted it to. Nothing ever gave me that same experience that my cup of ""real"" coffee did. I knew there had to be something better, but I simply could not find it on my health food store's shelves.Necessity is the mother of invention so that is why I created my own coffee substitutes. They were made with organic, sustainably harvested herbs with zero grains, zero gluten, and zero caffeine. Just herbs.Herbs that not only tasted delicious but supported my body's function, like liver detox, bile production, digestion, etc.Â All of the herbs used in my ""coffee"" blends have been used for thousands of years to support the body's normal functions and help everything work a little better — something we all need in today's toxic world! (psst, dandelion is one of the herbs!)When it came to creating these blends, if I could get something to not only tasted amazing (and helped me recreate my dearly loved ritual), but also did amazingly supportive things for my body, then it's a no brainer!I sold these pre-made blends on Etsy for awhile and the demand was more than I could keep up with.

Type 2 diabetes: Eat pumpernickel bread to lower your blood sugar,"Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that can trigger symptoms such as needing to pee more than usual, feeling thirsty all the time and feeling very tired. But because these symptoms don't necessarily make you feel unwell, the condition can be difficult to identify. If you experience these symptoms or unexplained weight loss, itching around the penis or vagina and blurred vision you should see your GP. Type 2 diabetes complications that occur if the condition is left untreated include problems with the nerves, kidneys, eyes, feet, and heart attack and stroke. When it comes to managing your blood sugar level, whether you have the condition or not, it's important to eat a healthy diet.There's nothing you can't eat if you have type 2 diabetes says the NHS, but you'll have to limit certain foods.You should eat a wide range of food including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta.Sugar, fat and salt should be kept to a minimum and your should also make sure not to skip meals and eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day.When it comes to one of the staples of many people's diet, bread, which is best for blood sugar levels?Many breads are high in carbohydrates which can quickly raise blood sugar levels.As a result of this, eating large quantities of many breads should be avoided.But, pumpernickel bread and 100 per cent stone-ground whole wheat breads have low GI scores.GI stands for glycemic index and is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.Pumpernickel and stone-ground whole wheat breads have lower GI scores than regular whole wheat bread because the ingredients go through less processing.During processing the fibrous outer shells of grains and cereals is removed.Fibre slows digestion and helps to stabilise blood sugar levels.A 2014 study found spelt and rye bread used low initial glycemic responses in rats. Diabetes UK also advises: ""Choosing wholegrain options makes sense. They are high in fire, keep you feeling fuller for longer than refined carbohydrates and take longer for the body to break down so blood glucose levels do not 'spike' then drop rapidly.""But if pumpernickel bread doesn't whet your appetite, wholegrain, granary, spelt and rye bread are also recommended.Other carbohydrates you should opt for include wholewheat or brown pasta and noodles, basmati or wild rice, porridge oats or muesli, and quinoa, burger wheat, couscous or yam.Alongside eating a healthy diet, expert recommend being active. Here are six of the best exercise for type 2 diabetes.",https://t.co/kQfjTv0BTQ,news
Is juicing actually good for you?,"Freshly juiced fruit has become a staple in many diets – especially those of busy, health-conscious consumers who can save time on making (and perhaps even chewing) their food without missing out on nutrients. Fruit juice also has been linked to claims that it can help you both lose weight, and 'detox' your system.All of which, of course, has made it highly lucrative. The global fruit and vegetable juices market was valued at $154 billion (£123bn) in 2016 and is expected to grow.But is juicing really as healthy as we think?You might also like:• Is breakfast the most important meal of the day?• Are you eating enough salt?• Cold remedies: Old wives' tales… or legitimate science? Most foods containing fructose – a naturally occurring sugar found in all fruits and fruit juices – don't seem to have harmful effects as long as they're not contributing to excess daily calories. This is because the fibre found in whole fruits is intact, and the sugar is contained within the fruit's cells. It takes our digestive system a while to break these cells down and for fructose to enter the bloodstream.But this is not the case with fruit juice.Fibre mechanics""Fruit juice has most of the fibre removed,"" says Emma Elvin, senior clinical advisor at the charity Diabetes UK. This is why, unlike whole fruit, the fructose in fruit juices counts as 'free sugars' – which also include honey and the sugars added to foods. It's recommended by the World Health Organisation that adults have no more than 30g of added sugar, the equivalent of 150ml of fruit juice, per day. (Read more in our recent story about whether sugar really is bad for you). The problem is that, with the fibre removed, fruit juice's fructose is absorbed more quickly. Sudden spikes in blood sugar cause the pancreas to release insulin to bring it back down to a stable level. Over time, this mechanism can wear out, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In 2013, researchers analysed the health data of 100,000 people collected between 1986 and 2009 and found that fruit juice consumption was linked with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. They concluded that – since liquids pass through the stomach to the intestine faster than solids – even when the nutritional content is similar to whole fruit, fruit juice leads to faster and larger changes in glucose and insulin levels.Another study found a relationship between fruit juice and type 2 diabetes after following the diets and diabetes status of more than 70,000 nurses over 18 years. The researchers explain that the possible reason for this may partly have been the lack of the other components found in whole fruit, like fibre.Juices containing vegetables can provide more nutrients and less sugar than juices made up of just fruit – but they still lack valuable fibre. Diets high in fibre have been linked to a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and diabetes, and it's recommended adults consume 30g per day.Overall excessAside from the link to type 2 diabetes, many studies agree that fruit juice is harmful if it contributes to an excess in calories.In an analysis of 155 studies, John Sievenpiper, associate professor at the University of Toronto's Department of Nutritional Sciences, set out to understand if the associations between sugary soft drinks and health – including risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease – were applicable to the food and drink we generally consume as part of a healthy diet. He compared studies looking into the effects of fructose-containing sugars (including sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, honey and syrups) with control diets free from or lower in these sugars. His aim? To isolate the effects of consuming too many calories from the effects of foods containing different sugars.He found negative effects to fasting blood sugar and insulin levels when food provided excess calories from sugars, including fruit juice. However, when the calories weren't in excess overall, there were some advantages to consuming whole fruit – and even fruit juice. Sievenpiper concludes that the recommended 150ml of fruit juice per day, which is an average serving, is reasonable.The paper concluded that foods containing fructose may have some small benefits for long-term blood sugar control when they don't lead to over-consumption of calories. But when they do lead to too many calories, they risk raising blood sugar and insulin levels. This could be because fructose has a relatively low GI, the paper states, while high GI diets are associated with insulin resistance.""Getting a whole fruit is better than fruit juice, but if you're going to use juice as a complement to fruits and vegetables, that's fine – however, not if you're using juice for hydration and drinking large amounts,"" Sievenpiper says.So while we know that fruit juice can cause diabetes if it's part of a diet that's more calorific overall, it's less clear how juice affects the long-term health of those who aren't overweight.""There's still a lot we don't understand about how having increased sugar in the diet without weight gain changes risk,"" says Heather Ferris, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Virginia. ""For how long and well the pancreas can keep up with the sugar is partly down to genetics.""But we have a higher risk of consuming more than the recommended daily number of calories (around 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men) on the days we drink juice, according to research. Numerous studies have shown that drinking fruit juice doesn't make us consume any less of other foods throughout the day.""It's also easy to consume large amounts of fruit juice quite quickly, meaning extra calories. And when calories increase, this can contribute to weight gain,"" Elvin says.With a twistBut one study published last year may have found a way to make juicing healthier. Researchers used a 'nutrient extractor' blender that, unlike traditional juicers, juices the whole fruit, including seeds and skin. They measured the effects of mixed fruit and peeled mango – both of which rank highly on the glycaemic index and therefore cause a spike in blood sugar – juiced in a nutrient extractor blender, compared with another group who ate the same fruit whole.Those who drank nutrient-extracted mixed fruit had a lower blood sugar increase compared with the whole mixed fruit group, while there were no differences between those who had mango juice and whole mango.However, this was a small study, and the researchers didn't compare their findings with juice made by any other method, such as squeezing out the juice and leaving the skin and seeds.Gail Rees, senior lecturer in human nutrition at the University of Plymouth and researcher on the study, says the findings were probably caused by the fruit seeds contained in the juices. But she says it's difficult to offer clear advice from this study.""I'd certainly go along with the current advice of 150ml of fruit juice per day, but if you do use a nutrient extractor at home, it could be keeping blood sugar levels relatively stable,"" she says.But while keeping seeds in the juice may make some difference during digestion, Ferris argues this doesn't necessarily change how filling the juice is.""When the juice includes some fibre it will slow down absorption, but you still have excess calorie intake because it's easy to consume. However, it's an improvement over traditional fruit juice,"" she says.Other ways we can improve the effects of fruit juice on our health include making sure we select ripe fruit to retain as much of its goodness as possible, according to Roger Clemens, professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Southern California.It's also important to recognise that different juicing methods are better suited to different fruit because of their physical make-up, Clemens has found. For example, most of the phytonutrients in grapes are found in the seed, with very little found in the pulp. And most of the beneficial phenolic and flavonoid compounds found in oranges are located in the peel, which is lost with traditional juicing.Detox debunkedAnother reason for fruit juice's recent popularity is the argument that it can help to detox the body.However, the only medically recognised use of the word 'detox' refers to removing harmful substances from the body, including drugs, alcohol and poison.""The whole concept of a juice diet being detoxifying is a fallacy,"" says Clemens. ""We consume compounds every day that may be toxic and our bodies do a wonderful job of detoxing and eliminating everything we eat.""And juice isn't a cure-all for getting your nutrients, either. ""There are a lot of nutrients contained in the parts of the fruits, such as in apple skins, that are excluded when you juice them,"" says Ferris. ""You end up with sugary water with some vitamins.""Plus, she adds, it's not an ideal way to reach the advised 'five a day'. ""People try to get five servings of fruit and vegetables per day and don't realise this isn't just about getting vitamins,"" she says. ""It's also about reducing the amount of grain carbs and protein and fats in our diet, and increasing fibre."" So while fruit juice is better than no fruit at all, there are limits. It particularly comes with risks when we consume more than 150ml of free sugars per day, or when it puts us over our recommended calorie intake. It provides us with vitamins – but fruit juice is far from a quick fix.Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

This Mother's Story Shows How Doug Ford's Cuts Will Put Lives at Risk,"Last year Doug Ford announced major changes to OHIP+, the program that covered prescription drugs for children and youth under 25.Ford cancelled the program, shifting the burden to parents and forcing many to pay hundreds of extra dollars per month.As one mother's story shows, those cuts could have real impacts on people's lives.Sarah Elizabeth's daughter suffers from type 1 diabetes. One night her child experienced a dramatic drop in glucose levels, one that could've killed her. .Sarah was only notified because of a wearable device that monitors her daughter's blood glucose levels. Without that notification, her child could have died from Dead in Bed Syndrome, a term used to describe sudden deaths of young children with type 1 diabetes.But Sara is at risk of losing her monitor due to Ford's recent cuts to OHIP. Her benefits will no longer cover the device and she could be forced to pay hundreds of extra dollars she can't afford.It's part of a larger set of cuts to OHIP coverage initiated under the Ford government.Here's the full story along with Sarah's Facebook post: Just about to settle into bed for night and I hear Briers dexcom alarm sounding an urgent low. 3.2 and quickly dropping.I had just tested half hour prior (10.2 great night time number) and I would not have tested again til our regular night check at 3 am. She may not have survived til 3 am.She had an unexpected and unexplained sudden drop. (This happens… could be growth, stress, sickness ) Without the dex, we legitimately could have lost her. No lie or exaggeration. Please Google night time lows for me, and T1D. It's scary. They call it ""Dead in Bed Syndrome."" Simply horrifying.But now due to #dougford 's changes to OHIP+ our benefits will max out at $2000/yr we will not be able to afford the Dex. (It is $360/month for sensors and $380 every three months for transmitter)Her monthly costs for insulin, test strips, pokey refills will average up to $400+ month. And no, the pharmacist told us when we max out, it's ALL out of pocket, despite what we heard on news.Thank you to #dougford for making it nearly unmanageable for me to keep my child alive… and all you that voted him in at the cost of our healthcare, education and environment. Shame on you. #fuckdougford#stopdougfordSarah took to social media to thank everyone for the concern and for sharing her story.TThis is just another example of how Ford's cuts are putting people's lives at risk.",https://t.co/ucUpOSP4is,news
Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

Green Peas (Matar) For Diabetes: Why This Desi Veggie Is Good For Regulating Blood Sugar,"HighlightsDiabetics must be very careful about their dietDiabetics may benefit from adding green peas to their daily dietGreen peas are rich in protein and fibre, and low in caloriesType-2 diabetes is a condition which affects the way the body processes blood sugar. In this condition, the body of the patient either doesn't produce the hormone insulin or it resists the effects of insulin, making it incapable of regulating blood sugar. There are over 10 million cases of Type-2 diabetes in India every year. Some of the reported symptoms of Type-2 diabetes include excessive thirst, frequent urge to urinate, hunger, fatigue and blurred vision. This condition may be managed through medication, exercise and by following a healthy diet. It is crucial for a patient of Type-2 diabetes to follow a strict and healthy diet, which prevents any sudden spikes in blood sugar levels. This is why diabetics must carefully analyse every food on their plate and include more foods that control blood sugar.Green pea or matar is one such vegetable that diabetics may benefit from including in their diet. One of the most popular desi vegetables, green peas are utilised in Indian cooking across the subcontinent. Although peas are a winter vegetable, nowadays they are available around the year. Green peas can be added to a variety of dishes to add nutrition to them.Also Read: 11 Best Matar (Peas) Recipes | Matar RecipesGreen Peas: Include matar in your diabetes dietBenefits Of Green Peas For DiabeticsThere are a number of reasons why green peas are good for patients of Type-2 diabetes:1. Low in CaloriesA 100 gm portion of green peas contains only 80 calories (as per the data by United States Department Of Agriculture). Low-calorie foods are important for diabetics as being overweight is a risk factor for Type-2 diabetes. Additionally, weight gain in diabetics makes it even harder for patients to control blood sugar levels.Also Read: Pea Milk: A New Non-Dairy Alternative That Tastes Nothing Like Pea2. Rich In PotassiumA deficiency of potassium may increase risk of diabetes and hence this mineral is important for those who are vulnerable to the condition. Green peas contain 244 mg of potassium per 100 gm (as per USDA), which may be good for diabetics. Additionally, potassium is important for keeping blood pressure levels under check.Also Read: 5 Vegetables You Must Include In Your Diabetes DietGreen peas for diabetes: Green peas contain 244 mg of potassium per 100 gm3. Rich In ProteinA 100 gm portion of green peas contains 5 gm of protein (as per USDA data). Protein is a satiating nutrient, which may prevent hunger pangs. Additionally, protein is important for weight management, which is also important for diabetics.Also Read: How To Control Diabetes Naturally: 5 Remedies To Manage Your Sugar Levels4. Rich In FibreA 100 gm portion of green peas contains 14 gm of carbohydrates, including 5 gm of fibre (as per USDA data). Fibre is perhaps the most important nutrient for diabetics to focus on. This nutrient is crucial for regulating blood sugar levels and blood pressure. This is because it is digested slowly in the body, releasing blood sugar slowly and preventing any spikes.Diabetics may add peas to their rice dishes, salads, breakfast omelettes, upma, pies and even pastas. It is important to consult your dietitian before adding any food to your diabetes diet.Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

Adopting a healthy lifestyle helps reduce the risk of dementia,"14 May 2019 – People can reduce their risk of dementia by getting regular exercise, not smoking, avoiding harmful use of alcohol, controlling their weight, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels, according to new guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) today.""In the next 30 years, the number of people with dementia is expected to triple,"" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""We need to do everything we can to reduce our risk of dementia. The scientific evidence gathered for these Guidelines confirm what we have suspected for some time, that what is good for our heart, is also good for our brain.""The Guidelines provide the knowledge base for health-care providers to advise patients on what they can do to help prevent cognitive decline and dementia. They will also be useful for governments, policy-makers and planning authorities to guide them in developing policy and designing programmes that encourage healthy lifestyles.The reduction of risk factors for dementia is one of several areas of action included in WHO's Global action plan for the public health response to dementia. Other areas include: strengthening information systems for dementia; diagnosis, treatment and care; supporting carers of people with dementia; and research and innovation.WHO's Global Dementia Observatory, launched in December 2017, is a compilation of information about country activities and resources for dementia, such as national plans, dementia-friendly initiatives, awareness campaigns and facilities for care. Data from 21 countries, including Bangladesh, Chile, France, Japan, Jordan and Togo, have already been included, with a total of 80 countries now engaged in providing data.Creating national policies and plans for dementia are among WHO's key recommendations for countries in their efforts to manage this growing health challenge. During 2018, WHO provided support to countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Qatar, Slovenia and Sri Lanka to help them develop a comprehensive, multi-sectoral public health response to dementia.An essential element of every national dementia plan is support for carers of people with dementia, said Dr Dévora Kestel, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO. ""Dementia carers are very often family members who need to make considerable adjustments to their family and professional lives to care for their loved ones. This is why WHO created iSupport. iSupport is an online training programme providing carers of people with dementia with advice on overall management of care, dealing with behaviour changes and how to look after their own health.""iSupport is currently being used in eight countries, with more expected to follow.Dementia: a rapidly growing public health problemDementia is an illness characterized by a deterioration in cognitive function beyond what might be expected from normal ageing. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language and judgement. Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain, such as Alzheimer disease or stroke.Dementia is a rapidly growing public health problem affecting around 50 million people globally. There are nearly 10 million new cases every year. Dementia is a major cause of disability and dependency among older people. Additionally, the disease inflicts a heavy economic burden on societies as a whole, with the costs of caring for people with dementia estimated to rise to US$ 2 trillion annually by 2030.",https://t.co/ACyTpBArq0,news
126: Lihi Segal-Get Healthy And Avoid Disease With Personalized Nutrition,"Lihi Segal explains how microbiomes are the key to health!I first heard about heard Lihi Segal in a TED Talk about how our diets are unique to our bodies. It was so interesting. It's not about how much we eat, it's the precise mix of foods we consume. I reached out to Lihi and DayTwo, her research company that's developing this new approach, to see if they would share with us their research findings and what it might mean for each of us. The implications of this new understanding of nutrition are enormous. What if we all could be healthier and avoid disease if we better understood what's good and bad for our individual bodies? This is big. Listen in, learn and share this conversation! It could change your life.Perhaps it is time to think about not A DIET but YOUR DIETLihi Segal is CEO and co-founder of DayTwo, a leader in the development of microbiome-based precision medicine, focusing on metabolic disease. For those of us who don't know, your gut microbiome is the collection of all the microbes (around 100 trillion) that exist in your digestive tract and help you digest food. Your microbiome is unique to you, and influences the way your body reacts to different foods.A new frontier in medicineA study conducted in 2015 at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and published in Cell was the catalyst that got Lihi into the field of personalized, microbiome-based diet solutions. The study, which for one week continuously monitored blood sugar levels in over a thousand people, revealed that the bodily response to foods was highly individual. Called the Personalized Nutrition Project, the study was led by Professors Eran Segal of the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Department and Eran Elinav of the Immunology Department. They decided to look at why diets fail and why one person can eat, say, bread and another person can't.Segal and Elinav decided that perhaps the whole approach is wrong and instead of looking at the food, we need to look at the person. This led them to develop an algorithm that collects a person's health data and then predicts which foods and meals would be good for them and which would be bad, with ""good"" being a meal that doesn't spike blood sugar levels after eating it. Prof. Segal said: ""We chose to focus on blood sugar because elevated levels are a major risk factor for diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. The huge differences in the rise of blood sugar levels among different people who consumed identical meals highlights why personalized eating choices are more likely than universal dietary advice to help people stay healthy.""It's all about your gut microbiomeWhat caught Lihi's attention was the ability of Segal and Elinav's technology to customize low blood sugar level diets for each individual, something very new in the nutrition realm, so her company licensed it. If she could help people avoid disease, and death, Lihi was in. Researchers at DayTwo then built a mathematical predictive model app that tells you how your blood sugar is going to respond to any meal you eat. Based on that model, they now can create customized diets for their clients so they can successfully avoid high blood sugar levels that cause energy dips, excessive hunger, weight gain and increased risk of obesity and diabetes. As part of their program, they also provide suggested meals, snacks and the services of a dietician.Along these same lines, recent research has shown that your genetic background is not as influential in your microbiome as you might have thought. It is less genetics than a reflection of the people you live with, the foods, drugs and drinks you consume, and your lifestyle. That's why DayTwo's assessment methodology is so innovative—it helps you identify the right diet for your personal ""gut.""Think about the implications of this approachYour health to a very large extent stems from how your body processes food. The trillions of bacteria that live in your gut, which differ greatly from person to person, are part of how you uniquely respond to food. Different people have different blood sugar responses to the same foods, which is why it is essential to understand what your particular body needs—and to eat accordingly. Wanting to bring this groundbreaking technology from Isreal to the U.S., Lihi and DayTwo helped the Mayo Clinic replicate the Weizmann Institute trial which got the same results. Heidi Nelson, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine Microbiome Program, explains: ""We have long wondered why one diet works for one person, but not another. Now, we are beginning to understand that how a person processes food depends upon that individual's gut microbiome, immune system and the community of bacteria in the gut. Given these multiple factors, we are exploring ways to develop customized diets that will maintain wellness and prevent the development of disease.""Nelson adds: ""Glucose levels are abnormally high in patients with diabetes, and traditional interventions to control glucose levels have had limited benefit for them. These study results highlight the important role that personalized diets can play in maintaining better control over blood glucose levels and overall health.""How do you get started with DayTwo?As Lihi tells us in the podcast, just go to DayTwo's website and order your home testing kit online, which contains everything you need. In addition, over 200 clinics in the U.S. have signed up with her program. Better health is actually attainable for all of us.Some background on LihiLihi Segal has over 20 years of experience leading business and financial operations, spanning Interoperability and Health Information Exchange (HIE), Population Management, Electronic Health Records and Analytics. Before launching DayTwo, Lihi was COO and CFO of Sisense, a leading provider of business intelligence and analytics software, and CFO of dbMotion Ltd. where she was instrumental in growing the company up until its acquisition by Allscripts Healthcare, a leading U.S. EMR company. Prior to that, Lihi held senior roles in a number of businesses, from startups to large public enterprises. She is also a lawyer with an LLB from Tel-Aviv University and an MBA from Northwestern University.Additional resources:Download the 1-page synopsis of my book, ""On the Brink: A Fresh Lens to Take Your Business to New Heights"" here",https://t.co/0ab8Xp49Tv,news
Is 'Exercise Snacking' the New Way to Help Manage Blood Sugar?,"For those trying to manage blood sugar, a healthy diet is key. However, while food choice is important, getting adequate physical activity is, too.Many Americans fall short when it comes to the U.S. federal guidelines for physical activity, and this is especially true for people with type 2 diabetes. Research has shown that just 39 percent of people with type 2 diabetes engage in regular physical activity, compared to the 58 percent without diabetes who engage in regular physical activity (1). While taking up a new exercise routine may sound daunting, the truth is that those looking to improve their blood sugar control can reap some powerful benefits from adding a relatively small amount of physical activity into their routines.""Exercise snacking"" is similar to the idea of consuming small meals throughout the day, but involves breaking up exercise into small bouts throughout the day. This is helpful for those who have trouble getting the recommended amount of physical activity each day. The best part? Research has shown that this strategy works just as well or even better for blood sugar control than engaging in a single continuous bout of physical activity daily (2).A study published in the journal Diabetologia tested the blood-sugar status of exercisers engaging in short, one-minute bouts of high-intensity exercise before meals, six times per day against an exercise group engaging in traditional continuous bouts of moderate-intensity physical activity for 30 minutes, once per day. The participants in the study were all beginning to show signs of insulin resistance, which is an early symptom in the development of type 2 diabetes—meaning their bodies were beginning to have trouble maintaining normal blood sugar levels (3).The study found that those who completed just one minute of very high-intensity exercise before meals saw reduced blood sugar markers following their meals, and even more impressively, had lower blood sugar markers after 24 hours, when compared to the group that completed single 30-minute exercise sessions at a moderate intensity (2).This isn't the first time researchers have considered the benefits of breaking up exercises into shorter sessions. Another study found that 15-minute walks following meals was an effective strategy for quickly lowering blood sugar after meals in older individuals (4). Others in the fitness industry have speculated that shorter bouts of exercise spread throughout the day could be an effective way to encourage those who do not have an interest in traditional exercise routines.Diabetes is a growing issue in the United States and around the world, but these studies highlight that simple lifestyle changes like adding some exercise into your routine can make all the difference. According to the 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""an estimated 33.9% of U.S. adults aged 18 years or older (84.1 million people) had pre-diabetes in 2015"" (5). And according to the American Diabetes Association, ""the total direct and indirect estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2012 was $245 billion"" (6).The development of pre-diabetes and diabetes is both costly and can lead to other more serious health complications. The good news is that adopting a more healthful lifestyle can help manage your risk. Healthy diet choices and increased physical activity can help to delay or even prevent progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes (7). If something as simple as a few minutes of exercise spread throughout the day can help, it may be time for more people to give ""exercise snacking"" a try.References:Morrato EH, Hill JO, Wyatt HR, Ghushchyan V, Sullivan PW.

Can you drink coffee if you have type 2 diabetes? How caffeine affects blood sugar levels,"Can you drink coffee if you have type 2 diabetes? How caffeine affects blood sugar levels&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Type 2 diabetes can cause a wide range of symptoms, including excessive thirst and hunger, fatigue, frequent urination, weight loss, blurry vision, etc. This condition causes blood sugar levels to rise higher than normal and lead to serious complications if left untreated or not managed well. A healthy lifestyle, which consists of a balanced diet and exercise, can help stabilise blood sugar in most patients. However, certain foods and drinks can have blood sugar-lowering properties, and research suggests that coffee may help lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Once condemned as bad for your health, coffee has remarkably gained limelight in recent years owing to its potential health benefits. Yet, growing evidence shows that coffee may help prevent or reduce the risk of certain cancers, liver disease, cardiovascular problems, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and aid weight loss.Coffee for type 2 diabetes: Does it really work and how does caffeine affect your blood sugar?Studies on the health benefits of coffee for type 2 diabetes have shown different results. This could be due to the fact that coffee contains different compounds, some of which have beneficial effects, while others can be unhelpful for blood sugar levels - such as caffeine which can impair both glucose and insulin levels.For instance, a 2012 study reported that drinking 2-3 cups of coffee per day may help reduce the risk of diabetes. The researchers also found that regularly drinking 4 cups of coffee a day could lower blood sugar - both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees showed the same results, as per this study. Also, a 2009 study of 40,000 participants showed that taking 3 cups of tea or coffee per day caused a 40% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.However, it may be noted that exceeding four cups of coffee a day may increase your blood pressure. Moreover, it's worth noting that coffee or tea should not be used as your main source of fluid, instead, you can include it as part of a balanced diet.Researchers also found a link between caffeine and blood sugar levels. A 2004 study showed that taking caffeine before eating caused higher post-meal blood sugar in type 2 diabetes patients. It also led to an increase in insulin resistance. a recent 2018 study, there may be a genetic proponent involved. A 2018 study suggested that genes may play a role in caffeine metabolism and how it affects blood sugar levels.Additionally, coffee has been shown to offer many health benefits that aren't linked to diabetes prevention.Tips for adding coffee to your dietIt may not be a healthy option to start drinking coffee to help prevent or manage diabetes, although there's growing evidence suggesting that the ingredient could be beneficial. Adding coffee to your diet as part of a healthy eating plan may be good, especially if you already drink it. But make sure that you reduce the amount of sugar or milk you consume with your coffee.If you have type 2 diabetes or are at risk of developing the condition, you should focus on making healthier lifestyle choices such as eating a balanced diet consisting of fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, exercising and losing weight. Also, consult your doctor or a dietician about diet options and the potential effects that coffee can have on you.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

However, initial studies are quite promising. Test tube studies have proved that cloves played a good role in stopping the tumors from growing further. It also caused the death of cancer cells. At least 2 types of cancer cells, those related to ovarian cancer and esophageal cancer cells were tested for this purpose. Very concentrated clove oil killed close to 80% of the cancer cells, which was a great discovery indeed!However, the only problem here is that it is not advisable to consume clove extracts or oil at such a high concentration rate. Further studies are being conducted to understand how cloves can be used to prevent cancers without causing any side effects.Cloves come with a bevy of health benefits you thought never existedSide Effects Of Cloves: Are There Any Side Effects Of Cloves?After reading all these benefits of cloves,you might be tempted to include them in your daily diet.

Type 2 diabetes: Best bread to eat if you want to lower your blood sugar,"Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that can trigger symptoms such as needing to pee more than usual, feeling thirsty all the time and feeling very tired. But because these symptoms don't necessarily make you feel unwell, the condition can be difficult to identify. If you experience these symptoms or unexplained weight loss, itching around the penis or vagina and blurred vision you should see your GP. Type 2 diabetes complications that occur if the condition is left untreated include problems with the nerves, kidneys, eyes, feet, and heart attack and stroke. When it comes to managing your blood sugar level, whether you have the condition or not, it's important to eat a healthy diet. There's nothing you can't eat if you have type 2 diabetes says the NHS, but you'll have to limit certain foods.You should eat a wide range of food including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta.Sugar, fat and salt should be kept to a minimum and your should also make sure not to skip meals and eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day.When it comes to one of the staples of many people's diet, bread, which is best for blood sugar levels?Many breads are high in carbohydrates which can quickly raise blood sugar levels.As a result of this, eating large quantities of many breads should be avoided. But, pumpernickel bread and 100 per cent stone-ground whole wheat breads have low GI scores.GI stands for glycemic index and is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.Pumpernickel and stone-ground whole wheat breads have lower GI scores than regular whole wheat bread because the ingredients go through less processing.During processing the fibrous outer shells of grains and cereals is removed.Fibre slows digestion and helps to stabilise blood sugar levels. A 2014 study found spelt and rye bread used low initial glycemic responses in rats. Diabetes UK also advises: ""Choosing wholegrain options makes sense. They are high in fire, keep you feeling fuller for longer than refined carbohydrates and take longer for the body to break down so blood glucose levels do not 'spike' then drop rapidly.""But if pumpernickel bread doesn't whet your appetite, wholegrain, granary, spelt and rye bread are also recommended.Other carbohydrates you should opt for include wholewheat or brown pasta and noodles, basmati or wild rice, porridge oats or muesli, and quinoa, burger wheat, couscous or yam.Alongside eating a healthy diet, expert recommend being active.

Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,"" Platt, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,"" Colberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""For example, the message 'seek medical help' is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,"" Colberg added. ""Self-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps."" SOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.",https://t.co/2KjyDZ8rJG,news
Dietary carbohydrate restriction as the first approach in diabetes management: Critical review and evidence base,"JavaScript is disabled on your browser. Please enable JavaScript to use all the features on this page.Critical reviewDietary carbohydrate restriction as the first approach in diabetes management: Critical review and evidence baseHighlights•We present major evidence for low-carbohydrate diets as first approach for diabetes.•Such diets reliably reduce high blood glucose, the most salient feature of diabetes.•Benefits do not require weight loss although nothing is better for weight reduction.•Carbohydrate-restricted diets reduce or eliminate need for medication.•There are no side effects comparable with those seen in intensive pharmacologic treatment.AbstractThe inability of current recommendations to control the epidemic of diabetes, the specific failure of the prevailing low-fat diets to improve obesity, cardiovascular risk, or general health and the persistent reports of some serious side effects of commonly prescribed diabetic medications, in combination with the continued success of low-carbohydrate diets in the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome without significant side effects, point to the need for a reappraisal of dietary guidelines. The benefits of carbohydrate restriction in diabetes are immediate and well documented. Concerns about the efficacy and safety are long term and conjectural rather than data driven. Dietary carbohydrate restriction reliably reduces high blood glucose, does not require weight loss (although is still best for weight loss), and leads to the reduction or elimination of medication. It has never shown side effects comparable with those seen in many drugs. Here we present 12 points of evidence supporting the use of low-carbohydrate diets as the first approach to treating type 2 diabetes and as the most effective adjunct to pharmacology in type 1. They represent the best-documented, least controversial results. The insistence on long-term randomized controlled trials as the only kind of data that will be accepted is without precedent in science. The seriousness of diabetes requires that we evaluate all of the evidence that is available. The 12 points are sufficiently compelling that we feel that the burden of proof rests with those who are opposed.KeywordsDiabetesCarbohydrateLow-carbohydrate dietKetogenic dietTriglycerideHemoblobin A1cRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

The Best Exercise for Blood Sugar Control is Not What You Think,"When patients struggle with high bloodsugar, doctors often tell them to exercise more. They typically recommendwalking, jogging, biking, or some other kind of aerobic workout.New research has good news for patientswho hate running but still want to get their blood sugar under control.The study waspublished in the journal Diabetes/MetabolismResearch and Reviews. The research team recruited 172 subjects between theages of 55 and 75. All were prediabetic. That means they had high blood sugar,but not high enough to have full-blown diabetes.[1]The subjectswere randomly placed into one of four groups:A control group that did no exercise.A group that did aerobic dancing. They warmedup for five minutes, then danced for 50 minutes. They ended with five minutesof stretching.A group that did resistance training, such aschest presses, leg presses, pull downs, and shoulder presses. They did60-minute workouts.A group that did a combination of the aerobic andresistance exercises.

Study: Even Healthy People Get Blood Sugar Spikes,"TUESDAY, July 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- You'd expect big blood sugar fluctuations in people with diabetes. But for those without the disorder, blood sugar levels should remain fairly stable, right? Maybe not, says a new study. Researchers found some people who don't have diabetes still have wild swings in their blood sugar levels after they eat. Among nearly 60 participants, the study authors identified three ""glucotypes"" based on how much blood sugar spiked after eating -- low, moderate and severe. The study also found that certain foods were more likely to prompt an extreme change in blood sugar (glucose) than others. ""Even if you don't have diabetes, you may not have normal glucose. There are a lot of people with glucose dysfunction out there who don't know it,"" said the study's lead author, Michael Snyder. He's director of genomics and personalized medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine, in California. Snyder said this finding is potentially concerning because spikes in blood sugar levels have been associated with risk of heart attack and stroke. And it's possible -- though it hasn't been proven in this study -- that people who have big rises in their blood sugar after eating may have a higher risk of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem, affecting more than 30 million U.S. adults and 422 million worldwide, the authors noted. But not every medical expert is convinced that these changes in blood sugar in healthy people are something to be concerned about. Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, pointed out that the study population was small. That makes it difficult to draw conclusions about blood sugar pattern ""types,"" he said. Zonszein was not involved with the research. The study volunteers ""were separated into low, moderate and severe spikes. But there may be many other patterns,"" he said. ""Absorption, storage and utilization of [sugars] is highly regulated and difficult to characterize by only three different patterns."" Zonszein added that blood sugar metabolism is complex and affected by many different variables.",https://t.co/Co59BUnCE5,news

"Do you lose nutrients when juicing fruits and veggies? Yes, actually","But when juicing fruits and vegetables, some of the healthy, filling fiber is lost. That's because juice extractors separate the juice from the fiber-rich pulp and skins. ""You do lose fiber in fruit and vegetable juices, and that results in juices having the ability to spike your blood sugar in a more dramatic way than if you ate the actual fruit or vegetable,"" said Robin Foroutan, an integrative medicine dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. In addition to fiber, you also lose some polyphenols and antioxidants found in the pith of citrus fruits and skins of fruits and vegetables that may not be extracted as effectively in home juicing, explained Mario G. Ferruzzi, a professor in the Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences at North Carolina State University.If you do choose to juice, don't delay drinking. ""It is best to drink the juice right away, because antioxidant and enzyme activity decreases over time,"" Foroutan said. Antioxidants help to balance inflammation, while enzymes (like those found in pineapple) help with digestion. If you are juicing and plan on drinking the juice later, it's best to store it in an airtight glass container, refrigerate and consume within one day, Foroutan explained.Cold-pressed juicers don't create heat the way centrifuge juicers do, and heat destroys enzymes in produce. However, centrifuge juicers likely don't get hot enough to actually destroy enzymes or oxidize nutrients, Foroutan explained. ""I don't think the heat generated would be enough that it would kill enzymes or nutrients in the way cooking does,"" Foroutan said. Minimizing nutrient losses in juiceTo minimize fiber loss, you can combine some of the pulp back into the juice. You can also salvage the pulp by using it to fortify other foods, such as cake or muffin batters, cooked rice or soups, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Another option is to use a food processor or blender instead of a juicer to make fruit or vegetable juice. This will allow the fiber-rich pulp to remain in the juice, which can keep you feeling fuller longer.One study revealed that blending provides other benefits over juicing. Specifically, juices that had been prepared by blending whole fruits had stronger antioxidant activities and contained larger amounts of phenolic compounds than juices that had been prepared by juicing the flesh of fruit. However, levels of vitamin C in apple, pear and mandarin orange juice was significantly higher in juice that had been processed by juicing, rather than blending. The last dropWhile juicing can help you consume important nutrients, it shouldn't displace whole fruits and vegetables in your diet. Also, simply changing the form of fruits and veggies won't help you lose weight or get rid of toxins, despite popular health claims. In fact, limiting your diet to drinking fruit or vegetables can cause you to miss out on important nutrients such as protein and healthy fats. Finally, keep in mind that while juices contain natural sugars, they are still a concentrated source of calories, even for some vegetable juices such as carrot or beet. So if you are watching your blood sugar levels or trying to keep carbs or calories in check, be sure to watch your portions of juice and limit to 4 ounces, or ½ cup.

Diabetes diet: The best breakfast to eat to keep blood sugar stable,"Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that occurs when the insulin in the pancreas doesn't work properly or it can't produce enough insulin. It is important for type 2 diabetics to understand and control their blood glucose levels, as having high levels of sugar in the blood for long periods of time increases the risk of diabetes complications developing. It could also cause serious health problems such as kidney disease, nerve damage, retinal disease, heart disease and stroke. Some breakfast cereals contain shockingly high levels of sugar that for type 2 diabetics is a real no-go. The biggest culprits are granola with chocolate containing 24g of sugar, granola with dried fruit, nuts or seeds containing 10.8g, and sugar frosted cornflakes containing 11.5g of sugar.To put it into perspective, The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends woman to consume only 25g of sugar and men 37.5g of sugar a day.Oats have been proven to be the best breakfast for diabetics. Oats improve insulin sensitivity and are one of the healthiest grains on earth.Studies show that oats have many health benefits which include weight loss, lower blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.Despite being a high-carb food it is highly recommended for people with diabetes to opt for the oats in the morning. The main benefits for consuming oats for breakfast include:Low GI scoreTo work out how certain foods will raise your blood sugar, the Glycemic Index (GI) is used. Foods which contain lower GI scores are perfect for diabetics as it will not raise the blood glucose levels and oats contain low-levels of GI.Fibre-RichFibre does not raise blood glucose levels as it is not broken down by the body. It also aids in digestion and helps slow down the breakdown of sugars in the body. Oats contain 8g of fibre and helps with managing weight.Lowers blood sugarOats contains specific types of fibres known beta glucans. They are sugars that are found in the cell walls of bacteria or yeasts such as oats. They are used for high diabetes as they lower the sugar in your blood.Feeling fuller for longerThe benefits of eating a low GI and fibre-rich foods is that it keeps the body feeling fuller for longer. This helps avoid snacking throughout the day and will keep a healthy balance on your blood sugar levels. It is highly recommended that you should check all food packaging for ingredients and amounts of sugar as packaging can often be misleading.The NHS said: ""Nutrition labels can help you choose between products and keep a check on the amount of foods you're eating that are high in fat, salt and added sugars.""Most pre-packed food products have a list of ingredients on the packaging or attached label.""The ingredient list can help you work out how healthy the product is. Ingredients are listed in order of weight, so the main ingredients in the packaged food always comes first so if the first few ingredients are high-sugar its best to avoid for diabetics.""Breakfast is truly the most important meal of the day and for type 2 diabetics, oats is the best option to lower blood sugar levels and keep you feeling fuller for longer.

Type 2 diabetes: Eat pumpernickel bread to lower your blood sugar,"Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that can trigger symptoms such as needing to pee more than usual, feeling thirsty all the time and feeling very tired. But because these symptoms don't necessarily make you feel unwell, the condition can be difficult to identify. If you experience these symptoms or unexplained weight loss, itching around the penis or vagina and blurred vision you should see your GP. Type 2 diabetes complications that occur if the condition is left untreated include problems with the nerves, kidneys, eyes, feet, and heart attack and stroke. When it comes to managing your blood sugar level, whether you have the condition or not, it's important to eat a healthy diet.There's nothing you can't eat if you have type 2 diabetes says the NHS, but you'll have to limit certain foods.You should eat a wide range of food including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta.Sugar, fat and salt should be kept to a minimum and your should also make sure not to skip meals and eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day.When it comes to one of the staples of many people's diet, bread, which is best for blood sugar levels?Many breads are high in carbohydrates which can quickly raise blood sugar levels.As a result of this, eating large quantities of many breads should be avoided.But, pumpernickel bread and 100 per cent stone-ground whole wheat breads have low GI scores.GI stands for glycemic index and is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.Pumpernickel and stone-ground whole wheat breads have lower GI scores than regular whole wheat bread because the ingredients go through less processing.During processing the fibrous outer shells of grains and cereals is removed.Fibre slows digestion and helps to stabilise blood sugar levels.A 2014 study found spelt and rye bread used low initial glycemic responses in rats. Diabetes UK also advises: ""Choosing wholegrain options makes sense. They are high in fire, keep you feeling fuller for longer than refined carbohydrates and take longer for the body to break down so blood glucose levels do not 'spike' then drop rapidly.""But if pumpernickel bread doesn't whet your appetite, wholegrain, granary, spelt and rye bread are also recommended.Other carbohydrates you should opt for include wholewheat or brown pasta and noodles, basmati or wild rice, porridge oats or muesli, and quinoa, burger wheat, couscous or yam.Alongside eating a healthy diet, expert recommend being active.

Back on course: Golf enthusiast learns to control his diabetes,"Outpatient diabetes classes provide information and supportIt came without warning signs or symptoms. After a routine blood test this past November, Om Bhasin was told to get to the Emergency Center at Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak ASAP. His blood sugar levels were soaring. Abnormally high levels of blood sugar, a condition known as hyperglycemia, can be life-threatening. Left untreated, hyperglycemia can cause a deadly coma. Om's diagnosisBhasin, a resident of West Bloomfield, underwent further testing at Beaumont. His diagnosis: Type 2 diabetes. He was admitted and for four days the medical team, under the direction of endocrinologist Dr. Robert Igwe, worked to lower his blood sugar levels. It included insulin injections and following a meal plan.When admitted, Bhasin's A1C was 13.2%, compared to the norm of below 4.6%. This A1C blood test, an important tool in diabetes management, provides an average of blood sugar readings from the past 2-3 months. It's been compared to a player's batting average, or a student's report card. An A1C above 6.5% is a diagnosis for diabetes.'I experienced no symptoms'""I was startled,"" recalled Bhasin, 74, when they told him he had diabetes. ""I experienced no symptoms. It caught me off guard, because I have no family history of diabetes.""Because many, like Bhasin, have no warning signs or symptoms, Type 2 diabetes has been called insidious or sneaky. While it is estimated 27 million Americans have Type 2 diabetes, alarmingly, nearly 1 in 4 do not even know they have it.Bhasin hardly fits the stereotype of the overweight couch potato who develops Type 2 diabetes. He's fit and active, exercising three days a week at LA Fitness and during the golf season, playing 2-3 times a week. He retired from Ford Motor Company in 2015 and had a kidney transplant procedure in 2017.9% of Americans have diabetesType 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 90 to 95% of all Americans diagnosed with this metabolic disorder. All told, approximately 30 million children and adults in the U.S. have some type of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, or gestational. That's 9% of Americans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the number is growing.Diabetes is a chronic, widespread condition characterized by high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia. When the body does not produce or properly use insulin, blood sugar levels rise. Insulin is a hormone needed to transport sugar from the blood into the cells of the body for energy. Diabetes complications can include: blindness, kidney disease, stroke, neuropathy and heart attack. It's the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. While there is no cure for diabetes, it can be managed.Education is keyFast forward six months, Bhasin is golfing with former co-workers in Livonia. He's grateful for the care and support he's received since his diagnosis and credits Dr. Igwe and diabetes educators with giving him the tools to self-manage his diabetes. He participated in the Diabetes Outpatient Education program at Beaumont, Royal Oak.""The program was extremely beneficial. My wife also attended,"" said Bhasin. ""It gave me practical tips and guidance in managing my diabetes.""Program topics include: treatment options monitoring blood sugar levels meal planning effects of exercise reducing/preventing complications medications community resourcesGloria Verdi, RN, certified diabetes educator and program coordinator explained, ""Our program is open to those recently diagnosed, like Om, and also those who've worked at managing their diabetes for years and are seeking new insights. Our team strives to provide the tools, guidance and confidence needed to successfully manage diabetes.""Bhasin quickly applied what he learned in the program. He liked meeting one-on-one with Lindsay Beresh, registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator, to discuss meal planning.""The tips for dividing your plate in three portions, along with suggestions for eating at restaurants were helpful,"" said Bhasin. ""Whenever possible, I go online and study a restaurant's menu. I focus on nutritional values of menu items, including, carbs, proteins and calories.""He's also learned how to adjust his insulin dosage based on his activities. When exercising he monitors his blood sugar every 20 minutes and carries orange juice in his gym bag.Bhasin appreciates his wife's support, too, ""It's wise to have your spouse or partner attend your diabetes education classes. She now has a better understanding of diabetes and the importance of self-management.""On his recent visit to Dr. Igwe, Bhasin's A1C blood score was 5%, well within the normal range – quite a contrast to his earlier score of 13.2%.""Given my lack of symptoms, I was fortunate my diabetes was diagnosed when it was,"" said Bhasin.The Outpatient Diabetes Education Programs at Beaumont hospitals in Grosse Pointe, Royal Oak and Troy are certified by the Michigan Department of Community Health and recognized by the American Diabetes Association for quality self-management education. The nurse educators and registered dietitians are certified diabetes educators.A physician referral is required to attend. Some health insurance plans cover the class fee.

Best Blood Sugar-Balancing Breakfast Recipe,"Early into my first hospital job, I used to wait to eat breakfast until after morning rounds. Um, yeah, that was a bad idea. Even when I tried to have a snack like a piece of fruit beforehand, I found myself feeling irritable and impatient, ravenous and unable to really concentrate on what other team members were saying—not conducive to a productive day.In retrospect it's silly, but I remember feeling pressured to hold out because that's what I saw my new coworkers doing, but as a morning exerciser who doesn't function well without a solid breakfast, I got over that pretty quickly. It took about a month of white-knuckling it to realize waiting to eat until 9 a.m. — four hours after I'd woken up — was just not going to work. Besides, who wants to be the ragey new girl?Instead, I started eating before rounds so that by the time I got there, I was focused, energized, and ready to start seeing patients after the meeting. It was a total game-changer. Even now that I no longer work in a hospital setting, a balanced breakfast is a must.The reason a balanced morning meal is so important is because it supports stable blood sugar, which is essential to maintaining your energy and a positive mood—key to having a productive, enjoyable day with smooth interactions.Here's a simple explanation to spare you the gray hairs I got in biochemistry class: Consuming protein and fat along with carbohydrates buffers the breakdown of those carbs, slowing digestion so you don't experience a sharp spike and then crash in blood sugar. Fiber also helps slow the process, which is why foods like berries, whole grains, sweet potatoes, and beans are a better choice compared to more refined carbs like white bread, pastries, and white potatoes.When helping my clients establish sustainable routines, breakfast is almost always part of the discussion. How are you fueling your morning? How can you make it easy and enjoyable to stay on track with your goals?A common mistake I see is someone eating a big bowl of oatmeal with banana and drinking a (sugar-sweetened) almond milk latte, then wondering why they're starving shortly after. Sure, you're getting plenty of complex carbs and fiber, but almost zero fat or protein to balance out the meal. Another big one: Gulping down a smoothie with three servings worth of fruit (it can be hard to tell how much is in there when it's all getting liquified) with sweetened almond milk and maybe a tablespoon of nut butter, which isn't enough to balance out all the carbs in the fruit and sugar in the almond milk, so they wind up wiped and hangry come 10 a.m.The good news is that there are lots of delicious ways to balance your blood sugar in the morning. Here are my top five blood sugar–balancing breakfasts.",https://t.co/snEpshj5lt,news

Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,"" Platt, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,"" Colberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""For example, the message 'seek medical help' is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,"" Colberg added. ""Self-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps."" SOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.",https://t.co/56nCS5bS0F,news

Type 2 diabetes: Drinking this type of tea may help to prevent blood sugar rises,"Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications with the heart, eyes, nerves, kidneys and feet if not controlled properly. Medication is often used to keep the condition under control, but it's also important to follow a healthy diet that is low in sugar, calories and fat. As well as cutting down on unhealthy foods, you may be able to keep type 2 diabetes under control by consuming foods which can help to improve insulin sensitivity and therefore blood sugar levels. According to Diabetes.co.uk, tea is one drink which may be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes.The diabetes expert notes research has shown tea may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the first place.This is because certain types of tea contain micronutrients called polyphenols, which may increase insulin activity.Polyphenols are packed with antioxidants which can help protect against inflammation and carcinogens - properties which can help prevent type 2 diabetes.However, Diabetes.co.uk notes one study of the popular drink found adding milk decreased the insulin-sensitising effects.The best type of tea to help improve insulin activity is therefore tea without milk, such as black tea, green tea and oolong tea.According to the diabetes expert, a 2009 study showed drinking three cups of tea per day could reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 40 per cent.""Tea is one of the nation's favourite drinks and research suggests it's also a healthy drink,"" said Diabetes.co.uk.""Tea brings a number of health benefits including improving insulin sensitivity.""""However, research notes that some the benefits are best experienced if you drink your tea without milk.""Improving insulin sensitivity is important for people with type 2 diabetes as they either don't produce enough of it or the insulin they do produce is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to control the level of sugar in the blood and transfer it to the cells to be turned into energy.If it is unable to do this, too much sugar will remain in the blood, which is how people develop type 2 diabetes.People with type 2 diabetes are also advised to eat more fruit and vegetables in order to maintain a healthy diet and keep the condition under control.Experts advise that even though fruit contains natural sugars, this is outweighed by the health benefits provided by the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients it has.It's important to cut down on foods high in calories and fat, as these can lead to weight gain, which can increase the risk of diabetes-associated complications.People who are overweight are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in the first place.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.",https://t.co/ohlWfoZBwB,news

Broccoli to cure diabetes is known as the anti-diabetes super-hero. Blueberries Blueberries contain both, insoluble fibre which flushes fatout of your system and soluble fibre which slows down the emptying of yourstomach and improves blood sugar control.

Naturalchemicals in the berries, shrinks fat cells and stimulates the release ofadiponectin hormones which regulates blood glucose levels amongst other things.Fish Fish contains a special type of fat that helps cool inflammation.

A fish rich diet can also reduce your risk of developing problems, especially stroke, so it is important to cure diabetes. People who ate baked, boiled or steamed fish reduced their odds for a stroke by 3%. Apples There is a reason why people say – an apple a day keeps the doctor away. This fruit is high in fibre and vitamin C. Being high in fibre means that consistent apple consumption has a positive effect to cure diabetes. A study found that those who are eating 5 or more apples a week have a 23% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, compared with subjects who don't eat any apples. Avocados Avocados are high in monounsaturated fats which aregenerally considered among the healthiest of fats. Monounsaturated fats alsoimprove heart health and is an important benefit for diabetics who haveincreased risk of heart disease and stroke. Beans Packed with protein and cholesterol, white cannellini beans,are slow to raise blood sugar.

How to Exercise Safely With Diabetes | Newsmax.com,"If you have diabetes exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. According to the experts at Harvard Medical School, it can improve your sensitivity to insulin and help build muscles while shedding excess fat — all of which goes a long way to keeping your blood sugar levels under control.However, there are certain precautions you should take because of the inherent dangers of the disease. First, always check with your doctor before starting or changing a fitness routine.""This is especially important if you are overweight or have a history of heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetic neuropathy,"" say the Harvard team of experts. In general, the best time to exercise is one to three hours after eating, when your blood sugar level is likely to be higher. If you use insulin, it's important to test your blood sugar before exercising.""If the level before exercise is below 100mg/dl, eating a piece of fruit or having a small snack will boost it and help you avoid hypoglycemia,"" the Harvard experts add. ""Testing again 30 minutes later will show whether or not your blood sugar level is stable.""The experts advise that people with diabetes should always wear a medical alert bracelet indicating that you have the disease and take insulin. They also recommend keeping hard candy or glucose tablets with you while exercising in case your blood sugar level drops precariously low.The American Diabetes Association recommends both aerobic exercise and strength training for those living with diabetes.""Aerobic exercise helps your body use insulin better,"" says the ADA. ""It makes your heart and bones strong, relieves stress, improves blood circulation, and reduces your risk of heart disease by lowering blood glucose and blood pressure and improving cholesterol levels.""The ADA recommends starting slowly and aiming for 30 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic activity at least five days a week. Some examples include brisk walking either outside or on a treadmill, bicycling, dancing, water aerobics, swimming, playing tennis, hiking or roller skating.Strength training, also known as resistance training, makes your body more sensitive to insulin and can lower blood glucose. It helps maintain and build strong muscles and bones, reducing your risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. ""Also, the more muscles you have, the more calories you burn even when your body is at rest,"" says the ADA.The recommendations include some form of strength training at least twice weekly in addition to aerobic exercise. You can use free weights or weight machines at the gym, use resistance bands, do squats and pushups or take classes that involve strength training. Kick boxing is an excellent way to combine both aerobic movement and strength training. The American Diabetes Association has several suggestions on how to incorporate fitness into your wellness program. Log on to www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/. © 2019 NewsmaxHealth.

Type 2 diabetes: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?,"Type 2 diabetes management: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?&amp;nbsp New Delhi: You may have heard that drumstick or Moringa oleifera leaves can help maintain blood sugar levels, making it an effective natural remedy to manage diabetes. The plant, often referred to as the miracle tree, has been used for centuries owing to its health benefits. Studies have shown that moringa oleifera contains beneficial antioxidants and bioactive compounds that can help treat and prevent diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, respiratory and skin problems. The moringa tree, which is native to India, is also known by other names such as horseradish tree or ben oil tree.Type 2 diabetes is a major global public health problem that can lead to serious complications if controlled poorly. The condition raises blood glucose (sugar) levels, also known as hyperglycaemia, which may cause damage to the eye, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels. Keeping blood sugar along with body weight under control through a combination of a healthy lifestyle and standard treatment is an important part of diabetes management. Studies show certain herbs and spices blood sugar-lowering properties, and one such being drumstick leaves. Take a look at how this plant can be useful in controlling diabetes.Can Moringa leaves help treat diabetes?Various studies showed effects of moringa leaves on lowering blood sugar levels in diabetes patients and animals, indicating that the plant can be used as a natural way to combat the disease. One study involving 30 women reported that consuming 7 grams of moringa leaf powder everyday for three months helped reduce fasting blood sugar levels 13.5 per cent, on average.Similarly, another small study found that using moringa leaves - about 50 grams - in a meal reduced the rise in blood sugar by some 21 per cent. However, it may be noted that more work is required before making any solid recommendations.Research showed that plant compounds such as isothiocyanates in moringa can help reduce body weight, improve glucose tolerance and insulin signaling in mice fed very high-fat diet (VHFD) supplemented with 5% moringa concentrate (MC). The results also revealed that these mice did not develop fatty liver disease compared to VHFD-fed mice.It is claimed that moringa can help reduce the amount of sugar in the blood, as well as glucose and protein in the urine, which may help treat diabetes.Benefits and risks of Moringa leavesMoringa oleifera is has been used in traditional herbal medicines for many years. The plant is believed to offer many benefits and its uses range from beauty to preventing and curing diseases - such as asthma, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, digestive issues, etc.Moringa leaves are packed with nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are good for your health. However, consuming it is not recommended for pregnant women as moringa may possess anti-fertility qualities. If you have diabetes and are considering using moringa, we suggest you discuss it with your doctor first.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

"Eat More Okra: It Prevents Blood Sugar Spikes, Protects the Liver, Brain and Much More","Okra is an incredibly beneficial and versatile fruit that offers a plethora of health benefits and can be used in various ways in the kitchen. Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus, or Hibiscus esculentus) is a flowering plant that belongs to the mallow family (Malvaceae) and produces large yellow flowers and a pod that measures 4-10 inches. It grows in warm climates in South America, the Middle East, and in the southern United States. It is technically a fruit, but is eaten as a vegetable due to the rather savory taste, and is also known as lady's fingers (or, ladies fingers), bhindi, bendakaya, bamia or gumbo. When boiled, it becomes thick, so it is often added to soups, broths, and stews. It can also be pickled, fried, or sautéed. It is a rich source of minerals and vitamins, as well as fiber. A cup of okra provides about 40% your recommended daily vitamin C needs, which boosts the immune system, high amounts of vitamin K that boosts bone health and improves blood clotting, vitamin A, that improves vision and prevents free radical damage, as well as magnesium, potassium, calcium, iron, zinc, and folate.Magnesium regulates blood pressure and blood sugar levels, potassium and calcium improve bone health and muscle function, and folate is essential during pregnancy, and it improves brain function and prevents anemia. Iron ensures the health of the blood, zinc protects DNA and strengthens the immune system, while the dietary fiber improves digestion, and the multiple antioxidants eliminate free radicals. Here are some of the numerous health benefits of okra:Okra prevents blood sugar spikes after meals and reduces blood glucose levelsOkra protects the liver from damage and prevents liver diseaseOkra naturally boosts energy levels and treats fatigueOkra relieves stress and improves mood, and treats anxiety and depressionOkra has potent anti-cancer properties and reduces the size of tumors, especially skin and breast cancer cells It reduces glucose absorption, lowers blood sugar levels, and is beneficial in the treatment of type 2 diabetes The high amounts of dietary fiber keep you full and help weight loss Okra contains no fat but is rich in compounds that lower ""bad"" cholesterol levels Okra produces a gelatinous liquid which treats gastritis, peptic ulcers, and stomach aches Okra boosts the cognitive abilities and prevents diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative neurological diseasesOkra treats asthma symptoms and other respiratory conditions and cleanses the lungs Okra is generally safe to consume. However, note that okra can interact with some diabetes medications, and it should be avoided in case one suffers from gastrointestinal problems, kidney stones, vein thrombosis, and blood clotting. Always buy bright green okra pods, and avoid the ones with dark spots and cuts. You can eat the fruits fresh and slightly immature. You can keep okra in a brown paper bag in the refrigerator for no more than 2-3 days. Yet, you can also buy canned or dried okra. Okra water is one of the healthiest drinks, and here is how to prepare it:Wash 4 medium size okra pods, slice down their ends, poke them with a fork on opposite sides or split them in half, and place them in an 8-oz. glass of water. Leave them to soak overnight, and in the morning, squeeze the goopy substance from the pods, discard them, and drink the healthy remedy. Here are some tips that will help you cook okra and enjoy its delicious taste:Always cut the okra before adding to a dish, to prevent the early formation of slime Soak whole okra pods in vinegar or lemon juice for half an hour before cooking. Rinse well and dry before cutting and usingIf you add okra to thicken gumbo or stews, blanch the whole, uncut okra, and then add it chopped 10 minutes before the end of cooking.You can also try okra fritters by dipping okra slices into some beaten egg and cornmeal, pickle okra pods, or steam them sliced and add it to meat or rice and vegetables. Here are some tasty recipes worth trying:Pan-Fried Okra with CornmealIngredients2 pounds fresh okra, stems trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch pieces6 tablespoons canola oil, divided2/3 cup fine yellow cornmeal1 1/2 teaspoons coarse sea salt1 teaspoon black pepper1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepperInstructions:You will need two medium-size nonstick skillets, and place 1 1/2 tablespoons of the canola oil in each of them.

Type 2 diabetes: Lower your blood sugar by adding more of this bean to your diet,"Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by making lifestyle changes, including improving your diet. As well as cutting down on sugar and other unhealthy foods, adding more of other foods into your diet may also help to manage blood sugar levels. According to dietitian Juliette Kellow, one type of food that is beneficial to people with diabetes is pulses. Pulses are the dried seeds of legume plants, such as beans, chickpeas, lentils and dried peas, and kidney beans could be of particular significance.""Kidney beans are the star of the pulse world for their high fibre content, which is important for weight management and those with type 2 diabetes, plus they're rich in antioxidants,"" said Kellow.Although kidney beans are a standout performer, all types of pulses have benefits which may help to improve blood sugar levels, notes the dietitian.In one study, it was found regularly consuming large portions of pulses improved blood sugar control, making them ideal for people with type 2 diabetes.The study involved participants eating 200g, or 7oz, portions of pulses five times a week.Another large study found women who ate the highest, compared with the lowest, amounts of pulses reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by nearly a quarter.Other types of beans which fall into the pulses family include haricot beans, black-eyed beans and black beans.Kellow advises all people to include pulses in their diets, whether they have diabetes or not.Studies show a daily serving of 80g, or 3oz, of pulses offer the best health benefits, and the dietitian recommends choosing a variety of pulses to ensure a range of nutrients.All beans are nutrient rich, but canned varieties are a little less so than dried versions. If using canned pulses, choose those in water without added sugar or salt.""Good intakes of pulses are linked to a host of health benefits, reducing the risk of many age-related problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes,"" said Kellow.""They're also a great weight-loss food, and an excellent source of nutrients for all.""Type 2 diabetes happens in people whose bodies don't produce enough insulin, or the insulin produced is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to control the level of sugar in the blood and transfer it to the cells to be turned into energy.If insulin is unable to do this, too much sugar will remain in the blood, which can lead to serious health complications with the heart, kidneys, nerves, eyes and feet.As well as improving your diet, type 2 diabetes can be managed by exercising regularly, not smoking and limiting alcohol intake.Weight management is important for people with type 2 diabetes as people who are overweight are more likely to develop the condition and also more likely to suffer from the associated complications.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.",https://t.co/ZqVGt2I0Po,news
Tips to Optimize Your Blood Sugar Level,"Insulin is essential to staying alive; unfortunately, the vast majority of people have resistance to this essential hormone, speeding up the aging process and contributing to the development of degenerative diseases. Any meal high in grain and sugar carbs typically generates a rapid rise in blood glucose. To compensate, your pancreas secretes more insulin into your bloodstream to lower your blood sugar. Insulin, however, is also very efficient at lowering blood sugar by turning it into fat. The more you secrete, the more fat your body will accumulate. If you consistently consume a high-sugar, high-grain diet, your blood glucose level will be correspondingly high and over time your body becomes desensitized to insulin, requiring more and more of it to get the job done. Eventually, you become insulin resistant and prone to weight gain, and then full-blown diabetic.Prediabetes1 is defined as an elevation in fasting blood glucose between 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and 125 mg/dl. At 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, it formally becomes Type 2 diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 84.1 million American adults — about 1 in 3 — are prediabetic,2,3 and most are unaware of this fact.However, any fasting blood sugar regularly over 90 in my book suggests insulin resistance, and findings by the late Dr. Joseph Kraft — former chairman of the department of clinical pathology and nuclear medicine at Presence Saint Joseph's Hospital, Chicago, and author of ""Diabetes Epidemic and You: Should Everyone Be Tested?"" — suggests a whopping 80% of Americans are insulin resistant, and that's true even if your fasting glucose is normal.4,5The good news is that insulin resistance is one of the easiest health problems to correct. Below I review eight of my top tips for optimizing and maintaining a healthy blood sugar level.Tip No. 1 — Proper Meal TimingIntermittent fasting or compression of your eating window is a powerful approach that facilitates weight loss and helps reduce your risk of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes. In his book ""Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy and Sleep Well Every Night,"" Satchidananda Panda, Ph.D., cites research showing that 90 percent of people eat across a span of 12 hours a day, and many across even longer timespans, which is a clear prescription for metabolic disaster. Intermittent fasting, i.e., the cycling of feast (feeding) and famine (fasting) mimics the eating habits of our ancestors and restores your body to a more natural state that allows a whole host of metabolic benefits to occur.6With regard to insulin resistance, research shows intermittent fasting promotes insulin sensitivity and improves blood sugar management by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates.7While there are a number of different intermittent fasting protocols, my preference is fasting daily for 18 hours and eating all meals within a six-hour window. If you're new to the concept of intermittent fasting, consider starting by skipping breakfast and have your lunch and dinner within a six-hour timeframe, say 11 AM and 5 PM, making sure you stop eating three hours before going to bed. The latter is important, as it helps protect your mitochondrial function. Recent research8,9 shows men who are at risk of Type 2 diabetes can improve their glucose control, thereby lowering that risk, simply by eating all their meals within a nine-hour timeframe — even if they do not implement any other dietary changes. Research10,11 has also shown men who eat supper at least two hours before bedtime have a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer, and women have a 16% lower risk of breast cancer than those who eat dinner closer to bedtime. For more details on why late-night eating is so detrimental, see ""Eating Early Dinner Aids Weight Loss and Lowers Cancer Risk."" When you do eat, focus on healthy protein in moderate amounts and minimize net carbs like pasta and bread, exchanging them for healthy fats like butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and raw nuts. This will help shift you into fat burning mode. On a related side note, when eating, relax and take your time! Research shows rushed eating, which typically occurs when you're stressed, has a significant impact on your blood sugar level. When you become stressed your body also secretes cortisol and glucagon, both of which affect your blood sugar levels as well.12 You can learn more about this in ""How Stress Can Affect Your Blood Sugar Level.""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Click Here &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; AdvertisementTip No. 2 — Monitor Your Blood Sugar LevelAs mentioned, while prediabetes13 is clinically defined as having a fasting blood sugar level between 100 and 125 mg/dl, I strongly believe any blood sugar over 90 mg/dl puts you in the danger zone for insulin resistance. Your blood sugar is measured through a glucose test, of which there are four types:Fasting plasma glucose test — When you fast overnight and take your blood sample in the morning Oral glucose tolerance test — Similar to the fasting blood sugar test, overnight fasting is required for this, and the person's fasting blood sugar level is measured. Afterward, a sugary liquid is provided and the levels are then tested for the next two hours Hemoglobin A1C test — This test checks the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin and will indicate your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months Random plasma glucose test — This makes use of a blood sample that is taken at a random time You could also do 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring, which I've done in the past, although it's pricey and probably not necessary for most people. At the time, I used a Dexcom monitor, which involves inserting a sensor beneath your skin for a week, which takes continuous glucose readings every few minutes. It really helped me fine-tune and evaluate how different foods impacted my glucose levels, and helped me understand the importance of feast-famine cycling. All of that said, for most people, a simple at-home glucose test,14 where you prick your finger and deposit a drop of blood onto a glucose testing strip, will do the job. Ideally, test yourself two to three times a day: first thing in the morning, before your first meal, and a couple of hours after your last meal.Your blood glucose levels will vary throughout the day. According to conventional recommendations, if you are healthy and do not have diabetes, your fasting blood glucose upon waking should be below 100 mg/dL. I recommend aiming for a fasting (when you wake up) level below 90 mg/dL. Before meal time, your glucose level should read between 70 to 99 mg/dL. After meals — or what's called ""postprandial"" and is usually taken two hours after eating — the level should be below 140 mg/dL.There are two measurements used for blood sugar levels. In the U.S., the measurement is in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). In the U.K. and Canada, the measurement for blood sugar is in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). To convert to mg/dL, multiply the amount by 18. For example, if a person in the U.K. says that their blood glucose result is 7 mmol/L, in the U.S. it's read as 126 mg/dL.Tip No. 3 — Monitor Your Blood KetonesAnother valuable test is the blood ketone test, which will tell you whether you're in nutritional ketosis or not. I recommend starting your intermittent fasting routine and monitoring your blood ketones as you go along. The KetoCoachX monitor15 is currently one of the best and least expensive ketone monitors on the market.You're in nutritional ketosis once your blood ketone level is above 0.3 to 0.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).16 Ideally, perform the test first thing in the morning while still in a fasted state (i.e., before ingesting anything). Having a fasting ketone level above 1 mmol/L is a sign you're in deep ketosis. Once your fasting ketones are greater than 0.3 mmol/L, then you can start incorporating partial fasting as described in my book, ""KetoFast: Rejuvenate Your Health With a Step-by-Step Guide to Timing Your Ketogenic Meals."" The partial fasting regimen described in ""KetoFast"" essentially mimics ancestral eating patterns, allowing your body to work optimally by allowing for periods of breakdown and cleanout, and periods of rebuilding and rejuvenation.Among the many health benefits of cyclical fasting is improved circulating glucose and lipid levels.17 For a summary of my KetoFast protocol, see ""Avoid the Dark Side of Fasting and Ketosis With KetoFasting.""Tip No. 4 — Radically Limit Net Carbs Until You Are Metabolically FlexibleAlong with intermittent fasting, you'll also want to adopt a cyclical ketogenic diet, which involves radically limiting carbs (replacing them with healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein) until you're close to or at your ideal weight. As with intermittent fasting, this will allow your body to start using fat as its primary fuel rather than carbohydrates. Twenty grams of carbs a day is on the low end of what's typically recommended to maintain nutritional ketosis, although some may be able to eat up to 50 grams a day and still maintain a ketogenic state. The only way you'll know how many total carbs, fiber and net carbs you eat is to keep a food diary. The simplest way of doing this is to use an online nutrition tracker. Also remember you need to measure your ketones to determine if and when you're in nutritional ketosis. One of the primary reasons you develop insulin resistance is because you're eating too many net carbs (total carbs minus fiber), too much protein and too little healthy fat. For optimal health, your body must be able to burn fat for fuel, and this is an ability that is lost when you consume too many net carbs on a daily basis.When your body is able to burn fat for fuel, your liver creates ketones (water-soluble fats) that not only improve your glucose metabolism18 but also burn far more efficiently than carbs, thus lowering inflammation by creating fewer damaging reactive oxygen species and secondary free radicals. If your ketones are above 0.3 mmol/L, as described in the section above, you can start increasing the amount of healthy carbs back into your diet and start cyclical ketosis.To get you started, see my previous article, ""Ketogenic Diet: A Beginner's Ultimate Guide to Keto."" A far more detailed exposition on nutritional ketosis and how to implement a cyclical ketogenic diet can be found in my book, ""Fat for Fuel,"" which is the prequel to ""KetoFast.""Tip No. 5 — Increase Healthy Fats A key to making nutritional ketosis work is to replace the lost carbs with healthy fats, and knowing which fats are healthy and which ones are not is a crucial distinction here. Most people will need 60 to 85 percent of daily calories in the form of fat, but not all fats qualify. Fats to steer clear of are industrially processed vegetable oils, found in most processed foods and restaurant foods. Polyunsaturated fat found in processed vegetable oils is not harmful in and of itself, but becomes so if and when you eat too much of it, and/or when the oils degrade, which occurs during refining, processing and heating (cooking). Not only can they form trans fats if heated high enough, but they can also form cyclic aldehydes, which are even more harmful. For a run-down of the dangers associated with processed vegetable oils, see ""Top 13 Reasons to Replace Dangerous Oils With Healthy Fats."" For cooking, healthy alternatives include coconut oil, grass fed raw organic butter, organic ghee, lard, tallow and olive oil. For general eating, foods high in healthy fats include avocado, olives, coconut, raw nuts such as macadamia and pecans, seeds such as black sesame, cumin, pumpkin and hemp seeds, raw cacao butter and organic pastured egg yolks. Dairy fats found in butter, cheese and yogurt have been shown to lower your diabetes risk specifically. MCT oil is another healthy fat — just be sure to avoid taking it during partial fasting days once you've started KetoFasting, as exogenous ketones will inhibit autophagy. Tip No. 6 — Drink Plenty of Clean Pure Water Next, be sure to drink plenty of clean, purified water. Organic black coffee (meaning no milk or sugar) and tea are other healthy choices. Steer clear of all sweetened beverages, including ""diet"" drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners and fruit juices. As for how much water you need, your best bet is to use thirst and the color of your urine as a guide, along with frequency of urination.Thirst — Simply using thirst as a guide to how much water you need to drink is a simple way to help ensure your individual needs are met, day by dayColor — If your urine is a deep, dark yellow, then you are likely not drinking enough water. Light straw-colored urine is typically a sign of sufficient water intakeFrequency of urination — If your urine is scant or if you haven't urinated in many hours, that too is an indication that you're not drinking enough. Based on the results from a few different studies, a healthy person urinates on average about seven or eight times a day Tip No. 7 — Eat More Nuts and Seeds In addition to being a good source of healthy fats, nuts and seeds are also an excellent source of magnesium, which many are deficient in. Lack of magnesium may raise your risk of insulin resistance as it plays an important role in carbohydrate and glucose metabolism. Magnesium helps your body metabolize carbs and glucose properly. As noted by Today's Dietician:19""Epidemiologic data20,21 suggest that for every 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreases by approximately 15%. The few clinical studies22,23 showing efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity with magnesium supplementation have used doses between 300 and 365 mg/day."" Some of the most magnesium-rich seeds include sunflower, black sesame, black cumin, pumpkin and chia seeds. Among these, black cumin (nigella sativa) deserves special mention, as studies have shown it can help prevent both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In one study, black cumin improved glucose tolerance as efficiently as metformin.24 As a source of healthy fats, my preferences go to macadamias, pecans and walnuts, as they are high in fat while being lower in protein. Tip No. 8 — Properly Prescribed ExerciseLast but not least, you need exercise, focusing more on strength/resistance training than cardio. Research25 published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise found even a single session of moderate exercise can improve the way your body regulates glucose and reduces postprandial glucose spikes, and several studies have demonstrated the benefits of strength training for diabetes specifically.Among them is a 2017 study,26 which found strength training lowered women's risk of Type 2 diabetes by 30%. Adding aerobic exercise on top of it reduced the risk even further. Participants who performed at least 120 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, along with some form of strength training, had a 65% lower risk for Type 2 diabetes than those who did neither.Research27 published in April 2019 found a link between muscular strength and Type 2 diabetes incidence. People with mid-level muscular strength, measured using leg and bench press tests, had a 32% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to weaker cohorts, irrespective of cardiorespiratory fitness. No significant association between diabetes and upper level muscle strength was observed, however. A third example of this kind of research was published in BioMed Research International in 2013.28 This review also investigated the mechanisms of how exercise lowers your risk of diabetes. One way by which strength training improves your glucose metabolism is by increasing glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle.GLUT4 translocation occurs as a result of muscle contraction,29 and is required for proper regulation of glucose uptake in your muscles. Strength training increases your insulin sensitivity, as lean muscle is highly sensitive to insulin,30 which helps restore metabolic flexibility.By using insulin more efficiently, your body also ends up using more glucose, leaving less to circulate in your bloodstream — hence the improvements in glucose control.31,32 ""Increased energy expenditure and excess postexercise oxygen consumption in response to resistance training may be other beneficial effects,"" the review paper33 notes.High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has also been shown to effectively reduce your risk for diabetes. In one such study,34 older overweight Type 2 diabetics improved their glucose regulation in just six HIIT sessions done over the course of two weeks.Participants performed 10 bouts of 60-second cycling at 90 percent of their maximum heart rate, interspersed with 60 seconds of rest (total time spent exercising was one hour per week). Overall, the average 24-hour blood glucose concentration was reduced from 7.6 mmol/L (± 1.0) to 6.6 mmol/L (± 0.7) following the exercise.According to the authors, ""Our findings indicate that low-volume HIIT can rapidly improve glucose control and induce adaptations in skeletal muscle that are linked to improved metabolic health in patients with Type 2 diabetes.""",https://t.co/hdzfjDPDjh,news

If you're new to the concept of intermittent fasting, consider starting by skipping breakfast and have your lunch and dinner within a six-hour timeframe, say 11 AM and 5 PM, making sure you stop eating three hours before going to bed. The latter is important, as it helps protect your mitochondrial function. Recent research8,9 shows men who are at risk of Type 2 diabetes can improve their glucose control, thereby lowering that risk, simply by eating all their meals within a nine-hour timeframe — even if they do not implement any other dietary changes. Research10,11 has also shown men who eat supper at least two hours before bedtime have a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer, and women have a 16% lower risk of breast cancer than those who eat dinner closer to bedtime. For more details on why late-night eating is so detrimental, see ""Eating Early Dinner Aids Weight Loss and Lowers Cancer Risk."" When you do eat, focus on healthy protein in moderate amounts and minimize net carbs like pasta and bread, exchanging them for healthy fats like butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and raw nuts. This will help shift you into fat burning mode. On a related side note, when eating, relax and take your time! Research shows rushed eating, which typically occurs when you're stressed, has a significant impact on your blood sugar level. When you become stressed your body also secretes cortisol and glucagon, both of which affect your blood sugar levels as well.12 You can learn more about this in ""How Stress Can Affect Your Blood Sugar Level.""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Click Here &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; AdvertisementTip No. 2 — Monitor Your Blood Sugar LevelAs mentioned, while prediabetes13 is clinically defined as having a fasting blood sugar level between 100 and 125 mg/dl, I strongly believe any blood sugar over 90 mg/dl puts you in the danger zone for insulin resistance. Your blood sugar is measured through a glucose test, of which there are four types:Fasting plasma glucose test — When you fast overnight and take your blood sample in the morning Oral glucose tolerance test — Similar to the fasting blood sugar test, overnight fasting is required for this, and the person's fasting blood sugar level is measured. Afterward, a sugary liquid is provided and the levels are then tested for the next two hours Hemoglobin A1C test — This test checks the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin and will indicate your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months Random plasma glucose test — This makes use of a blood sample that is taken at a random time You could also do 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring, which I've done in the past, although it's pricey and probably not necessary for most people. At the time, I used a Dexcom monitor, which involves inserting a sensor beneath your skin for a week, which takes continuous glucose readings every few minutes. It really helped me fine-tune and evaluate how different foods impacted my glucose levels, and helped me understand the importance of feast-famine cycling. All of that said, for most people, a simple at-home glucose test,14 where you prick your finger and deposit a drop of blood onto a glucose testing strip, will do the job. Ideally, test yourself two to three times a day: first thing in the morning, before your first meal, and a couple of hours after your last meal.Your blood glucose levels will vary throughout the day. According to conventional recommendations, if you are healthy and do not have diabetes, your fasting blood glucose upon waking should be below 100 mg/dL. I recommend aiming for a fasting (when you wake up) level below 90 mg/dL. Before meal time, your glucose level should read between 70 to 99 mg/dL. After meals — or what's called ""postprandial"" and is usually taken two hours after eating — the level should be below 140 mg/dL.There are two measurements used for blood sugar levels. In the U.S., the measurement is in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). In the U.K. and Canada, the measurement for blood sugar is in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). To convert to mg/dL, multiply the amount by 18. For example, if a person in the U.K. says that their blood glucose result is 7 mmol/L, in the U.S. it's read as 126 mg/dL.Tip No. 3 — Monitor Your Blood KetonesAnother valuable test is the blood ketone test, which will tell you whether you're in nutritional ketosis or not. I recommend starting your intermittent fasting routine and monitoring your blood ketones as you go along. The KetoCoachX monitor15 is currently one of the best and least expensive ketone monitors on the market.You're in nutritional ketosis once your blood ketone level is above 0.3 to 0.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).16 Ideally, perform the test first thing in the morning while still in a fasted state (i.e., before ingesting anything). Having a fasting ketone level above 1 mmol/L is a sign you're in deep ketosis. Once your fasting ketones are greater than 0.3 mmol/L, then you can start incorporating partial fasting as described in my book, ""KetoFast: Rejuvenate Your Health With a Step-by-Step Guide to Timing Your Ketogenic Meals."" The partial fasting regimen described in ""KetoFast"" essentially mimics ancestral eating patterns, allowing your body to work optimally by allowing for periods of breakdown and cleanout, and periods of rebuilding and rejuvenation.Among the many health benefits of cyclical fasting is improved circulating glucose and lipid levels.17 For a summary of my KetoFast protocol, see ""Avoid the Dark Side of Fasting and Ketosis With KetoFasting.""Tip No. 4 — Radically Limit Net Carbs Until You Are Metabolically FlexibleAlong with intermittent fasting, you'll also want to adopt a cyclical ketogenic diet, which involves radically limiting carbs (replacing them with healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein) until you're close to or at your ideal weight. As with intermittent fasting, this will allow your body to start using fat as its primary fuel rather than carbohydrates. Twenty grams of carbs a day is on the low end of what's typically recommended to maintain nutritional ketosis, although some may be able to eat up to 50 grams a day and still maintain a ketogenic state. The only way you'll know how many total carbs, fiber and net carbs you eat is to keep a food diary. The simplest way of doing this is to use an online nutrition tracker. Also remember you need to measure your ketones to determine if and when you're in nutritional ketosis. One of the primary reasons you develop insulin resistance is because you're eating too many net carbs (total carbs minus fiber), too much protein and too little healthy fat. For optimal health, your body must be able to burn fat for fuel, and this is an ability that is lost when you consume too many net carbs on a daily basis.When your body is able to burn fat for fuel, your liver creates ketones (water-soluble fats) that not only improve your glucose metabolism18 but also burn far more efficiently than carbs, thus lowering inflammation by creating fewer damaging reactive oxygen species and secondary free radicals. If your ketones are above 0.3 mmol/L, as described in the section above, you can start increasing the amount of healthy carbs back into your diet and start cyclical ketosis.To get you started, see my previous article, ""Ketogenic Diet: A Beginner's Ultimate Guide to Keto."" A far more detailed exposition on nutritional ketosis and how to implement a cyclical ketogenic diet can be found in my book, ""Fat for Fuel,"" which is the prequel to ""KetoFast.""Tip No. 5 — Increase Healthy Fats A key to making nutritional ketosis work is to replace the lost carbs with healthy fats, and knowing which fats are healthy and which ones are not is a crucial distinction here. Most people will need 60 to 85 percent of daily calories in the form of fat, but not all fats qualify. Fats to steer clear of are industrially processed vegetable oils, found in most processed foods and restaurant foods. Polyunsaturated fat found in processed vegetable oils is not harmful in and of itself, but becomes so if and when you eat too much of it, and/or when the oils degrade, which occurs during refining, processing and heating (cooking). Not only can they form trans fats if heated high enough, but they can also form cyclic aldehydes, which are even more harmful. For a run-down of the dangers associated with processed vegetable oils, see ""Top 13 Reasons to Replace Dangerous Oils With Healthy Fats."" For cooking, healthy alternatives include coconut oil, grass fed raw organic butter, organic ghee, lard, tallow and olive oil. For general eating, foods high in healthy fats include avocado, olives, coconut, raw nuts such as macadamia and pecans, seeds such as black sesame, cumin, pumpkin and hemp seeds, raw cacao butter and organic pastured egg yolks. Dairy fats found in butter, cheese and yogurt have been shown to lower your diabetes risk specifically. MCT oil is another healthy fat — just be sure to avoid taking it during partial fasting days once you've started KetoFasting, as exogenous ketones will inhibit autophagy. Tip No. 6 — Drink Plenty of Clean Pure Water Next, be sure to drink plenty of clean, purified water. Organic black coffee (meaning no milk or sugar) and tea are other healthy choices. Steer clear of all sweetened beverages, including ""diet"" drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners and fruit juices. As for how much water you need, your best bet is to use thirst and the color of your urine as a guide, along with frequency of urination.Thirst — Simply using thirst as a guide to how much water you need to drink is a simple way to help ensure your individual needs are met, day by dayColor — If your urine is a deep, dark yellow, then you are likely not drinking enough water. Light straw-colored urine is typically a sign of sufficient water intakeFrequency of urination — If your urine is scant or if you haven't urinated in many hours, that too is an indication that you're not drinking enough. Based on the results from a few different studies, a healthy person urinates on average about seven or eight times a day Tip No. 7 — Eat More Nuts and Seeds In addition to being a good source of healthy fats, nuts and seeds are also an excellent source of magnesium, which many are deficient in. Lack of magnesium may raise your risk of insulin resistance as it plays an important role in carbohydrate and glucose metabolism. Magnesium helps your body metabolize carbs and glucose properly. As noted by Today's Dietician:19""Epidemiologic data20,21 suggest that for every 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreases by approximately 15%. The few clinical studies22,23 showing efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity with magnesium supplementation have used doses between 300 and 365 mg/day."" Some of the most magnesium-rich seeds include sunflower, black sesame, black cumin, pumpkin and chia seeds. Among these, black cumin (nigella sativa) deserves special mention, as studies have shown it can help prevent both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In one study, black cumin improved glucose tolerance as efficiently as metformin.24 As a source of healthy fats, my preferences go to macadamias, pecans and walnuts, as they are high in fat while being lower in protein. Tip No. 8 — Properly Prescribed ExerciseLast but not least, you need exercise, focusing more on strength/resistance training than cardio. Research25 published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise found even a single session of moderate exercise can improve the way your body regulates glucose and reduces postprandial glucose spikes, and several studies have demonstrated the benefits of strength training for diabetes specifically.Among them is a 2017 study,26 which found strength training lowered women's risk of Type 2 diabetes by 30%. Adding aerobic exercise on top of it reduced the risk even further. Participants who performed at least 120 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, along with some form of strength training, had a 65% lower risk for Type 2 diabetes than those who did neither.Research27 published in April 2019 found a link between muscular strength and Type 2 diabetes incidence. People with mid-level muscular strength, measured using leg and bench press tests, had a 32% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to weaker cohorts, irrespective of cardiorespiratory fitness. No significant association between diabetes and upper level muscle strength was observed, however. A third example of this kind of research was published in BioMed Research International in 2013.28 This review also investigated the mechanisms of how exercise lowers your risk of diabetes. One way by which strength training improves your glucose metabolism is by increasing glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle.GLUT4 translocation occurs as a result of muscle contraction,29 and is required for proper regulation of glucose uptake in your muscles. Strength training increases your insulin sensitivity, as lean muscle is highly sensitive to insulin,30 which helps restore metabolic flexibility.By using insulin more efficiently, your body also ends up using more glucose, leaving less to circulate in your bloodstream — hence the improvements in glucose control.31,32 ""Increased energy expenditure and excess postexercise oxygen consumption in response to resistance training may be other beneficial effects,"" the review paper33 notes.High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has also been shown to effectively reduce your risk for diabetes. In one such study,34 older overweight Type 2 diabetics improved their glucose regulation in just six HIIT sessions done over the course of two weeks.Participants performed 10 bouts of 60-second cycling at 90 percent of their maximum heart rate, interspersed with 60 seconds of rest (total time spent exercising was one hour per week). Overall, the average 24-hour blood glucose concentration was reduced from 7.6 mmol/L (± 1.0) to 6.6 mmol/L (± 0.7) following the exercise.According to the authors, ""Our findings indicate that low-volume HIIT can rapidly improve glucose control and induce adaptations in skeletal muscle that are linked to improved metabolic health in patients with Type 2 diabetes.""",https://t.co/quzo2uCIxa,news
Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,"" Platt, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,"" Colberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""For example, the message 'seek medical help' is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,"" Colberg added. ""Self-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps."" SOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.",https://t.co/VzNhkbN8c8,news

Health Care Providers Now Reveal the Best Habits for Healthy Blood Sugar Levels,"The results have shown that L-Carnitine use led to improvements in insulin sensitivity and an increase in bloodstream's sugar uptake. (Newswire.net -- April 19, 2019) Orlando, FL -- Having healthy blood sugar levels is not just essential for those with diabetes, but for everyone. Diabetes management could be achieved not just by using some medications, but also making some dietary and lifestyle changes.According to experts, it is important to manage stress well and relax. It is recommended to relax the muscles from the toes to the eyes.In a study involving 100 individuals with high levels of blood sugar, it has been found that such a kind of stress relief significantly enhanced their levels. Aside from relaxation, experts further recommend engaging in physical activities.In the United States, a study found that just taking a 1.5 kilometres walk on a daily basis reduces the risk of death due to diabetes by over one third.It is similarly important to remember that walking encourages the cells to be more sensitive to insulin, which promotes better blood sugar control. It further enhances the levels of HDL or good cholesterol.Getting adequate sleep is also recommended, as numerous studies have shown sleep deprivation has negative effects on the levels of blood sugar and insulin.Some natural ingredients have been found beneficial in cases of diabetes, particularly in regulating blood sugar levels.Impressive research findings show that L-Carnitine supplementation has aided in the maintenance of normal blood sugar levels. What makes it even more beneficial is that it could potentially fight insulin resistance.Scientists from Rome carried out a study, which was published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition.The results have shown that L-Carnitine use led to improvements in insulin sensitivity and an increase in bloodstream's sugar uptake.In 2010, a research was conducted as Sapienza University's Department of Clinical Medicine in Rome.The investigators revealed that combination of L-Carnitine and caloric restriction led to a decrease in insulin resistance and increased sensitivity.There are actually many other studies that show how beneficial this amino acid is for diabetes and for a wide range of medicinal purposes. It is widely used via supplementation, which particularly includes a supplement called Divine Bounty L-Carnitine.This extra-strength formula is gaining increasing popularity due to the remarkable healing benefits it offers. It is also protected with a money back guarantee, which is another reason why it is believed widely to be superior over other brands.Divine Bounty L-Carnitine is highly potent and is free from nasty, unwanted ingredients like GMOs, binders, fillers, additives, and preservatives (www.amazon.com/dp/B06XF7K9MM).About Divine BountyDivine Bounty is a family-owned brand that manufactures high-quality turmeric curcumin supplements. Passionate about the potential health benefits of turmeric, the team behind Divine Bounty have carefully researched and sourced only the best ingredients to create the ideal blend of turmeric curcumin.

Scientists Explain How Fenugreek Can Lower Your Blood Sugar,"Fenugreek exists in two variations; the leaves and the seeds that have a bitter taste. It is found in abundance in Mediterranean, South Asia, and North Asia regions. Fenugreek benefits come from both the seeds and the leaves.The leaves are commonly sold as vegetables called methi or as dried leaves while the seeds are either used in powder form as a spice or whole.Several active compounds are found in Fenugreek. These compounds are responsible for giving the plant its many medicinal properties. They include nutrients such as yamogenin, calcium, potassium, iron, magnesium, trigonelline, chlorine, copper, manganese, and zinc.It also contains phytochemical compounds. Moreover, Fenugreek is used in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic. Besides its medicinal benefits, Fenugreek is also a good spice used in many Indian culinary recipes.Blood Sugar and DiabetesEvery time you consume nutrients, your body converts them to glucose. Glucose travels all over your body acting as an energy source for your cells. Hence, ensuring that you have an adequate supply of glucose is vital for the health of your body.On the other hand, insulin is the hormone in your body that is responsible for moving glucose from your blood into your body cells. It is produced by the pancreas.Sometimes the levels of glucose in your body increase. This can occur after a meal or if the glucose levels stay elevated for a period. As a result, your body demands an increase in the amount of insulin that is needed to transport the excess glucose into your cells.This demand puts a strain on your pancreas, and after some time your body might start resisting insulin. This will allow the amount of blood sugar in your body to be massive. Also, the pressure might make it difficult for your body to produce enough insulin to maintain your blood sugar levels.Regardless, both situations raise your risk of Type 2 diabetes. Anyone can have diabetes and at any age. In every year, about one and a half million new Americans are diagnosed with diabetes.Diabetes can severely damage your blood vessels and nerves. However, this disease can be managed and reversed through the use of Fenugreek.How It Affects DiabetesMany studies have been done to determine the anti-diabetic potential of Fenugreek benefits. Some of these studies concluded that the seeds from the plant could improve most of the metabolic symptoms that are associated by both Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.The seeds do this by improving the tolerance of glucose and reducing the levels of blood glucose in the body. One study done by researchers from India discovered that using one hundred grams of non-fat seed powder was beneficial for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes.The benefits include reducing the overall cholesterol, triglycerides, bad cholesterol, and levels of fasting blood glucose. Also, it increases the tolerance to glucose in the body.Another study focused on people that had Type 2 Diabetes. This study discovered that adding fifteen grams of the seed powder to the diet reduced the amount of glucose produced after a meal.A third study was conducted on people that have mild Type 2 Diabetes. In the study, the blood sugar levels were lowered by taking two and a half grams of Fenugreek two times a day for three months.From all these studies, it was agreed that the positive effects were a result of the high content of soluble fiber that is found in the seeds. The fiber is responsible for the three key Fenugreek benefits that help in the management of diabetes. These benefits include the lowering of blood sugar levels, slowing down of digestion, and slowing down the absorption of carbohydrates.1. Lowers Blood Sugar LevelsFenugreek contains an exclusive and unusual amino acid known as the 4HO-Ile. This amino acid is believed to contain anti-diabetic properties. The properties include increasing insulin sensitivity and secretion. Insulin sensitivity helps to reduce the amount of blood sugar in the body.The American Journal of Physiology published research that determined that the amino acid can improve the production of insulin while at the same time reduce the levels of blood sugar. These results were the same both in diabetic and non-diabetic test subjects.The Qom University of Medical Science conducted research that also supports the capacity of 4HO-Ile to treat diabetes. Also, Dr. Shikha Sharma, who is the Founder of the NutriHealth and a Wellness Expert endorses the use of the plant as a medical prescription for diabetes.The seeds also block the alpha-amylase activity as well as the sucrase activity. These two are enzymes responsible for breaking down large sugars and turning them into glucose. The result is an overall lowered concentration of sugar in the blood.2. Lowers CholesterolOne of the Fenugreek benefits is that it reduces the amount of cholesterol that the body produces. Its most significant advantage is that it lowers the bad cholesterol, otherwise known as the low-density lipoprotein.In a study done by the University of Michigan Health System, it was discovered that the seeds contain steroidal saponins that are responsible for slowing down the absorption of the cholesterol in the intestines.These saponins also reduce the rate of production of cholesterol. Additionally, they reduce the number of triglycerides that is absorbed from the fatty acids. On the other hand, they release the good cholesterol in the body.3. Helps DigestionThe fiber and the antioxidants that are present in Fenugreek will help you with your stomach ailments. It works by removing all the harmful toxins from your body. Therefore, it is an excellent treatment option for indigestion and gastritis.The seeds also help to prevent the occurrence of digestive issues that result from stomach ulcers and constipation. The seeds act as natural digestives. They also have lubricating properties that aid in soothing the intestines as well as the stomach.How To Use The Fenugreek Benefits For DiabetesThere are several ways that you can use plant seeds to treat diabetes. Below is a list of the ideas you can incorporate into your daily routine.1. Tea For DiabetesIf you love having tea in the morning, you can try this option that will make you healthier by regulating the amount of blood glucose in your body. All you need is one teaspoon of the dried leaves, one cup of water, one teaspoon of the seeds, and one teaspoon of honey.Start by boiling one cup of water in a saucepan. Add the leaves as well as the seeds and then leave them to seep for ten minutes. Transfer the drink to a cup after straining.Add the honey to remove the bitter taste from the seeds and drink your tea. For better results, have your tea in the morning and the evening.2. Bitter Gourd, Need, and Plum seedThis is a complete powder combination of the four ingredients. You only need one tablespoon of each of the components including the seed powder. Then, mix all the ingredients in one bowl.You can store the mixture in a glass jar in a dry and cool place. Use one teaspoon of the mixture twice every day with water if you can drink the water before you have your lunch and your dinner.3. Tincture For DiabetesFor this treatment, you will need two tablespoons of the dried leaves from the plant and two tablespoons from the seeds. You will also need one cup of water.In aluminum or a steel container, you will place the seeds and the leaves. Add one cup of boiling water into the bowl and leave it to steep for thirty minutes. After straining, you can store the mixture in a glass jar.Consume one half of the teaspoon three times a day for you to get the best health results.4. Seeds and YogurtYogurt already has significant anti-inflammatory properties. Hence, combining the yogurt with the seeds makes an excellent healthy combination.Take one tablespoon of the seeds and one cup of yogurt. The yogurt should be plain. Grind the seeds to make a fine powder for the mixture.Once the powder is ready, add it to the yogurt and mix it properly. You can have this mixture two times a day for best results.5. Seeds With WaterSoaking the seeds in water is the most popular form of treatment that is used for diabetes. All you require for this mixture is two cups of water and two tablespoons of the seeds.To make the treatment, put the seeds in a container and add the plain water. Cover this mixture and leave it overnight. In the morning, strain the mixture and drink before you eat anything else.Take the drink for a month every morning so that you can reduce the amount of glucose in your blood.6. As a SpiceThis is one method of treatment that you can use to avoid the bitter-tasting seeds. This is because the other ingredients in your food will mask the bitter taste. Hence, add the spice to your favorite rice of curry and enjoy the benefits of the plant.Remember, you should add the spice to the food after it is thoroughly cooked. This is because heat reduces the nutritional value of the spice.ConclusionApart from seed powder and dried leaves, you can also consume the nutritional benefits of this plant through supplements. However, ensure that you keep your dose under the recommended amount. The recommended dose is commonly between two and a half grams and fifteen grams of the seeds.The amount will depend on how severe your diabetes is as well as your age and physical statue. You will also experience some side effects such as bloating and gas. Hence, seek the advice of a medical professional.The post Scientists Explain How Fenugreek Can Lower Your Blood Sugar appeared first on Power of Positivity: Positive Thinking &amp; Attitude.[Top 10 Malaysia &amp; Singapore Most Beautiful Girls]Have you follow?",https://t.co/YwyEjVy7zP,news
Type 2 diabetes: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?,"Type 2 diabetes management: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?&amp;nbsp New Delhi: You may have heard that drumstick or Moringa oleifera leaves can help maintain blood sugar levels, making it an effective natural remedy to manage diabetes. The plant, often referred to as the miracle tree, has been used for centuries owing to its health benefits. Studies have shown that moringa oleifera contains beneficial antioxidants and bioactive compounds that can help treat and prevent diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, respiratory and skin problems. The moringa tree, which is native to India, is also known by other names such as horseradish tree or ben oil tree.Type 2 diabetes is a major global public health problem that can lead to serious complications if controlled poorly. The condition raises blood glucose (sugar) levels, also known as hyperglycaemia, which may cause damage to the eye, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels. Keeping blood sugar along with body weight under control through a combination of a healthy lifestyle and standard treatment is an important part of diabetes management. Studies show certain herbs and spices blood sugar-lowering properties, and one such being drumstick leaves. Take a look at how this plant can be useful in controlling diabetes.Can Moringa leaves help treat diabetes?Various studies showed effects of moringa leaves on lowering blood sugar levels in diabetes patients and animals, indicating that the plant can be used as a natural way to combat the disease. One study involving 30 women reported that consuming 7 grams of moringa leaf powder everyday for three months helped reduce fasting blood sugar levels 13.5 per cent, on average.Similarly, another small study found that using moringa leaves - about 50 grams - in a meal reduced the rise in blood sugar by some 21 per cent. However, it may be noted that more work is required before making any solid recommendations.Research showed that plant compounds such as isothiocyanates in moringa can help reduce body weight, improve glucose tolerance and insulin signaling in mice fed very high-fat diet (VHFD) supplemented with 5% moringa concentrate (MC). The results also revealed that these mice did not develop fatty liver disease compared to VHFD-fed mice.It is claimed that moringa can help reduce the amount of sugar in the blood, as well as glucose and protein in the urine, which may help treat diabetes.Benefits and risks of Moringa leavesMoringa oleifera is has been used in traditional herbal medicines for many years. The plant is believed to offer many benefits and its uses range from beauty to preventing and curing diseases - such as asthma, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, digestive issues, etc.Moringa leaves are packed with nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are good for your health. However, consuming it is not recommended for pregnant women as moringa may possess anti-fertility qualities. If you have diabetes and are considering using moringa, we suggest you discuss it with your doctor first.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,"" Platt, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,"" Colberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""For example, the message 'seek medical help' is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,"" Colberg added. ""Self-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps."" SOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.",https://t.co/FFrEuJ0fAC,news
"What is Healthier: Natural Sugar, Table Sugar, Artificial Sweeteners or Sugar Alcohols?","Artificial sweetener: what are the differences?With artificial sweeteners, things get complicated because there are so many different FDA-approved types:SaccharinAlso known as Sweet'N Low, is a little more controversial; saccharin was deemed unsafe after a study in 1978 found a connection between the sweetener and bladder cancer in rats. But subsequent studies have found no clear correlation between saccharin and cancer in humans, since we process it differently than rats do. Go figure. More recent research suggests it could even help inhibit cancer cell growth… wait, what? Even though the National Cancer Institute says it's safe for consumption, the 300-times-sweeter-than-sugar sweetener hasn't been as popular since the whole late-'70s debacle. We'd say this is your WORST choice.AspartameIs the most common ingredient you'll find in sugar-free processed foods, like diet soda. It's also sold in little packets under the brand names Equal and NutraSweet, and is 200 times sweeter than sugar. Unlike other sweeteners, which generally just pass through your body, aspartame is metabolized into compounds found in natural food. It's considered safe in small amounts, except for people with phenylketonuria, a genetic disease. We'd say this is your NEXT WORST choice.SucraloseAlso known as Splenda, passes through the body easily and does not build up in body fat. It's also 600 times sweeter than sugar, so a little goes a long way. A bad choice but so far not as harmful.SteviaIs about 300 times sweeter than sugar, has been touted as the latest, healthiest artificial sweetener because it comes from the Stevia rebaudiana plant. A plant, that must be good! It has zero calories, and Dr. Kumar says it can result in lower glucose and insulin levels after meals than sugar. But overall, the hype could be more marketing than scientific fact; while Rebaudioside A, also known as stevia extract, has been deemed generally recognized as safe by the FDA, pure stevia has not been given the same stamp of approval. Overall, artificial sweeteners are generally all on the same playing field anyway. The best of these four choices.""As far as the long-term health effects of using artificial sweeteners, the FDA has recognized some artificial sweeteners (saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, stevia extract) as 'generally recognized as safe,'"" Dr. Kumar explains. ""Because they generally pass through you without being digested (except aspartame), and because they have been studied extensively in labs, they are accepted as safe for long-term use (other than aspartame in people with phenylketonuria).""",https://t.co/cTG2ZIz5Jt,news
Foods that spike a patient's blood glucose are not what you think,"When providing nutrition advice to patients with prediabetes, the foods that can increase blood glucose levels are often not what you think. Identifying those foods are key to helping patients take the right step toward healthier eating. The AMA Ed Hub™—your center for personalized learning from sources you trust—offers CME on a broad range of topics, including Nutrition Science for Health and Longevity: What Every Physician Needs to Know, to help physicians begin an effective nutrition conversation with patients. The four-hour, self-paced course is developed and hosted by the Gaples Institute for Integrative Cardiology, a nonprofit focused on enhancing the role of nutrition and lifestyle in health care, and is distributed in collaboration with the AMA Ed Hub.Most people know that eating sugar-filled candies can cause blood glucose levels to rise, which for those predisposed, can create a greater risk for prediabetes. However, foods don't have to taste sweet to spike blood sugar levels. ""It's well understood that if you eat something sweet, like a brownie your blood glucose will bump, so no one is surprised when that happens,"" said Stephen Devries, MD, a cardiologist and executive director of the Gaples Institute. ""But many patients are unaware that starchy foods, many without a trace of sweetness, can bump blood glucose levels even more."" Bagel vs. donut Donuts are filled with added sugar and fat-no one mistakes them for a healthy food choice. But sometimes, well-meaning replacement foods can have unintended consequences. ""Patients with reason to be concerned about their blood sugar usually understand that sugary foods like donuts are poor choices,"" said Dr. Devries. ""In an effort to lower their sugar, they may swap a breakfast donut for something less sweet, like a bagel. But many patients don't realize that starchy foods can cause blood sugar to soar even higher than sweet ones."" The explanation is that starch is metabolized by the body into glucose. Because the bagel has a greater mass of carbohydrate than the donut, it leads to a higher release of glucose into the blood stream referred to as the ""glycemic load."" However, the conclusion is definitely not to encourage patients to eat more donuts. Instead, ""the importance of comparing glycemic loads is to demonstrate that patients need to take care to limit not only sugary foods like donuts, but to also reduce their intake of starchy foods that can also spike sugar levels,"" said Dr. Devries. ""Skip the donuts and bagels for breakfast, better to opt for oatmeal and fruit for breakfast,"" he added. Starchy potatoes""Potatoes are a vegetable, but the health value of all vegetables are not interchangeable. White potatoes in particular have a very high glycemic load. As a result, a baked white potato can also raise blood sugar even more than a glazed donut."" Interestingly, potatoes chilled when eaten have a lower glycemic load than when served warm. A good alternative to potatoes as a side dish are beans or cauliflower rice, a popular culinary newcomer. The glycemic load is much lower, and cauliflower includes several key nutrients. Sticky white rice Even though it is not sweet, sticky white rice is another food that can deceptively bump blood sugar. Devoid of the fibrous outer bran and nutrient filled germ layers, white rice is mostly starch with a correspondingly high glycemic load. A better choice is brown rice, a whole grain with more fiber than white rice and a lower glycemic load. Other whole grain alternatives to white rice are barley and farro. ""Whole grains are absolutely preferred over refined, but shouldn't be consumed in unlimited quantities said Dr. Devries. ""Large amounts of even whole grains, including brown rice can still spike blood glucose levels."" Fiber to the rescueAs described in the Gaples Institute nutrition course, dietary fiber, especially the soluble type, reduces the amount of sugar absorbed from the digestive tract. Good sources of dietary soluble fiber include oats, beans, apples, citrus fruits, and nuts. AMA members are eligible for a 20 percent discount on the Gaples Institute's CME modules.

THIS type of bread is easiest to digest and better for blood sugar than most breads,"By: Cat Ebeling &amp; Mike GearyCo-authors of the best-sellers: Â The Fat Burning Kitchen,Â The Top 101 Foods that Fight Aging &amp; The Diabetes Fix3 Reasons THIS Kind of Bread is Healthier to EatBread gets a lot of bashing these days, especially in light of 'low-carb' or Paleo diets. And there is good reason for itâ€""bread (even whole grain bread) contains gluten, and can contribute to inflammation in the body–especially the gut, and even the healthier 'whole grain' versions of bread can increase the blood sugar levels dramatically… In fact, some blood sugar tests have shown that 2 slices of ""whole wheat"" bread can spike blood sugar as high as an equivalent amount of calories of pure table sugar.Gluten free bread can often beÂ just as bad or worse, with its highly refined grains and starches. However, one particular type of bread is far healthier and easier to digest and it's been around for centuries…Sourdough bread is made in an entirely different way than commercially prepared breads and gluten free breads. Sourdough is a fermented bread, and the fermentation processÂ makes it easier to digest and less likely to spike blood sugar levels, while also making the gluten in sourdough bread easier to digest than standard white, wheat, or multigrain breads.Sourdough bread is actually one of the oldest ways of baking bread, and is thought to to have been prepared and baked in ancient Egypt around 1500 BC. Â Sourdough bread is still hugely popular in the Mediterranean and Middle East, as well as the San Francisco area of the United States. Â (Mike's note: Â While on a trip in France last year, we noticed that almost every restaurant served sourdough bread instead of regular non-fermented bread, and with grass-fed butter… once again, the French doÂ it right in terms of quality of food and nutrition)Most breads use baker's yeast to help the dough rise, but traditional sourdough recipes use 'wild yeast' and lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria are the same type of beneficial bacteria found in fermented foods such as yogurt, pickles, kombucha, sauerkraut and kimchi.Sourdough uses a 'starter' made of fermented wild yeast, lactic acid bacteria, flour and water. The sourdough starter begins to ferment the sugars in the dough, changing the molecular structure, and breaking down its components, creating lactic acid and lactobacilli.More Nutrition in Every SlicePhytic acid is a substance in nuts, seeds and grains. Phytic acid or phytates are considered 'anti-nutrients' because they bind with minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc, making them unusable in the body, creating mineral deficiencies in those who eat large quantities of nuts, seeds and grains. This is especially true for vegetarians and vegans. It also binds with niacin, creating a B-vitamin deficiency called pellagra, which is especially noticeable in developing countries.Probiotic lactobacilli contains the enzyme phytase, which breaks down phytic acid, making the sourdough bread easier to digest, and rendering the nutrients and minerals easier to utilize in the body.Â This study shows sourdough bread fermentation reduces the phytate content by 24-50% over conventional yeast bread.Â Studies show that the lactic acid in sourdough can actually release more antioxidants during fermentation. Sourdough fermentation also tends to increase the folate levels in the bread as well.Because of its natural fermentation, sourdough also possesses a variety of bioavailable nutrients. It is rich in B vitamins, B1, B6, B12, folate, thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, vitamin E, selenium, iron, manganese, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and potassium, along with its well balanced proteins and fatty acids. By contrast, many commercially prepared breads are so low in nutrients, that less-than-desirable synthetic vitaminsÂ are added back in, and those are more poorly absorbed by us.Easier to Digest Even if Gluten-IntolerantMany people are gluten sensitive or gluten intolerant. This means they are sensitive to the gluten molecule or protein in most breads. When sourdough bread is fermented, the fermentation process helps to dissolve the proteins and peptide bonds in the gluten. The enzymes in the bread help dissolve albumin, globulin, prolamin, and glutalin. These enzymes also produce a type of alcohol that will dissolve water-insoluble protein bonds. This breaking down of these proteins means that gluten sensitive people are often able to eat sourdough bread without a reaction. While gluten tolerance varies from person to person, those with true celiac disease should still avoid sourdough bread if it's made from wheat or rye. Gluten-free sourdough is an option however, for those who are extremely sensitive to gluten.Keep in mind though, that not all sourdough bread is made the same way, and depending on how long it ferments, and how long it is kneaded, can make the difference between a tummy ache from gluten and no tummy ache.[Cat's note: Â I have genuine celiac disease and am pretty sensitive, but when traveling overseas, I have found I have been able to eat bread from Peru, some parts of Europe and Nepal, so I may have to try this out and see what happens]. Better Blood Sugar ControlOne of the big negatives about eating regular bread, even the 'whole wheat' or 'whole grain' variety, is the blood sugar effects. People are often shocked to hear that whole wheat bread often increases blood sugar to as high of a level, or even higher level than pure sugarÂ does. In fact, eating two slices of whole wheat bread is not too different than eating a candy bar in terms of blood sugar impact!The good news is that sourdough bread may have a better effect on blood sugar and insulin levels than whole wheat bread, though the reason for this is not yet fully understood. Researchers theorize that the fermentation process must alter the carbohydrate molecules, which in turn slows down the speed at which the sugars enter the bloodstream. Several studies compared the glucose response of participants with sourdough bread and regular bread with baker's yeast. Participants showed lower blood sugar and insulin response overall with the sourdough bread.Make Your Own SourdoughMuch of the sourdough you buy in grocery stores in the US is not genuine sourdough and therefore will not contain the nutrient benefits that real sourdough contains. Â However, high quality restaurants and bakeries will often have legitimate genuine sourdough. Â You can also easily make your own sourdough at home, but remember it takes time to produce a high quality sourdough starter.Once you have your starter, you 'feed' it daily and let it grow for 5-7 days. Do not rush this process.Â Here are a few sourdough bread recipes from various websites:Enjoy your sourdough bread with a generous hunk of grass fed butter and raw honey! Now, that's good eatin'!Speaking of bread…Did you know that traditional grain-based bread contains a compound that is the #1 greatest danger in your diet.Studies show that this compound (and I am not talking about ""gluten) is toxic to your heart and blood vessels… toxic to your immune system… and toxic to your nerves and brain.And if that's not enough…This hidden compound also makes it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to burn fat and lose weight!The great news is that you can still have your BREAD… and be well too!Plus, this unique type of bread shown on that page actually HELPS your body burn MORE fat than eating vegetables (it actually triggers a fat-burning hormonal environment in your body)Discover the secret to the world's healthiest bread… a secret that took my good friend Kelley Herring 10 years to master!Here's to enjoying delicious bread again, while simultaneously putting your body in a fat-burning state (win-win!) …This is PERFECT for diabetics too, since this special type of bread has almost ZERO impact on blood sugar.References:",https://t.co/Cdjtz1PtD1,news
Diabetes type 2 diet: Prevent high blood sugar symptoms with muesli breakfast,"Diabetes is a common condition that affects more than four million people in the UK, and 90 per cent of cases are caused by type 2 diabetes. The condition may be caused by the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the body not reacting to insulin. Without enough of the hormone, the body struggles to convert sugar in the blood into useable energy. But you could lower your risk of diabetes symptoms by regularly eating muesli, it's been claimed.Unsweetened muesli is one of the best cereals for diabetes patients, according to medical website Medical News Today.It's a fibre-rich, low-sugar alternative to some more common brands of cereal, it said.But, if you decide to eat muesli for breakfast, it's a good idea to use unsweetened almond milk instead of regular cow's milk.""Sugary cereals, bagels with cream cheese, and fried bacon are all popular breakfast foods, but they are not healthful options and can be poor choices for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.""The best breakfast is one that is high in fibre but low in added sugar, carbohydrates, and salt.""The fibre in cereals may help a person control their blood sugar levels, but many popular brands of cereal are high in sugar and low in fibre, including those that manufacturers advertise as being healthful.""Unsweetened muesli with unsweetened almond milk offers a fibre-rich, low-sugar alternative.""People can use the five-five rule when navigating the cereal aisle, which means aiming for a product that contains at least 5g of fibre and less than 5g of sugar per serving.""Meanwhile you could also lower your risk of high blood sugar by eating eggs for breakfast.People that eat the most eggs are up to 38 per cent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared to those that eat the least, it added.They could also help patients with their weight loss routines. Obesity is, in itself, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.Many people may have diabetes without even knowing it, because the symptoms don't necessarily make you feel unwell.Common diabetes symptoms include having an unquenchable thirst, feeling very tired, and passing more urine than normal.Speak to a doctor if you're worried about the symptoms of diabetes, or if you think you may be at risk.You could lower your risk of the condition by eating a healthy, balanced diet, and by doing regular exercise.Everyone should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week.",https://t.co/SENFGKz2dE,news
"Plant-Based Diet Leads to Weight Loss and Better Regulation of Blood Sugar, Small Study","Plant-based diets high in carbohydrates reduce body weight and body fat and improve insulin function in overweight individuals, according to a small study.The study has important implications because more than 7 in 10 U.S. adults are considered overweight or obese, which is a considerable risk factor for developing diabetes.""Fad diets often lead people to fear carbohydrates,"" says lead study author, Dr. Hana Kahleova, director of clinical research for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. ""But the research continues to show that healthy carbohydrates–from fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains–are the healthiest fuel for our bodies.""Study DesignIn the 16-week randomized clinical trial, researchers assessed insulin resistance after a meal for 75 overweight participants without diabetes for 16 weeks, half of whom followed a low-fat, vegan diet. 72 participants (96%) completed the whole study.The plant-based diet group avoided all animal products and added oils. Their fat intake was limited to 20-30 grams per day. There were no limits on calories or carbohydrate intake.The control group maintained their current diets, which included meat and dairy products.Neither group altered their exercise routines.Total carbohydrate intake did not change in the control group, but increased significantly in the plant-based diet group, both as absolute intake and as a percentage of total calories.Participants focused on whole, complex carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.ResultsAt the end of the trial, body mass index, body weight, fat mass, visceral fat volume, and insulin resistance decreased significantly in the plant-based diet group. There were no significant changes in the control group.Kahleova says the results are statistically significant. ""The higher the carbohydrate intake, the more weight the participants were losing, particularly fat and visceral fat,"" she indicates.As far as what was more important: the carb intake or the lack of animal products in the diet, Kahleova says both factors are important.""When people remove animal products from their diets, they tend to start eating more carbohydrates, as opposed to fat or protein,"" Kahleova explains. ""Complex carbohydrates are rich in fiber, which is only found in plant foods, which helps fill you up without adding any extra calories.""By avoiding animal products, she says we not only consume more fiber, but we also tend to eat more nutrient-dense foods and less fat, saturated fat, and calories.Kahleova says that lower body fat increases beta-cells' ability to regulate blood sugar. She says these results show that a vegan dietary intervention could help prevent diabetes.Researchers say the study's results support other findings that a plant-based, high-carbohydrate diet can help with weight regulation and body composition and reduce the risk for Type 2 diabetes.Complex carbohydrates are naturally rich in fiber–a nutrient found in plant foods that add bulk to the diet without adding extra calories.The study adds to the body of evidence showing that plant-based diets are effective for weight loss.""Previous clinical trials have shown that people who switch to a plant-based diet lose weight, while epidemiological studies, including the Adventist Health Study, have shown that populations eating plant-based diets tend to be slimmer than those consuming animal products,"" she adds.Study authors were from: Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, CNR Institute of Neuroscience in Padua, Italy, the Institute of Endocrinology in Prague, Czech Republic, the School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, and the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC.The study was funded by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine is a nonprofit organization encouraging the use of low-fat, plant-based diets and discouraging the use of animal-derived, fatty, and sugary foods.Findings have been published in the journal, Nutrients.Sources:High-carbohydrates diet leads to weight loss, according to a new study.

Homemade Sourdough Bread: Better for Blood Sugar and Won't Hurt Your Gut Like Gluten,"Nutrition experts often warn us to avoid the daily consumption of bread, and there are several reasons for it:-- Bread has low nutritional value-- Most breads contain Amylopectin-A, one of the main components of starch, and has been found to support the development of insulin resistance and diabetes type 2.-- Bread contains gluten, so it should be eaten in moderation only-- It stimulates the formation of mucus and leads to respiratory system issues-- The consumption of breads causes euphoria and leads to food cravings-- The starches and gluten in bread are difficult for the stomach to digest, which causes digestive issues-- Breads contain phytates that reduce the absorption of many vitamins and minerals.On the other hand, numerous nutritionists recommend sourdough bread as a healthy option to bread.Here are several reasons for you to try it:1. It is overloaded with nutrientsSourdough bread is a rich source of vitamins E, B1-B6, B12, protein, fatty acids, niacin, thiamin, folate, iron, magnesium, potassium, riboflavin, selenium, manganese, calcium, phosphorus, and is free of the toxic preservatives found in commercial breads, as it already contains acetic acid, that prevents the growth of molds.2. It contains wild yeast and good bacteria (Lactobacillus)Sourdough bread contains good bacteria and wild yeast, which predigest the starches and help the digestive process. Moreover, lactobacilli stimulate the production of lactic acid, that inhibits the negative effects of phytates, and thus improves the absorption of nutrients in the body. The lactic acid prevents spikes of blood glucose, while the fermentation process boosts the healthy function of the gut.3. It is safe for gluten-intolerant peopleIt is tolerable to gluten-sensitive people as the fermentation process allows good bacteria to break down the gluten proteins into small amounts. If you are willing to prepare your homemade sourdough bread at home, you need three ingredients only: salt, flour, and water. Follow the guidelines by Healthline:""Make a sourdough starter. Feed your starter daily and let it grow for a few days. You will use part of this starter to make the bread and save the rest for future use.Mix part of your starter with flour and water and allow this mixture to rest for a few hours. Then add salt. Fold the dough a few times before letting it rest again for approximately 10–30 minutes. Repeat the folding and resting steps a few times until the dough becomes smooth and stretchy.On the final rest, let the dough rise at room temperature until it grows to about 1.5 times its original volume. Shape your bread loaf and bake it in a Dutch oven. Allow bread to cool on a rack for 2–3 hours before slicing it.""Enjoy it, but remember, even though it is healthy, sourdough bread is still bread, so consume it in moderation!",https://t.co/aFTfbheeC2,news
"Metformin Trumps Diet, Exercise for Sustained Weight Loss, Study Finds","Doctors' routine recommendations for avoiding type 2 diabetes in the face of a prediabetes diagnosis is to lose weight by following a nutritious diet and exercising — and in some cases taking medication. But a new study, published in April 2019 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, has suggested that the popular blood sugar–lowering drug Glucophage (metformin) alone may help people with prediabetes sustain their weight loss and lower their risk for type 2 diabetes.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Diabetes Prevention Program, losing 5 to 10 percent of your weight in six months can help improve blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol.In the study, among overweight and obese people with prediabetes who achieved 5 percent or more weight loss initially, the percentage who kept the weight off over time was greater among those taking metformin — a medication that helps control high blood sugar and can aid weight loss — than those who made intensive lifestyle changes.""We were surprised by the resilience of the metformin group in not regaining weight they lost in the first year,"" says study author Kishore Gadde, MD, a professor in heart disease prevention at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""While there was individual variability, those assigned to receive metformin collectively performed very well in the long term, especially in the last 10 years of the 15-year follow-up.""Although the weight loss mechanism behind metformin is unclear, the Mayo Clinic notes that the drug seems to reduce hunger, and two of the drug's side effects — diarrhea and upset stomach — could also reduce how much someone eats.The CDC estimates that 100 million American adults have prediabetes or diabetes. The agency estimates that 30.3 million Americans have diabetes, with 90 to 95 percent of those cases type 2. Of the total with diabetes, 7.2 million are undiagnosed. Meanwhile, 4 in 10 American adults have obesity, according to the CDC, and extra weight not only raises the risk of type 2 diabetes but also heart disease and some types of cancer.RELATED: Does Metformin Cause Weight Loss? What to Know Before You Take ItCould Metformin Be a Possible Lasting Solution for Weight Control?Dr. Gadde and his fellow investigators tracked 3,234 people who had obesity or were overweight, and had elevated blood sugar levels. Researchers randomly selected them to receive either metformin, a placebo, or an intensive diet and exercise program.Those in the lifestyle intervention group completed 16 sessions where they learned how to eat healthful foods, reduce their calorie and fat intake, and develop an exercise regimen incorporating 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as walking, per week.During the first year, the lifestyle intervention patients lost the most weight. Nearly 63 percent in this group lost at least 5 percent of their weight in the first year compared with 28.5 percent in the metformin group and 13.4 percent in the placebo group.Yet investigators observed that the highest proportion of those who kept pounds off after 6 to 15 years was in the metformin group. The percentage who maintained more than 5 percent weight loss was 56 percent in the metformin group versus 43 percent in the lifestyle group and 42 percent in the placebo arm.RELATED: Losing This Much Weight May Put Type 2 Diabetes in Remission, Study SuggestsWhy Keeping Lost Weight off for Good Tends to Be So ChallengingKevin M. Pantalone, DO, an endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic in Twinsburg, Ohio, and the director of clinical research of Cleveland Clinic's Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute, suspects that the metformin participants had better long-term outcomes than the lifestyle group because taking daily pills may be easier to continue over time compared with dramatic dietary and exercise changes.""Keeping patients engaged in lifestyle modifications, or other weight loss efforts in general, is challenging in the long term, as enthusiasm wanes, or because the weight loss invariably hits a plateau, and patients can become frustrated and disengage as a result,"" says Dr. Pantalone, who was not involved in the study.He believes that the simultaneous use of medication and lifestyle interventions may produce the best results in the long run.""Addressing weight loss in the short term and the long term would likely best be accomplished by leveraging as many modalities as possible, and addressing as many variables as possible,"" says Pantalone. ""The current follow-up observational report did not include a combined intensive lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin intervention group, so we do not know whether the two interventions are additive or synergistic for either initial weight loss or for the long-term maintenance of weight loss.""RELATED: 6 Foolproof Ways to Lose Weight for Diabetes and Heart HealthWeighing the Limitations of the Analysis on Metformin and Weight LossA corresponding editorial, also published in April 2019 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, recognized additional limitations and factors to consider in evaluating the results. While the percentage who maintained weight loss at year 15 was greater in the metformin takers, the hard numbers were bigger for the lifestyle intervention participants — 373 versus 172 in the metformin group.Furthermore, the number of participants in the ILS and placebo groups who received metformin increased over time, wrote editorial authors Leslie Katzel, MD, PhD, and John Sorkin, MD, PhD, with the Baltimore VA Medical Center Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center and University of Maryland School of Medicine. Also the metformin and placebo groups received some educational training in exercise and dietary advice.Gadde says the study began with participants who were at risk of developing diabetes, so the data cannot be directly applied to treatment of patients with diabetes.""Nevertheless, when taken together with an enormous amount of data gathered from studies of patients with diabetes, our study data is consistent in that one of the benefits of metformin is a small degree of long-term weight loss,"" says Gadde.In future studies, researchers would like to investigate whether metformin can help maintain weight loss that is initially achieved with diet, weight loss drugs, or bariatric surgery. One question they'd address, for example, is whether people lose weight initially with low-calorie diets and then take metformin for maintaining that weight loss for several years.No matter what the approach, maintaining a healthy weight is an ongoing and challenging process.""Obesity is a chronic disease,"" says Pantalone, ""and it must be managed continuously — just as we manage high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol — in order to help patients lose weight and maintain that weight loss moving forward.""RELATED: 21 Tips for Weight Loss That Actually Work",https://t.co/PmFKe5eiDy,news
Managing diabetes mellitus and diet through Ayurveda,"Diabetes Mellitus is the most threatening endemic lifestyle disease, having social, medical and economic consequences globally. According to the International Diabetes Federation; 3.8 million deaths are attributed because of Diabetes and its secondary impact. At least 50% of patients are unaware of their condition because of lack of awareness.It also emphasizes that up to 80% of Type 2 diabetes is preventable by adopting a healthy diet and increasing physical activity. Active participation in the form of lifestyle changes of diabetes mellitus and diet is critical. Additionally, it results in fewer expenses in the management of diabetes and ensures good glycemic control.All polyuria diseases in Ayurveda are described under 'Prameha,' and 'Madhumeha' is one amongst them. It is an acquired the form of Prameha due to 'Apathya Ahara' (incompatible diet/unwholesome diet) and 'Apathya vihara' (incompatible lifestyle). Madhumeha is more equated with Type 2 diabetes.Pathya Sevana for diabetes mellitus and diet:'Pathya' means that which is suitable for 'Pathas' or srothas, i.e., the channels and duct systems of the body responsible for transportation of nutrition and other essentials in the body. Moreover, it also cleanses unnecessary and unwanted things from the body. Many foods and lifestyle that are unwholesome and nonbeneficial or harmful for the Pathas or Srothas or channels are 'Apathya.' Keeping away from Apthya and following Pathya is the best way of avoiding disease. In case, the disease has manifested or is in its initial stage, with feeble signs and symptoms, then following Pathya will help in recovering from ailments.In these conditions Pathya itself acts as Chikitsa (medicine) and becomes mandatory co-prescription in the main line of treatment or medication If the individual does not follow the regimen for diabetes mellitus and diet, it becomes difficult to regain health.Ayurvedic Diet protocol for Diabetes mellitus and diet:First and foremost guideline is to avoid diet-related etiological factors (Nidhanaparivarjana).Sthula madhumehi (obese and diabetic) should take Apatarpanaguna and heavy to digest foodsKrisha madhumehi (thin and diabetic) should take Santharpanaguna and light to digest food.Nutritious diet and activities suited to all dhatus (tissues).Quantity and quality of food are decided based on Agni bala(digestive power).Diabetes Mellitus meal plan:A diabetic meal plan for diabetes mellitus matches calories from food to individual physical activity and insulin levels. A balanced diet includes a variety of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, cereals and spices with less processed food. It would help maintain the glycemic level and BMI within limits and reduces the risk of secondary degenerative illness.List of grains, greens, and fruits for you:Fiber-rich green veggies and cereals.Whole green gram, Bengal gram, horse gram, and toor dal.Yava (barley), Wheat, shali (rice).Bitter and astringent veggies – pointed gourd, bitter gourd, cauliflower, green beans, lettuce, drumstick, raw banana, garlic.Jamun, grapes, apple, banana, guava, pomegranate, Indian gooseberry.If you want to know more about your body type and its appropriate Pathya for diabetes mellitus, then chat with our LiveRight Doctors for a personalized solution.",https://t.co/VdrOSsbYuJ,news
Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) – Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management – if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time – about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then.

Type 2 diabetes: Drinking this type of tea may help to prevent blood sugar rises,"Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications with the heart, eyes, nerves, kidneys and feet if not controlled properly. Medication is often used to keep the condition under control, but it's also important to follow a healthy diet that is low in sugar, calories and fat. As well as cutting down on unhealthy foods, you may be able to keep type 2 diabetes under control by consuming foods which can help to improve insulin sensitivity and therefore blood sugar levels. According to Diabetes.co.uk, tea is one drink which may be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes.The diabetes expert notes research has shown tea may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the first place.This is because certain types of tea contain micronutrients called polyphenols, which may increase insulin activity.Polyphenols are packed with antioxidants which can help protect against inflammation and carcinogens - properties which can help prevent type 2 diabetes.However, Diabetes.co.uk notes one study of the popular drink found adding milk decreased the insulin-sensitising effects.The best type of tea to help improve insulin activity is therefore tea without milk, such as black tea, green tea and oolong tea.According to the diabetes expert, a 2009 study showed drinking three cups of tea per day could reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 40 per cent.""Tea is one of the nation's favourite drinks and research suggests it's also a healthy drink,"" said Diabetes.co.uk.""Tea brings a number of health benefits including improving insulin sensitivity.""""However, research notes that some the benefits are best experienced if you drink your tea without milk.""Improving insulin sensitivity is important for people with type 2 diabetes as they either don't produce enough of it or the insulin they do produce is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to control the level of sugar in the blood and transfer it to the cells to be turned into energy.If it is unable to do this, too much sugar will remain in the blood, which is how people develop type 2 diabetes.People with type 2 diabetes are also advised to eat more fruit and vegetables in order to maintain a healthy diet and keep the condition under control.Experts advise that even though fruit contains natural sugars, this is outweighed by the health benefits provided by the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients it has.It's important to cut down on foods high in calories and fat, as these can lead to weight gain, which can increase the risk of diabetes-associated complications.People who are overweight are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in the first place.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.",https://t.co/tM2q3ydOYL,news

Approximately 77 percent of adults with T1D wish they had a medication to help them stay within the recommended blood sugar range for longer periods of time. Endocrinologists are not immune to the effects these challenges have on their patients as 93 percent wish there was more they could do for them.""These findings highlight the ongoing need to provide support to adults living with type 1 diabetes,"" said Rachele Berria, MD, PhD, head of US Diabetes Medical Affairs at Sanofi. ""We have collaborated with AACE and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals to ensure these unmet needs are brought to the forefront in the hopes that increased awareness will help to transform care for people living with type 1 diabetes.""Opportunities Exist to Improve Education and Cross-Share KnowledgeAlmost all endocrinologists (97%) said they keep their patients informed of advances in T1D and, overall, adults with T1D and physicians were aligned in many aspects of their views of T1D. However, opportunities exist to further align as evident by some of the biggest gaps in knowledge including:Virtually all endocrinologists (99%) are knowledgeable about non-insulin pathways, yet less than half (45%) of those with T1D knew about them.Regarding other advances, one third of endocrinologists (32%) believe ""artificial pancreases"" have the greatest potential for positive impact on their patients with T1D but many adults living with T1D (28%) don't know anything about that advancement.""These findings represent an opportunity to enhance education and cross-share information about innovation that might ultimately improve type 1 diabetes care and outcomes,"" said Pablo Lapuerta, MD, executive vice president and chief medical officer at Lexicon. ""Lexicon and our partners at Sanofi are committed to bettering the lives of the millions of people around the world living with diabetes. We understand that living with type 1 diabetes is an everyday challenge and through our collaboration with AACE, we hope to call attention to the unresolved needs of the type 1 diabetes community, specifically.""For more information on the challenges faced by people living with T1D, please visit gobeyondinsulinalonet1d.com.About the SurveysThe research was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in collaboration with Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sanofi, among patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and endocrinologists who treat T1D patients within the United States. The patient survey was conducted May 21 through June 6, 2018 among 255 adults age 18+ who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with T1D. Figures for age by gender, income, race/ethnicity, region, size of household, marital status and employment status were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. The healthcare professional survey was conducted May 22 through June 11, 2018 among 253 endocrinologists who see at least one patient with T1D in a month.

Tips to Optimize Your Blood Sugar Level,"Insulin is essential to staying alive; unfortunately, the vast majority of people have resistance to this essential hormone, speeding up the aging process and contributing to the development of degenerative diseases. Any meal high in grain and sugar carbs typically generates a rapid rise in blood glucose. To compensate, your pancreas secretes more insulin into your bloodstream to lower your blood sugar. Insulin, however, is also very efficient at lowering blood sugar by turning it into fat. The more you secrete, the more fat your body will accumulate. If you consistently consume a high-sugar, high-grain diet, your blood glucose level will be correspondingly high and over time your body becomes desensitized to insulin, requiring more and more of it to get the job done. Eventually, you become insulin resistant and prone to weight gain, and then full-blown diabetic.Prediabetes1 is defined as an elevation in fasting blood glucose between 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and 125 mg/dl. At 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, it formally becomes Type 2 diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 84.1 million American adults — about 1 in 3 — are prediabetic,2,3 and most are unaware of this fact.However, any fasting blood sugar regularly over 90 in my book suggests insulin resistance, and findings by the late Dr. Joseph Kraft — former chairman of the department of clinical pathology and nuclear medicine at Presence Saint Joseph's Hospital, Chicago, and author of ""Diabetes Epidemic and You: Should Everyone Be Tested?"" — suggests a whopping 80% of Americans are insulin resistant, and that's true even if your fasting glucose is normal.4,5The good news is that insulin resistance is one of the easiest health problems to correct. Below I review eight of my top tips for optimizing and maintaining a healthy blood sugar level.Tip No. 1 — Proper Meal TimingIntermittent fasting or compression of your eating window is a powerful approach that facilitates weight loss and helps reduce your risk of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes. In his book ""Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy and Sleep Well Every Night,"" Satchidananda Panda, Ph.D., cites research showing that 90 percent of people eat across a span of 12 hours a day, and many across even longer timespans, which is a clear prescription for metabolic disaster. Intermittent fasting, i.e., the cycling of feast (feeding) and famine (fasting) mimics the eating habits of our ancestors and restores your body to a more natural state that allows a whole host of metabolic benefits to occur.6With regard to insulin resistance, research shows intermittent fasting promotes insulin sensitivity and improves blood sugar management by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates.7While there are a number of different intermittent fasting protocols, my preference is fasting daily for 18 hours and eating all meals within a six-hour window. If you're new to the concept of intermittent fasting, consider starting by skipping breakfast and have your lunch and dinner within a six-hour timeframe, say 11 AM and 5 PM, making sure you stop eating three hours before going to bed. The latter is important, as it helps protect your mitochondrial function. Recent research8,9 shows men who are at risk of Type 2 diabetes can improve their glucose control, thereby lowering that risk, simply by eating all their meals within a nine-hour timeframe — even if they do not implement any other dietary changes. Research10,11 has also shown men who eat supper at least two hours before bedtime have a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer, and women have a 16% lower risk of breast cancer than those who eat dinner closer to bedtime. For more details on why late-night eating is so detrimental, see ""Eating Early Dinner Aids Weight Loss and Lowers Cancer Risk."" When you do eat, focus on healthy protein in moderate amounts and minimize net carbs like pasta and bread, exchanging them for healthy fats like butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and raw nuts. This will help shift you into fat burning mode. On a related side note, when eating, relax and take your time! Research shows rushed eating, which typically occurs when you're stressed, has a significant impact on your blood sugar level. When you become stressed your body also secretes cortisol and glucagon, both of which affect your blood sugar levels as well.12 You can learn more about this in ""How Stress Can Affect Your Blood Sugar Level.""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Click Here &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; AdvertisementTip No. 2 — Monitor Your Blood Sugar LevelAs mentioned, while prediabetes13 is clinically defined as having a fasting blood sugar level between 100 and 125 mg/dl, I strongly believe any blood sugar over 90 mg/dl puts you in the danger zone for insulin resistance. Your blood sugar is measured through a glucose test, of which there are four types:Fasting plasma glucose test — When you fast overnight and take your blood sample in the morning Oral glucose tolerance test — Similar to the fasting blood sugar test, overnight fasting is required for this, and the person's fasting blood sugar level is measured. Afterward, a sugary liquid is provided and the levels are then tested for the next two hours Hemoglobin A1C test — This test checks the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin and will indicate your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months Random plasma glucose test — This makes use of a blood sample that is taken at a random time You could also do 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring, which I've done in the past, although it's pricey and probably not necessary for most people. At the time, I used a Dexcom monitor, which involves inserting a sensor beneath your skin for a week, which takes continuous glucose readings every few minutes. It really helped me fine-tune and evaluate how different foods impacted my glucose levels, and helped me understand the importance of feast-famine cycling. All of that said, for most people, a simple at-home glucose test,14 where you prick your finger and deposit a drop of blood onto a glucose testing strip, will do the job. Ideally, test yourself two to three times a day: first thing in the morning, before your first meal, and a couple of hours after your last meal.Your blood glucose levels will vary throughout the day. According to conventional recommendations, if you are healthy and do not have diabetes, your fasting blood glucose upon waking should be below 100 mg/dL. I recommend aiming for a fasting (when you wake up) level below 90 mg/dL. Before meal time, your glucose level should read between 70 to 99 mg/dL. After meals — or what's called ""postprandial"" and is usually taken two hours after eating — the level should be below 140 mg/dL.There are two measurements used for blood sugar levels. In the U.S., the measurement is in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). In the U.K. and Canada, the measurement for blood sugar is in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). To convert to mg/dL, multiply the amount by 18. For example, if a person in the U.K. says that their blood glucose result is 7 mmol/L, in the U.S. it's read as 126 mg/dL.Tip No. 3 — Monitor Your Blood KetonesAnother valuable test is the blood ketone test, which will tell you whether you're in nutritional ketosis or not. I recommend starting your intermittent fasting routine and monitoring your blood ketones as you go along. The KetoCoachX monitor15 is currently one of the best and least expensive ketone monitors on the market.You're in nutritional ketosis once your blood ketone level is above 0.3 to 0.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).16 Ideally, perform the test first thing in the morning while still in a fasted state (i.e., before ingesting anything). Having a fasting ketone level above 1 mmol/L is a sign you're in deep ketosis. Once your fasting ketones are greater than 0.3 mmol/L, then you can start incorporating partial fasting as described in my book, ""KetoFast: Rejuvenate Your Health With a Step-by-Step Guide to Timing Your Ketogenic Meals."" The partial fasting regimen described in ""KetoFast"" essentially mimics ancestral eating patterns, allowing your body to work optimally by allowing for periods of breakdown and cleanout, and periods of rebuilding and rejuvenation.Among the many health benefits of cyclical fasting is improved circulating glucose and lipid levels.17 For a summary of my KetoFast protocol, see ""Avoid the Dark Side of Fasting and Ketosis With KetoFasting.""Tip No. 4 — Radically Limit Net Carbs Until You Are Metabolically FlexibleAlong with intermittent fasting, you'll also want to adopt a cyclical ketogenic diet, which involves radically limiting carbs (replacing them with healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein) until you're close to or at your ideal weight. As with intermittent fasting, this will allow your body to start using fat as its primary fuel rather than carbohydrates. Twenty grams of carbs a day is on the low end of what's typically recommended to maintain nutritional ketosis, although some may be able to eat up to 50 grams a day and still maintain a ketogenic state. The only way you'll know how many total carbs, fiber and net carbs you eat is to keep a food diary. The simplest way of doing this is to use an online nutrition tracker. Also remember you need to measure your ketones to determine if and when you're in nutritional ketosis. One of the primary reasons you develop insulin resistance is because you're eating too many net carbs (total carbs minus fiber), too much protein and too little healthy fat. For optimal health, your body must be able to burn fat for fuel, and this is an ability that is lost when you consume too many net carbs on a daily basis.When your body is able to burn fat for fuel, your liver creates ketones (water-soluble fats) that not only improve your glucose metabolism18 but also burn far more efficiently than carbs, thus lowering inflammation by creating fewer damaging reactive oxygen species and secondary free radicals. If your ketones are above 0.3 mmol/L, as described in the section above, you can start increasing the amount of healthy carbs back into your diet and start cyclical ketosis.To get you started, see my previous article, ""Ketogenic Diet: A Beginner's Ultimate Guide to Keto."" A far more detailed exposition on nutritional ketosis and how to implement a cyclical ketogenic diet can be found in my book, ""Fat for Fuel,"" which is the prequel to ""KetoFast.""Tip No. 5 — Increase Healthy Fats A key to making nutritional ketosis work is to replace the lost carbs with healthy fats, and knowing which fats are healthy and which ones are not is a crucial distinction here. Most people will need 60 to 85 percent of daily calories in the form of fat, but not all fats qualify. Fats to steer clear of are industrially processed vegetable oils, found in most processed foods and restaurant foods. Polyunsaturated fat found in processed vegetable oils is not harmful in and of itself, but becomes so if and when you eat too much of it, and/or when the oils degrade, which occurs during refining, processing and heating (cooking). Not only can they form trans fats if heated high enough, but they can also form cyclic aldehydes, which are even more harmful. For a run-down of the dangers associated with processed vegetable oils, see ""Top 13 Reasons to Replace Dangerous Oils With Healthy Fats."" For cooking, healthy alternatives include coconut oil, grass fed raw organic butter, organic ghee, lard, tallow and olive oil. For general eating, foods high in healthy fats include avocado, olives, coconut, raw nuts such as macadamia and pecans, seeds such as black sesame, cumin, pumpkin and hemp seeds, raw cacao butter and organic pastured egg yolks. Dairy fats found in butter, cheese and yogurt have been shown to lower your diabetes risk specifically. MCT oil is another healthy fat — just be sure to avoid taking it during partial fasting days once you've started KetoFasting, as exogenous ketones will inhibit autophagy. Tip No. 6 — Drink Plenty of Clean Pure Water Next, be sure to drink plenty of clean, purified water. Organic black coffee (meaning no milk or sugar) and tea are other healthy choices. Steer clear of all sweetened beverages, including ""diet"" drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners and fruit juices. As for how much water you need, your best bet is to use thirst and the color of your urine as a guide, along with frequency of urination.Thirst — Simply using thirst as a guide to how much water you need to drink is a simple way to help ensure your individual needs are met, day by dayColor — If your urine is a deep, dark yellow, then you are likely not drinking enough water. Light straw-colored urine is typically a sign of sufficient water intakeFrequency of urination — If your urine is scant or if you haven't urinated in many hours, that too is an indication that you're not drinking enough. Based on the results from a few different studies, a healthy person urinates on average about seven or eight times a day Tip No. 7 — Eat More Nuts and Seeds In addition to being a good source of healthy fats, nuts and seeds are also an excellent source of magnesium, which many are deficient in. Lack of magnesium may raise your risk of insulin resistance as it plays an important role in carbohydrate and glucose metabolism. Magnesium helps your body metabolize carbs and glucose properly. As noted by Today's Dietician:19""Epidemiologic data20,21 suggest that for every 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreases by approximately 15%. The few clinical studies22,23 showing efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity with magnesium supplementation have used doses between 300 and 365 mg/day."" Some of the most magnesium-rich seeds include sunflower, black sesame, black cumin, pumpkin and chia seeds. Among these, black cumin (nigella sativa) deserves special mention, as studies have shown it can help prevent both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In one study, black cumin improved glucose tolerance as efficiently as metformin.24 As a source of healthy fats, my preferences go to macadamias, pecans and walnuts, as they are high in fat while being lower in protein. Tip No. 8 — Properly Prescribed ExerciseLast but not least, you need exercise, focusing more on strength/resistance training than cardio. Research25 published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise found even a single session of moderate exercise can improve the way your body regulates glucose and reduces postprandial glucose spikes, and several studies have demonstrated the benefits of strength training for diabetes specifically.Among them is a 2017 study,26 which found strength training lowered women's risk of Type 2 diabetes by 30%. Adding aerobic exercise on top of it reduced the risk even further. Participants who performed at least 120 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, along with some form of strength training, had a 65% lower risk for Type 2 diabetes than those who did neither.Research27 published in April 2019 found a link between muscular strength and Type 2 diabetes incidence. People with mid-level muscular strength, measured using leg and bench press tests, had a 32% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to weaker cohorts, irrespective of cardiorespiratory fitness. No significant association between diabetes and upper level muscle strength was observed, however. A third example of this kind of research was published in BioMed Research International in 2013.28 This review also investigated the mechanisms of how exercise lowers your risk of diabetes. One way by which strength training improves your glucose metabolism is by increasing glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle.GLUT4 translocation occurs as a result of muscle contraction,29 and is required for proper regulation of glucose uptake in your muscles. Strength training increases your insulin sensitivity, as lean muscle is highly sensitive to insulin,30 which helps restore metabolic flexibility.By using insulin more efficiently, your body also ends up using more glucose, leaving less to circulate in your bloodstream — hence the improvements in glucose control.31,32 ""Increased energy expenditure and excess postexercise oxygen consumption in response to resistance training may be other beneficial effects,"" the review paper33 notes.High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has also been shown to effectively reduce your risk for diabetes. In one such study,34 older overweight Type 2 diabetics improved their glucose regulation in just six HIIT sessions done over the course of two weeks.Participants performed 10 bouts of 60-second cycling at 90 percent of their maximum heart rate, interspersed with 60 seconds of rest (total time spent exercising was one hour per week). Overall, the average 24-hour blood glucose concentration was reduced from 7.6 mmol/L (± 1.0) to 6.6 mmol/L (± 0.7) following the exercise.According to the authors, ""Our findings indicate that low-volume HIIT can rapidly improve glucose control and induce adaptations in skeletal muscle that are linked to improved metabolic health in patients with Type 2 diabetes.""",https://t.co/u0f4Eenter,news
Flourless Sugar-Free Nut Butter and Jam Thumbprint Cookies,"You're probably already familiar with peanut butter and jam thumbprint cookies (especially if you have kids!). And I'm sure there are some low-carb versions of them out there. But this recipe takes the classic treat a step further by using a nut butter—like almond butter—to make delicious cookies that won't spike your blood sugar. As usual, these are sugar-free, and using nut butter ensures that the carb count is drastically lower than it would be if you were using peanut butter.Read on to find out more!Tips for making the Flourless Sugar-Free Nut Butter and Jam Thumbprint CookiesThis is an extremely easy one-bowl recipe so basically nothing can go wrong. I think the most important thing is to keep your eye on the cookies while they're in the oven so you don't overbake them. In my oven, 15 minutes turns out a perfect result. However, it's old and a bit broken as it doesn't seal properly, so do adjust the baking time according to your oven.As for the jam, feel free to choose any sugar-free jam you like. Homemade is best: you know exactly what's in there. There are lots of sugar-free jams on the market, but unfortunately many of them are not sugar-free in reality. Some are sweetened with fruit juices, which means that the carb count is exactly the same (or even higher!) as in sugar- or syrup-sweetened jams.Another negative is that those sugar-free jams are often sweetened with artificial sweeteners or other ugly stuff, and may contain food additives, too. Essentially, most store-bought sugar-free jams are so full of nasties that I really don't recommend them to anyone.That's why a sugar-free, food-additive-free homemade jam is your best bet. It's surprisingly quick and easy to make, too! Just look at these recipes for wonderful sugar-free strawberry jam (which you'll also find in my Low Sugar, So Simple book), raspberry jam, blueberry jam and this fascinating mock cloudberry jam. Whatever jam you use, make sure the jam is thick enough so that it doesn't get absorbed into the cookie. (Did you know that when making jam, you'll achieve a thicker consistency just by cooking it for longer? You don't necessarily need any added thickeners.)Other than that, there is nothing complicated in this recipe. So, let's take a look at how to make these fantastic Flourless Sugar-Free Nut Butter and Jam Thumbprint Cookies:Have all your ingredients and a small bowl ready. I use homemade almond butter here.Add the almond butter to the bowl.Add the Sukrin Gold (I found it to be the best sweetener for these cookies)……one egg……and a pinch of salt.With clean hands (or with gloves like I have here), start kneading the mixture……until a smooth dough forms.You know the dough is ready when you can form a neat ball from it and the dough doesn't stick to your hands.Next, take a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and start rolling the dough into walnut-sized balls.Place the balls on the parchment-lined baking sheet. The dough yields 16 balls.When all the balls are lying nicely on the baking sheet, lightly press the center of each ball with your thumb to create a small well.Next, take the sugar-free jam and place approximately 1/2 teaspoon in the well of each cookie……like this.At this point, your oven should be hot (350 °F = 175 °C). Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until the cookies have got some color. Don't overbake! And don't underbake either. Just keep an eye on the cookies so that you know when they're done. They shouldn't be too brown.Remove the cookies from the oven.And now, the most important thing: don't touch the cookies when they are hot! Not only will you burn your fingers (you knew that already…!) but you will also break the cookies, as they are very fragile when hot. So now you have to try to hold your horses and let the cookies cool completely.And when they have cooled completely, remove them from the baking sheet and store in a cool, dry place. (Hint: the fridge is not a dry place.)Enjoy!My nut butter cookie experimentsI often make peanut butter cookies just because peanut butter is so affordable and easily available. However, PB is not very low in carbs. Therefore, I'm lucky to have a high-speed blender with which I can prepare my own nut butters and almond butters.I've noticed I always have to add some oil to keep the machine running when I make nut butter. Without oil, the nuts just don't get mixed. I used to add melted coconut oil, but I soon found out that light olive oil performs best. Not that there is anything wrong with coconut oil — just the opposite, as it has many health benefits — but it solidifies in the fridge and makes your nut butter really stiff. When you use light olive oil, it retains the perfect consistency, both at room temperature and in the fridge.So, as I often do, I took out my notes and checked my to-do list. For a long time I'd wanted to try low-carb thumbprint cookies made with peanut butter. I thought now might be a good time to finally try them out.Of course, I wanted to keep the recipe simple: maybe just PB, sweetener and egg to bind the dough. I also had some sugar-free jam which I was planning to use in the cookies.I was wondering if sweetener alone would provide enough flavor or if I should add a little vanilla extract. The jam should be enough on its own, I thought. Then I remembered Sukrin Gold, a marvelous brown sugar substitute and one of my all-time favorite sweeteners.It's of really high quality and it's erythritol-based, which means it contains no artificial sweeteners. It also looks like real brown sugar. Even when you pour it, it behaves like real brown sugar; it moves slowly and the small particles almost stick to each other. Make sense? Well, it's difficult to explain so you should try it yourself and see!So, Sukrin Gold would be the ultimate sweetener for my cookie experiments. It has a slight caramel note and maybe a hint of vanilla as well, so there'd be no need for additional flavorings. However, as the result would most likely be really sweet, I wanted to round out the flavors with a pinch of unrefined sea salt.I was ready to conduct my first experiment. I followed my gut feeling and took 1 cup (240 ml) all-natural peanut butter, 1/3 cup (80 ml) Sukrin Gold, 1 egg and a pinch of salt. I combined everything in a small bowl and started kneading, excited to see whether I'd get a proper dough.It worked! After a half a minute, the mixture started turning into a stiff dough. It didn't stick to my fingers anymore and it was easy to mold. I started shaping the dough into balls, which I placed on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.Once I had used up all the dough, I pressed the center of each ball with my thumb to create a small well. To these wells, I added some sugar-free jam. I had reserved 1/3 cup (80 ml) jam, but didn't even use half of it.I baked the cookies at 350 °F (175 °C). I removed them from the oven after 10 minutes, only to discover that they were still too raw. 15 minutes would have most probably been better.Carefully, I took one hot cookie from the sheet. As soon as I touched it, it broke into small crumbles. Of course! Cookies made with erythritol are very fragile when they're straight out of the oven; however, they hold well together after they cool down. I was hoping this would happen now as well so that I wouldn't end up just with a huge amount of jammy crumble (though I actually found that idea fascinating: jammy crumble would an amazing topping for, say, yogurt!).I was lucky. The cookies did harden, and they held well together after they had cooled down. They also tasted amazing, except there was far too much sweetener. I had used 1/3 cup (80 ml), so I definitely had to reduce the amount to 1/4 cup (60 ml). Other than that, I was very happy with the cookie experiment!Then I got the idea to try out other nut butters to see if they'd work, too. I was aiming for a lower carb count as well. For those cookie experiments, I made almond butter and cashew butter with my blender. True, cashew butter is not very low in carbs, but it has a nicely neutral taste and I wanted to see how that would work in cookies. And if you eat stick to just one cookie, you can easily minimize the carb count. (Overeating doesn't do you any good anyway, so why overindulge!?)So my next cookie experiment featured almond butter. When making the almond butter, I had to use quite a bit of olive oil to get the blender to run, so the dough was oozing oil. I was a bit scared of how the cookies would turn out. Would they be too greasy? Would they hold together at all.Thankfully the cookies turned out really well. They were pleasingly crunchy outside and soft inside. And the jam was just the icing on the cake (almost literally!). In the progress photos, you'll see me using almond butter for the cookies.I made another cookie experiment with homemade cashew butter. To be honest, I didn't feel there was too much difference between cookies made with almond butter and cookies made with cashew butter. They were pretty similar — and equally good. In the video, I use cashew butter for the cookies.After my experiment we had (and still have!) several batches of cookies, as I had made lots of nut butters for my various experiments. That's okay; too many cookies is never a bad thing!Finally, here is the recipe: Flourless Sugar-Free Nut Butter and Jam Thumbprint CookiesPreheat the oven to 350 °F (175 °C).Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Combine the nut, seed or almond butter, Sukrin Gold, egg, and the salt in a medium bowl. Knead with clean hands until a smooth dough forms, about 1 minute.Shape the dough into 16 balls. Place the balls on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper.Press the center of each ball lightly with your thumb to create a small well.Add 1/2 teaspoon jam to the well of each cookie.Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until the cookies have got some color. Don't overbake!Let cool down completely (important!), then remove from the baking sheet.

Hazelnut butter, macadamia butter, and Sunbutter (sunflower seed butter) are great options. Sunbutter gives almost an identical taste to PB, so if you are allergic to peanuts, you can use Sunbutter instead.Feel free to use your preferred sugar-free jam. Jams made with berries go well, but if you find, for example, sugar-free apricot jam, go for it; it's a great match, too.I really recommend Sukrin Gold for the sweetener because of its superior taste and qualities. However, if you can't find it, you can use regular erythritol crystals instead.

While carbs are an essential nutrient found in foods, knowing what and how much to eat is an important part of managing diabetes. A diabetes diet is simply a healthy eating plan that will help you control both weight and blood sugar, as well as prevent common complications the disease can cause.Essentially, a diabetes meal should be nutritionally balanced, consisting of a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in fibre, protein, and antioxidants that reduce disease and improve health. Apart from carbohydrates (complex carbs), your diabetes diet should also include healthy fats from nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish. Fats are a necessary part of a balanced diet, so make sure that you incorporate all these nutrients to balance your meal. Below are a few tips to help you develop a healthy eating plan that will help you manage blood sugar levels, lose weight, and control heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol.Type 2 diabetes: Some guidelines for creating a healthy meal planThe good is that for most people with type 2 diabetes, making healthier food choices to control blood sugar will make weight loss easier, while also offering a host of benefits. Below are a few tips to help you develop a diabetes-friendly meal your whole family can enjoy.Have regular meals, paying special attention to serving size and carb content.

Diabetes type 2 exercise: Prevent high blood sugar symptoms with water aerobics sport,"Diabetes is a common condition that affects more than four million people in the UK, and 90 per cent of all cases are caused by type 2 diabetes. The condition could be caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or the body not reacting to insulin. You could lower your risk of diabetes symptoms by regularly doing exercise. One of the best exercises to avoid high blood sugar is water aerobics, it's been claimed.Diabetes patients could benefit by adding water aerobics to their workout routine, according to medical website Diabetes.co.uk.Water aerobics are a type of aerobic activity that raises the heart rate and makes you sweat.These types of exercises could also lower your risk diabetes complications, including heart disease and strokes.""People with diabetes are encouraged to exercise regularly for better blood sugar control and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases,"" said Diabetes.co.uk.""The reason for this is that muscles which are working use more glucose than those that are resting.""Muscle movement leads to greater sugar uptake by muscle cells and lower blood sugar levels.""Aerobic activity at moderate intensity basically means exercising at a level that raises your heart rate and makes you sweat.""This includes a multitude of sports. For example, fast-paced walking, rowing, bike riding, and water aerobics.""Everyone should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week.But just because your heart rate is slightly raised, it doesn't mean to say it counts toward your 150 minutes, it warned.Certain household chores, including cutting the grass and cleaning your home aren't demanding enough on the body to count as good exercise.Many people may have diabetes without even knowing it, as the symptoms don't necessarily make you feel unwell.Common diabetes symptoms include passing more urine than normal, feeling very tired, and having cuts or wounds that take longer to heal than normal.Diagnosing the condition early is crucial, as diabetes raises the risk of heart disease and strokes.Speak to a doctor if you're worried about the symptoms of diabetes, or if you think you may be at risk.A quick blood test should be enough to reveal whether you have diabetes, or not.",https://t.co/hIOaq7rYBE,news
Type 2 diabetes: The best type of tea to prevent blood sugar from rising,"Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications with the heart, eyes, nerves, kidneys and feet if not controlled properly. Medication is often used to keep the condition under control, but it's also important to follow a healthy diet that is low in sugar, calories and fat. As well as cutting down on unhealthy foods, you may be able to keep type 2 diabetes under control by consuming foods which can help to improve insulin sensitivity and therefore blood sugar levels. According to Diabetes.co.uk, tea is one drink which may be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. The diabetes expert notes research has shown tea may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the first place.This is because certain types of tea contain micronutrients called polyphenols, which may increase insulin activity.Polyphenols are packed with antioxidants which can help protect against inflammation and carcinogens – properties which can help prevent type 2 diabetes.However, Diabetes.co.uk notes one study of the popular drink found adding milk decreased the insulin-sensitising effects.The best type of tea to help improve insulin activity is therefore tea without milk, such as black tea, green tea and oolong tea.According to the diabetes expert, a 2009 study showed drinking three cups of tea per day could reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 40 per cent.""Tea is one of the nation's favourite drinks and research suggests it's also a healthy drink,"" said Diabetes.co.uk.""Tea brings a number of health benefits including improving insulin sensitivity.""""However, research notes that some the benefits are best experienced if you drink your tea without milk.""Improving insulin sensitivity is important for people with type 2 diabetes as they either don't produce enough of it or the insulin they do produce is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to control the level of sugar in the blood and transfer it to the cells to be turned into energy.If it is unable to do this, too much sugar will remain in the blood, which is how people develop type 2 diabetes.People with type 2 diabetes are also advised to eat more fruit and vegetables in order to maintain a healthy diet and keep the condition under control.Experts advise that even though fruit contains natural sugars, this is outweighed by the health benefits provided by the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients it has.It's important to cut down on foods high in calories and fat, as these can lead to weight gain, which can increase the risk of diabetes-associated complications.People who are overweight are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in the first place.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types – type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.SourceDaily Express :: Health Feedweight lossRecommended Stories",https://t.co/K0GnWz9Vl4,news
Diabetes type 2 diet: Prevent high blood sugar symptoms with muesli breakfast,"Diabetes is a common condition that affects more than four million people in the UK, and 90 per cent of cases are caused by type 2 diabetes. The condition may be caused by the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the body not reacting to insulin. Without enough of the hormone, the body struggles to convert sugar in the blood into useable energy. But you could lower your risk of diabetes symptoms by regularly eating muesli, it's been claimed.Unsweetened muesli is one of the best cereals for diabetes patients, according to medical website Medical News Today.It's a fibre-rich, low-sugar alternative to some more common brands of cereal, it said.But, if you decide to eat muesli for breakfast, it's a good idea to use unsweetened almond milk instead of regular cow's milk.""Sugary cereals, bagels with cream cheese, and fried bacon are all popular breakfast foods, but they are not healthful options and can be poor choices for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.""The best breakfast is one that is high in fibre but low in added sugar, carbohydrates, and salt.""The fibre in cereals may help a person control their blood sugar levels, but many popular brands of cereal are high in sugar and low in fibre, including those that manufacturers advertise as being healthful.""Unsweetened muesli with unsweetened almond milk offers a fibre-rich, low-sugar alternative.""People can use the five-five rule when navigating the cereal aisle, which means aiming for a product that contains at least 5g of fibre and less than 5g of sugar per serving.""Meanwhile you could also lower your risk of high blood sugar by eating eggs for breakfast.People that eat the most eggs are up to 38 per cent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared to those that eat the least, it added.They could also help patients with their weight loss routines. Obesity is, in itself, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.Many people may have diabetes without even knowing it, because the symptoms don't necessarily make you feel unwell.Common diabetes symptoms include having an unquenchable thirst, feeling very tired, and passing more urine than normal.Speak to a doctor if you're worried about the symptoms of diabetes, or if you think you may be at risk.You could lower your risk of the condition by eating a healthy, balanced diet, and by doing regular exercise.Everyone should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week.",https://t.co/k96DA0KBcP,news
What's New In Diabetes Management? Focus On The Individual!,"Finally! Healthcare providers are shifting the focus of care to the needs of patients as individuals. This is a monumental change from the mindset of ""Every patient with ABC is treated with the XYZ plan of care.""Instead of automatically assigning you the same diet, medication and exercise plan as every other diabetic patient, emphasis is placed on what works for you as the individual. In recent years, patients have not been allowed, let alone encouraged to be directly involved in developing their own plans of care. Times are changing, and diabetics have to take advantage.Educate &amp; Empower YourselfWhen it comes to managing diabetes, knowledge is power. The more information you have, the better decisions you can make. Work with your healthcare team to develop a realistic plan of care for your high blood sugar. If your physician prescribes medication, take it as directed. While lifestyle changes are the key to reversing diabetes and achieving your best health long-term, prescription medications can help bring blood sugar to a level that is actually manageable.FoodFood is life… literally! This may be the most difficult shift in lifestyle when working with your healthcare team. Food is personal, even emotional for many people. Food cultures and traditions are deeply ingrained in us, and can be incredibly impactful to our happiness.Even if a certain food makes us happy, some things that just aren't good for the body. Any other French fry lovers out there? However, that doesn't mean that a healthful diet can't be delicious and satisfying. How about a little change in perspective?Start by taking a closer look at the opinions and feelings you attach to certain foods. For example, do you think of a doughnut as an evil enemy sent to tempt and destroy you? Do you picture good health when you see an apple?Resist labeling foods as good or bad. This gives food too much power and influence over your thoughts. It is true that some foods are better for your body (and blood sugar) than others, but no single food determines your overall health or well-being. When you cook and eat real, quality foods it becomes obvious that nutritious can be delicious. Avocados, berries, even olive oil and garlic are just a few foods that pack a powerful punch!Avocados have a positive impact on insulin levels. Monounsaturated fats help boost insulin function, and aid in keeping blood sugar lower and more stable. An avocado is a great source of fiber, which helps to regulate blood sugar, as well.Loaded with fiber and antioxidants, raspberries and blackberries top the list with more than 7 grams of fiber per cup. Blueberries are also a great source of vitamins and soluble fiber. Studies have found that glucose levels reduce over time when blueberries are included in one's diet.The world has been enjoying the health benefits of olives and olive oil for thousands of years. Those benefits are due to healthy fats, phytonutrients, as well as, a variety of vitamins and antioxidants. A team of Virginia Tech researchers discovered that the compound oleuropein found in olives encourages the body to secrete more insulin, helping to reduce blood sugar and better control diabetes!Garlic has been revered as a contributor to better health for centuries. Research is starting to suggest that it may even show promise for lowering blood sugar. A 2005 study which administered garlic orally to diabetic rats recorded significant decreases in blood glucose. Researchers also found that garlic can lower total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and increase insulin production.Work with your healthcare team to develop a meal plan to include the right combination of healthy fats, fiber, and protein. Talk about the foods you love and the foods you don't. Find countless recipes online and find creative ways to adapt them to your taste. Bottom line: if you don't like it, you won't eat it. Figure out what tastes best to you!ExerciseRegular physical activity contributes nearly countless positive effects on your health, especially for those with diabetes. It helps your body make the best use of insulin and glucose, which controls blood sugar more effectively. In fact, exercise can reduce blood sugar levels for up to 24 hours after working out.Regular physical activity also lowers blood pressure, improves circulation, and helps control cholesterol levels, thereby reducing risk of heart attack and stroke. Exercise also helps to strengthen muscles and bones, along with burning extra body fat. It's a great way to boost energy levels and reduce stress, too!While many Americans fall short of the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity per week, research has shown that even a short walk each day can make a major difference in your health.Talk with your physician about which exercise methods are right for you. Bad knee? Low impact exercises are the way to go. Absolutely love going for a swim? That's a great way to get active! Just like with food, figure out what works best for you.SleepThe body's reaction to lack of sleep can mimic insulin resistance. Insulin resistance occurs due to the cell's inability to utilize insulin. This results in high blood sugar. Quality sleep is essential to a happy and healthy life for everyone, and especially for diabetics.One way to help improve your night's sleep is to form a bedtime routine. Perhaps you enjoy a warm bath each night before bed; add some lavender or chamomile bath oil to relax your muscles and your mind. You may prefer to sleep with a fan in your room for noise and air circulation. Avoid looking at brightly lit screens (television, cell phone) before bed as these devices stimulate your brain and keep you awake.Some people need more sleep than others. Track your sleep and talk with your physician about what you find. Does 6 hours of sleep leave you feeling refreshed or more like a zombie? Do you need 9 hours just to feel more human than bear? Don't skip this step – sleep is key!StressFeeling stressed or anxious? Studies have shown that coming home after a long day and preparing a meal can significantly lower stress and anxiety!How you ask? Your mind becomes occupied with the task at hand – finding a recipe, collecting all of your ingredients from the fridge and pantry, compiling them one by one to create something delicious, then getting to sit down and enjoy your hard work. That ""present"" mindset can be very helpful in reducing anxiety, and cooking meals at home is a great way to get started.Research has also found that just a few minutes of meditation every day alters the pathways in your brain, making you more resilient to stress. This helps to improve not only your mental sense of well-being, but your physical one, as well. Give it a try! Meditation, prayer, or yoga are all great options for decreasing stress and increasing energy.Don't be afraid to talk with your healthcare team about how you're feeling. This endeavor to improve health and blood sugar is a big deal that comes with big emotions. There is absolutely no shame in speaking with your doctor about your stress levels, inability to sleep, frustrations with diet, lack of support from family and friends, etc. The mind and the body are truly connected. One cannot exist or thrive without the health of the other.In conclusion, it's time diabetics take advantage of healthcare's shift in focus. Get involved in your care – ask questions. Be your own advocate in your journey to better health. That journey is comprised of many steps. Some of those steps may be larger, or more uncomfortable than others. However, the destination of lower blood sugar and better health is worth every single step!

Type 2 diabetes: The tasty and popular spice that may help to lower blood sugar,"Type 2 diabetes happens when the level of sugar in a person's blood is too high. It can be controlled with medication, but also by improving your diet. The most obvious dietary change to improve the condition is to cut down on sugar, as well as other unhealthy foods. But studies have shown some other foods contain properties which can help to lower blood sugar, so it could be worth including more of these in your diet. One spice which may help to control blood sugar levels is ginger.Ginger is the thick, knotted, underground stem of zingiber officinale plant, and is widely used as a spice and in traditional medicine.Native to Africa, India, China, Australia and Jamaica, ginger is commonly used as a spice or flavouring agent in cooking, and as a herbal treatment for nausea and indigestion.According to Diabetes.co.uk, a 2012 study suggested ginger may improve long-term blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes.Researchers found extracts from Australian-grown ginger can increase uptake of glucose into muscle cells without using insulin, so may therefore assist in the management of high blood sugar levels.Type 2 diabetes develops in people who either don't produce enough insulin, or the insulin produced is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to transfer the sugar in the blood to the cells to be turned into energy.In addition, research in 2009 showed two different ginger extracts - spissum and an oily extract - interact with serotonin receptors to reverse their effect on insulin secretion.Treatment with the extracts led to a 35 per cent drop in blood glucose levels and a 10 per cent increase in plasma insulin levels.A 2010 study also revealed a small daily dose of ginger helped delay the onset and progression of cataracts in diabetic rats.Cataracts are one of the sight-related complications of long-term diabetes.The condition can also lead to other eye issues, as well as problems with the nerves, feet, kidneys and heart.""It's also worth noting that ginger has a very low glycemic index (GI),"" said Diabetes.co.uk.The GI is a rating system for foods containing carbohydrates. It shows how quickly each food affects your blood sugar level when that food is eaten on its own.""Low GI foods break down slowly to form glucose and therefore do not trigger a spike in blood sugar levels as high GI foods do,"" said Diabetes.co.uk.Ginger can be used in cooking fresh, dried or powdered, or as a juice or oil.Another spice which has been shown to improve blood sugar levels, is cinnamon.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes.

How an Obsolete Medical Device With a Security Flaw Became a Must-Have For Some Patients With Type 1 Diabetes,"108485720story From a report on The Atlantic: In 2014, a few hackers realized that the security flaw in certain Medtronic pumps could be exploited for a DIY revolution. Type 1 diabetes is a disease where the pancreas is unable to produce insulin to control blood sugar. For years, Boss (the anecdote in the story who purchased used insulin pumps from some dealer on Craiglist) had counted, down to the gram, the carbohydrates in every meal and told his pump how much insulin to dispense. [...] By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas -- a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin -- were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop. They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems -- none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one. Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work -- for now.",https://t.co/DldNUH2sba,news
Shop with a Dietitian: 5 Diabetes-Friendly Recipes and Shopping List,"Diabetes and high blood sugar go hand in hand. The type you have — type 2, type 1, or prediabetes — dictates how your body reacts to sugar in the blood. Since the reaction is often dependent on what you eat, diet is one of the best ways to help regulate fluctuating blood sugar levels.The American Diabetes Association agrees that medical nutrition therapy is important at all levels of diabetes prevention and management.When it comes to diabetes and dietary needs, Alison Evert, a registered dietitian (RD) and certified diabetes educator (CDE) at University of Washington Medicine, says to think of it less like a ""diet"" and more like an ""eating plan.""""Diet has a negative connotation and is usually a short-term thing that's used to lose 10 pounds,"" she says. Instead, a meal plan is something that should be constructed to fit your ongoing individual needs.This means that people with diabetes — especially those who have T2 or have been diagnosed with prediabetes — can follow just about any trendy meal plan (like keto or paleo) they choose… with one caveat. ""Carbohydrate component of the meal/snack is the main determinant of the post-meal blood glucose level,"" Evert says.This doesn't mean that everyone has to restrict carbohydrate intake. But choosing carbs wisely can have the biggest positive impact on managing blood glucose levels.In fact, research has shown that counting carbs can be an effective way to not only help plan your meals, but improve blood sugar control.Carbohydrates are usually thought of as anything with grains: pasta, bread, cereals, etc. But there are sneaky sources of carbs hiding in foods we might initially think belong in a different category.The reason why carbohydrates should be monitored by people with diabetes is that your body breaks them down into sugars — mostly glucose — which raises blood sugar. Even though foods high in carbs don't always necessarily taste sweet, that's how your body reacts to them. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all eating plan for everyone. Studies have found improvements in blood sugar levels when carbs were restricted to 20 grams or less per day, while the general recommendation is between 135 to 230 grams per day. Main takeaway Anywhere from 20–90 grams of carbs daily might be healthy for someone with diabetes. To determine the right amount for you, the most important thing is to track your carb- and fiber-intake and then test your blood sugar two hours after eating. Then work with your medical team to decide what's best for your body. Additionally, foods that are naturally sweet, like fruit, can contain carbs in high numbers. According to the ADA, a small piece of fruit or a half cup of frozen or canned fruit can contain about 15 grams of carbs. ""A fruit smoothie (such as Jamba Juice) has over 100 grams of carbs, but it's in a liquid form. It has the same amount of carbs as five pieces of fruit and a glass of milk. I don't know if I could eat five pieces of fruit, but it's pretty easy to drink down a smoothie,"" Evert says.That's a good reason to be mindful of the nutrients you're putting into your body.Other sneaky sources of carbsMilk has a surprisingly high-carbohydrate content, meaning that tempting iced cafe mocha could have nearly 40 grams of carbs.Starchy veggies like sweet potatoes, white potatoes, and corn are sources of carbohydrates. Because carbs quickly break down into sugar, one way to delay their digestion and absorption is to increase fiber intake — depending on the type of fiber. There are two types of fiber: insoluble and soluble. When it comes to helping people with diabetes, look for soluble fiber.Foods that are high in soluble fiber include:lentilsartichokespeasbroccoliblack beansavocadosbarleyShare on PinterestManaging carbs and coming up with a well-balanced meal plan is easier when using the Plate Method. Visualize a dinner plate. Fill half with non-starchy vegetables, one quarter with a protein, and the remaining quarter with a starch. So, what goes on your plate? Non-starchy vegetables (50 percent of your plate) are anything green: spinach, kale, broccoli, asparagus, green beans, zucchini, Brussels sprouts, and chard. Also, look for cauliflower, carrots, fennel, and radishes, or salad greens like romaine, arugula, or watercress. Smart protein choices (25 percent of your plate) include: lean meats such as chicken or turkey breast, or fatty fish like salmon, shrimp, and whitefish (rockfish and halibut). Try to limit red meat or overly fatty meats like bacon or sausage. Starches and things that should be counted as carbs (25 percent of your plate) include: peas, beans like kidney, chickpea, or black, and whole grains like barley, farro, buckwheat, or quinoa. What about dessert? When it comes to things like dessert, Evert says to think in moderation.Shoot for fresh berries, dark chocolate, or single-serving items in order to curb temptation. Greek yogurt is a good option, as it's usually lower in carbs and sugar than many other types of yogurt. Remember, as Evert says ""Rome was not built in a day."" If you're into trying meal planning, start with a couple of meals per week and work up. ""No one can go from eating out all the time to making all their own meals,"" she says.As much as Evert stresses that each person is different — meaning each meal plan should be customized — it's easier to be armed with a list when you're a beginner. This shopping list is based on a few recipes that will help you kickstart your diabetes-friendly eating plan and lay the groundwork for the great things to come. Evert says that most of her clients are surprised after beginning a diabetes-friendly eating plan, saying it just looks like ""eating healthy."" These recipes can be kept as-is or scaled up for meal prepping for the week. After a week or so, the routine will be an easy new normal, allowing you to build your own personal cookbook of go-to, friendly, (and tasty) meals.""The meal plan that's successful is the one that the person can follow for the rest of their life,"" Evert says. Recipes you'll be shopping for: Turkey spinach frittataGreen salmon with barley and green beansChicken breast with roasted fennel and tomatoesSalad with easy vinaigretteGreek yogurt and berry popsiclesTake an inventory of your current pantry and fridge situation. You'll want to stock up on healthy cooking essentials like olive oil, while getting rid of high-carb temptations like white rice or bread, and processed items like chips or cookies. Healthy Shopping Tip Try not to shop hungry and stick to your list — while also sticking to the outside of the grocery store, avoiding the middle aisles filled with processed temptations.Consider buying things like farro or barley in bulk and making a large quantity alongside large tubs of salad mix and larger portions of protein. Cooking up a few cups of farro and a few pounds of chicken at a time means easy grain salads during the week, helping you to be prepared when hunger strikes. The list below includes the amounts needed to recreate all recipes, but feel free to bulk up on a few in order to meal prep or cook for friends and family. Pro-tip: Most recipes makes 2 servings. For those of you who love meal prepping, simply double or triple the recipes.Produce ProteinPantryShare on PinterestServes 2Ingredients1-lb. salmon fillet, deboned1 tsp. olive oil1/2 cup hulled barley2 cups water1 clove garlic, smashedsalt and pepper, to taste2 tbsp. green sauce (recipe below)DirectionsPreheat oven to 275°F.Combine barley, water, and garlic clove in a pot.

22 Warning Signs That You Immediately Need Magnesium And How To Get It,"Magnesium is a key mineral in hundreds of functions in the body and is involved in over 300 enzyme-driven biochemical reactions.It is the second most plentiful positive-charged-ion in the cellular fluid, next to potassium, and its role is complex and versatile.Its sufficient amounts in the body are essential to achieving the delicate balance that ensures the smooth-running of all functions of the body.Namely, it is a cofactor for numerous nutrients that are used as building blocks to create the body structure and enables thousands of biochemical processes, such as the production of cholesterol, antioxidants and proteins, DNA and RNA creation, temperature regulation, and breaking down of glucose and fat.It also produces energy inside mitochondria, metabolizing them into usable energy and storing them.It relaxes the muscles, and thus prevents cramps. It maintains the healthy balance of electrolytes in the body, and thus impacts nerve impulses, heart rhythm, and muscle contractions.Magnesium is vital for the electrical transmission of thoughts to the nervous system and to various parts of the body.Unfortunately, magnesium deficiency is a common issue, mostly because the body cannot produce it on its own, even though it is the fourth most abundant mineral in a human body.There are also other factors that contribute to magnesium deficiency, such as:Foods low in magnesium due to the fact that they have been grown in a magnesium-deficient soilExcessive consumption of high- fat foods, sodas, sugar, processed foods, and saltDrinking water fortified with fluoride depletes the body of magnesiumThe consumption of calcium-rich foods, as the ideal ratio of calcium and magnesium, is 1:1Long-term use of certain medication and stressInefficient intestinal absorption reduces the absorption of magnesiumThe early signs of magnesium deficiency include fatigue, appetite loss, weakness, muscle twitching, headaches, and nausea.If left untreated, it can lead to more serious symptoms, such as anxiety, coronary spasms, abnormal heartbeat rate, seizures, muscle contractions and spasms, numbness and tingling.Magnesium deficiency has been linked to numerous health issues and conditions including:InfertilityType 2 diabetesEpilepsyInflammatory diseasesAtherosclerosis and arteriosclerosisCardiac arrhythmiasMuscle pain and crampsInsomnia and other sleep disordersNervousnessObesityAnxiety, depression, confusion, angerAsthmaKidney stonesMigraines and headachesCholesterol oxidationOsteoporosisPMS, PCOSChronic fatigue syndromeCoronary heart diseaseStrokeFibromyalgiaHypertensionTherefore, in order to prevent these problems, you need to optimize the magnesium levels in your body.First of all, you should juice your greens, and drink fresh green vegetable juice daily.You should also increase the intake of magnesium-high foods, such as avocados, dried fruits, salmon, okra, mackerel, broccoli, dark chocolate, pumpkin seeds, eggs, parsnips, boiled spinach, almonds, cashews, and okra.If you decide to take magnesium in the form of supplements, your best choices would be magnesium threonate and citrate. Yet, take a look at the following options:Magnesium threonate has a superior ability to penetrate the mitochondrial membrane and is believed to be the best magnesium supplementMagnesium carbonate contains 45 % magnesiumMagnesium taurate calms the body and mind and contains a combination of magnesium and taurine, an amino acidMagnesium glycinate is a chelated form of magnesium, which provides the highest levels of absorption and bioavailability.Magnesium oxide is a non-chelated type of magnesium, bound to an organic acid or a fatty acidMagnesium citrate is a combination of magnesium with citric acidMagnesium chloride/Magnesium lactate contain only 12 percent magnesium but offers better absorptionMagnesium sulfate/Magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia) are typically used as laxativesYou can also boost your magnesium levels by enjoying an Epsom salt bath, and by topically applying magnesium oil.You should definitely try the following delicious, magnesium-rich recipe:Gluten-free breakfast power bowlsIngredients:2 –3 tbsp chia6–8oz coconut or almond milk3 tbsp slivered almonds or seeds1 tbsp cocoa nibs or dark chocolate chips2/3 cup cooked quinoablueberriesbananasdash of lemon juice1/4 tsp vanilla extract1 tbsp honey or agave nectar1 tbsp melted nut butterpomegranate seeds (optional)Instructions:In a serving bowl, mix the quinoa and chia seeds. Drizzle the nut butter and honey on top, and add the milk and vanilla extract.Mix well, and then add a dash of lemon juice, and top the bowl with cocoa, blueberries, and nuts.Store the mixture in the fridge for at least 4-5 hours, or overnight. Then, add the sliced banana, drizzle with milk and honey, and pomegranate seeds, if you have chosen to add.This is a great and healthy way to start the day and optimize your magnesium levels!Enjoy!Sources:https://juicing-for-health.com/https://www.cottercrunch.com/",https://t.co/DcK1k38XhC,news
Study: Even Healthy People Get Blood Sugar Spikes,"TUESDAY, July 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- You'd expect big blood sugar fluctuations in people with diabetes. But for those without the disorder, blood sugar levels should remain fairly stable, right? Maybe not, says a new study. Researchers found some people who don't have diabetes still have wild swings in their blood sugar levels after they eat. Among nearly 60 participants, the study authors identified three ""glucotypes"" based on how much blood sugar spiked after eating -- low, moderate and severe. The study also found that certain foods were more likely to prompt an extreme change in blood sugar (glucose) than others. ""Even if you don't have diabetes, you may not have normal glucose. There are a lot of people with glucose dysfunction out there who don't know it,"" said the study's lead author, Michael Snyder. He's director of genomics and personalized medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine, in California. Snyder said this finding is potentially concerning because spikes in blood sugar levels have been associated with risk of heart attack and stroke. And it's possible -- though it hasn't been proven in this study -- that people who have big rises in their blood sugar after eating may have a higher risk of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem, affecting more than 30 million U.S. adults and 422 million worldwide, the authors noted. But not every medical expert is convinced that these changes in blood sugar in healthy people are something to be concerned about. Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, pointed out that the study population was small. That makes it difficult to draw conclusions about blood sugar pattern ""types,"" he said. Zonszein was not involved with the research. The study volunteers ""were separated into low, moderate and severe spikes. But there may be many other patterns,"" he said. ""Absorption, storage and utilization of [sugars] is highly regulated and difficult to characterize by only three different patterns."" Zonszein added that blood sugar metabolism is complex and affected by many different variables.",https://t.co/7U6kAFdWZ0,news

Type 2 diabetes: Drinking this type of tea may help to prevent blood sugar rises,"Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications with the heart, eyes, nerves, kidneys and feet if not controlled properly. Medication is often used to keep the condition under control, but it's also important to follow a healthy diet that is low in sugar, calories and fat. As well as cutting down on unhealthy foods, you may be able to keep type 2 diabetes under control by consuming foods which can help to improve insulin sensitivity and therefore blood sugar levels. According to Diabetes.co.uk, tea is one drink which may be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes.The diabetes expert notes research has shown tea may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the first place.This is because certain types of tea contain micronutrients called polyphenols, which may increase insulin activity.Polyphenols are packed with antioxidants which can help protect against inflammation and carcinogens - properties which can help prevent type 2 diabetes.However, Diabetes.co.uk notes one study of the popular drink found adding milk decreased the insulin-sensitising effects.The best type of tea to help improve insulin activity is therefore tea without milk, such as black tea, green tea and oolong tea.According to the diabetes expert, a 2009 study showed drinking three cups of tea per day could reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 40 per cent.""Tea is one of the nation's favourite drinks and research suggests it's also a healthy drink,"" said Diabetes.co.uk.""Tea brings a number of health benefits including improving insulin sensitivity.""""However, research notes that some the benefits are best experienced if you drink your tea without milk.""Improving insulin sensitivity is important for people with type 2 diabetes as they either don't produce enough of it or the insulin they do produce is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to control the level of sugar in the blood and transfer it to the cells to be turned into energy.If it is unable to do this, too much sugar will remain in the blood, which is how people develop type 2 diabetes.People with type 2 diabetes are also advised to eat more fruit and vegetables in order to maintain a healthy diet and keep the condition under control.Experts advise that even though fruit contains natural sugars, this is outweighed by the health benefits provided by the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients it has.It's important to cut down on foods high in calories and fat, as these can lead to weight gain, which can increase the risk of diabetes-associated complications.People who are overweight are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in the first place.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.",https://t.co/0MVpmYWbcN,news
Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,"" Platt, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,"" Colberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""For example, the message 'seek medical help' is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,"" Colberg added.

Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,"" Platt, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,"" Colberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""For example, the message 'seek medical help' is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,"" Colberg added. ""Self-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps."" SOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.",https://t.co/9TGpZq3nbs,news
Best supplements for diabetes: The plant-based capsules that could help lower blood sugar,"Type 2 diabetes is a common condition in the UK that can lead to long-term health complications with the eyes, kidneys, nerves and feet. People with the condition may require medication, but one of the best ways to keep blood sugar levels in check is to follow a healthy diet. Experts recommend eating a wide range of foods, including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta, and keeping sugar fat and salt to a minimum. Additionally, adding a certain nutrient to your diet can help regulate blood sugar, according to research.A 2019 review of studies, published in Phytopherapy Research, found taking 500mg or more of quercetin daily for at least eight weeks reduced blood glucose levels in people with metabolic syndrome, who have an increased risk of developing diabetes.Holland &amp; Barrett explains what quercetin is: ""Quercetin is a flavonoid, a natural chemical found in plants that has been shown to have a wide number of health benefits, including reducing inflammation, relieving allergy symptoms, and preventing infection.""Quercetin is available as a supplement but can also be found in a number of foods, including:OnionsCitrus fruitsGreen leafy vegetablesSeedsOlive oilRed grapesBerries When it comes to dosage for supplements, the high street health store advises: ""Doses of 500-100mg a day are considered safe.""Don't take quercetin if you are pregnant or breast-feeding as there isn't enough evidence to show it's safe.""Quercetin can interact with certain medications, so speak to your GP before taking quercetin supplements.""Another supplement which could help type 2 diabetes is chromium. A number of studies have suggested chromium can help regulate blood sugar levels. A 2012 study carried out by the USA's University of Wyoming found chromium helps blood glucose levels by boosting the actions of insulin – the hormone responsible for regulating the release of glucose into the cells.In 2003 a study published in Nutrition Research Reviews reported that the type of chromium used in supplements – chromium picolinate – is able to curb insulin resistance, which can be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes.Chromium is a trace mineral, which means your body needs it in tiny amounts.It plays an important role in turning the food we eat into energy, but it can't be made by our bodies, so we must get it from foods, such as broccoli, potatoes and wholegrain.As well as in food, chromium is available as chromium picolinate in tablets and can also be found in multivitamins.

Superfood Popular Among Surfers Eradicates Cancer Cells While Reducing Blood Sugar and Cholesterol in Overweight Adults,"Photo via Wikipedia Commons and WSOC-TV Charlotte For most people, the consumption of berries is limited to only a few different types, and they are almost never organic.Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries (in that order) are the three most popular types in the U.S., but they're almost never organic and are often heavily sprayed with chemicals, including strawberries which ranked #1 on the 2018 'Dirty Dozen' list by the Environmental Working Group.While these berries are still relatively beneficial in comparison to other popular foods that make up the ""Standard American Diet,"" they're still a far cry from being truly healthy.And as fate would have it, there's one particular berry most Americans are missing out on that could solve some of the most common and debilitating health problems they face each day. Acai: The Powerful Brazilian Superfood That Destroys Cancer Cells Even as we continue to throw billions of dollars at the mantle of ""Breast Cancer Awareness,"" the problem shows little sign of slowing.According to current statistics from the website BreastCancer.org, 1 in 8 women will develop invasive breast cancer in their lifetime, and critics say not enough is being done in the field of prevention.Meanwhile, metastatic breast cancer remains the most overlooked and understudied killer of women that the Susan G. Komen Foundation and others are not doing enough to address, according to former Los Angeles Times columnist named Laurie Becklund who passed away from the disease and wrote this heart-wrenching final letter beforehand.It goes without saying, but we are not doing enough to address the root causes of breast cancer, which begins largely with diet. The good news, however, is that there are plenty of healthy superfoods out there capable of tackling this problem, starting with the humble purple acai berry out of Brazil and other parts of South America. The health benefits of the acai berry include:-The ability to reduce blood sugar levels in adults (the serving amount was 100 grams of acai pulp per day)-The ability to increase resting antioxidant levels in the blood 3-fold, according to PubMed–Powerful benefits for athletes who engage in high intensity athletic activities (acai smoothie bowls are a favorite, cultural staple of surfers and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competitors alike)-Benefits for regulating healthy insulin levels-The ability to reduce cholesterol in overweight adultsAnd last but not least, the ability to eradicate breast cancer cells, to the tune of 55% of all cells in a laboratory setting. While further trials need to be done in order to figure out exactly how this all works in the human body, it's a promising additional benefit to what is already one of the healthiest berries in the world, renowned for its brain protective powers.If you want to reap these benefits, there's one thing to keep in mind, however: taking an acai supplement with high levels of PACs (proanthocyanidins) is the biggest key, according to PubMed.These are the unique type of antioxidants found to be highly effective cancer cell fighters in previous studies, that are found in everything from red wine to dark chocolate and even grape seed extracts.If you're looking for the best health gains, however, eating smoothies or the famous acai smoothie bowls made from whole berries may be the healthiest and most cost effective way, especially taking into account the high price of most quality acai supplements.If you're looking for whole acai berries, they are almost always found frozen in health food stores or even some grocery stores, as well as online through traditional brands like AmaFruits and Sambazon. Final Thoughts on Acai Health Benefits If you've never tried the acai berry before, you're missing out.While it has taken awhile for the world to warm up to the taste of this widely revered superfood, those who've tried it and know the way it makes them feel have become lifelong fans. According to one story the fruit was not nearly as popular as it is today in Brazil before outsiders began coming in and harvesting it, because the taste was not thought to be sweet enough to be worth eating.Now, acai ice cream is a popular delicacy, as are the aforementioned acai bowls, which often include fruit purees like dragonfruit or banana, yogurt and/or granola, and are topped with everything from pumpkinseeds to raw cacao nibs, blueberries, shredded coconut, and other highly energizing foods to create one of the most delicious and functional breakfasts you could ever try.Acai bowls have also caught on at health food stores and cafes in the U.S. and throughout the world.report this adI personally am a huge fan of homemade acai bowls, with a mix of half acai and half dragonfruit, the latter of which removes some of the chalky texture the berry was originally shunned for in some parts of Brazil.The taste takes a little while to warm up to because it's more understated than more typically sweet berries, but the depth, complexity and highly unique taste of acai make it one berry that's hard to forget.Check it out if you get the chance, and be sure to tell others in your family, especially those you might know who are struggling with blood sugar, cholesterol and the other similar health issues mentioned above.In this case, one simple superfood, taken consistently, really can make a dramatic difference.For more articles like these in your inbox (plus a free 'Healing Secrets of the Amazon' eBook), click here.

Parenting Children with Diabetes,"Trying to stop a Low Blood Sugar binge is like trying to keep your hand on a hot stove—it's against your natural instinct. Our body's natural instinct is to pull the hand away when we feel the heat. When blood sugar is low, our natural drive is to eat. Therefore, if your blood sugars remain low even after you eat, the brain gets hijacked.Even when you know you have counteracted the hypoglycemic reaction (with food, a glucose tablet, or juice, for example), it's hard to make yourself stop eating. Difficulty stopping happens because your brain is still receiving that ""hungry"" message. Your body and mind remain on high alert while pushing you to eat more, in the same way that the brain tells the hand to pull away from the hot stove.StarvationAt the point you feel like you are starving, you will eat just about anything regardless of the consequences. One of my more memorable binges was a few years ago – right before bed. I ended up eating myself out of house and home. It felt so good to binge that evening!The consequences of that evening were great. I woke up with my stomach feeling woozy. I tossed and turned all night. When I woke up the next morning, my blood glucose was through the roof. My blood sugar levels bounced around all day until I eventually leveled out 24 hours later. Never again I said to myself, but I have said that many times before. Back in 2011 at 9:00 am on one Sunday morning, I check my morning blood sugar: 39 mg/dl. ""Where did I go wrong?"" I said to myself and then realized I didn't have time to figure it out. I downed 8oz of lemonade. I proceeded to wait. But I couldn't wait. But I knew I'd have to, or I would feel like crap the rest of the day. I was famished.Binge or Not to Binge? So here I am, facing that epic question again: to binge or not to binge? I poured myself another glass of lemonade and started looking for something to eat in the refrigerator.So I found what I was looking for: pre-made tuna fish salad, nothing to make and easy to eat. I grabbed the container and a small fork, the kind one uses when you're just starting to eat real food as a child. With this little fork, I slowly ate in small forkfuls while sipping the lemonade. By the time my blood sugar had returned to normal, and my hunger drifted away and I only drank an additional 4 ounces of lemonade and 1/8th of a pound of tuna fish. I gave myself a small injection for the extra lemonade.Two hours later, my blood sugar levels returned normal and my day wasn't ruined by shifting high and low blood sugars. I consider this technique ""Low Blood Sugar Binge Prevention.""

"Aerobics and strength training: Best exercises for people with type 2 diabetes to manage weight, blood sugar","Aerobics and strength training: Best exercises for people with type 2 diabetes to manage weight, blood sugar&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Physical activity is a vital component of management for people with type 2 diabetes. Along with medications, adopting a healthy lifestyle, which includes eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, can help keep your blood sugar levels at a healthy range. If you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, monitoring blood glucose levels is an important part of treatment.Staying active will not only help you get a lean and fit body. It will also help improve health and reduce the risk of developing several conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, etc. But if you have diabetes, it's particularly important for you to stay active. Exercise has immense health benefits, but the biggest one is that it can control your blood sugar, making it easier for you to manage the symptoms while also preventing long-term complications diabetes can cause.What types of exercise are ideal for people with type 2 diabetes?The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends two types of physical activity for managing diabetes - aerobic exercise and strength training. The organisation suggests that one should aim for 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise at least 5 days a week or a total of 150 minutes per week. If you're unable to do the entire 30 minutes all at once, you can actually break up the exercise into chunks - say 10 minutes in three shorter workouts. Research has shown that the health benefits are the same when you do this.If you're overweight and trying to lose weight and keep it off, you would need to increase your activity levels to 60 minutes of aerobic exercise per day. Aerobic activities include brisk walking, bicycling, dancing, swimming, stair climbing, jogging/running, hiking, moderate-to-heavy gardening, etc.Examples of strength training activities are using resistance bands, weight machines or free weights at the gym, lifting light weights or objects like bottles at home, classes that involve strength training, exercises that use your own body weight to build up strength like pushups, sit ups, squats, lunges, wall-sits and planks. Apart from aerobic activity, the ADA recommends doing some type of strength training at least 2 times per week.How to get startedBeginners would want to begin with 5 or 10 minutes a day, especially if you haven't been very active recently. Then, you can increase your activity sessions by a few minutes each week. But to get started on a good, safer exercise plan, you should first talk to your doctor who will be able to check your heart health, which is particularly critical if you already have high blood pressure or blocked arteries.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Kind Snacks - Because All Women Need a Healthy Snack in Their Purse,"If you've been reading my blog for a while you probably know I promote eating ""real food."" That means staying away from packaged food that's been processed and contains artificial ingredients. I even wrote a post called the 12 Best Snack Foods for Baby Boomers to Live Longer and Stay Healthy. However, after fainting a couple of times several years ago because of a blood sugar drop, I realized that it helps to have a healthy snack in your purse in case you go too long without eating. Kind Snacks are perfect for this.I've never been a big fan of protein bars. Most of them taste weird and are extremely high in calories. They have some ingredients that are suspect. Kind Snacks are clean. They are gluten-free, low glycemic index, dairy free, Non-GMO, very low sodium, 0g trans fat and are a good source of fiber.My favorite bar is Dark Chocolate Almond and Coconut. It's sweetened with honey, glucose syrup, and a little sugar. Total sugars are 12 g. Glucose sugar is a simple sugar made with plants and some algae. (I had to look it up because I'm careful about my sugar intake)The bars are easy to stick in your purse. TIP: If they contain chocolate don't let them get too warm. If you find yourself needing a blood sugar boost just unwrap and gulp. I love nuts, especially almonds, and a little dark chocolate is good for you.Some of the other flavors I tried were Almond &amp; Coconut, Dark Chocolate, Nuts, &amp; Sea Salt (peanuts and almonds), and Salted Caramel &amp; Dark Chocolate Nut. (peanuts, almonds, &amp; cashews) Each bar is 200 calories. All of them are scrumptious!Kind Snacks PhilosophyKind Snacks believe that if you can't pronounce an ingredient it shouldn't go into your body.

Type 2 diabetes: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?,"Type 2 diabetes management: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?&amp;nbsp New Delhi: You may have heard that drumstick or Moringa oleifera leaves can help maintain blood sugar levels, making it an effective natural remedy to manage diabetes. The plant, often referred to as the miracle tree, has been used for centuries owing to its health benefits. Studies have shown that moringa oleifera contains beneficial antioxidants and bioactive compounds that can help treat and prevent diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, respiratory and skin problems. The moringa tree, which is native to India, is also known by other names such as horseradish tree or ben oil tree.Type 2 diabetes is a major global public health problem that can lead to serious complications if controlled poorly. The condition raises blood glucose (sugar) levels, also known as hyperglycaemia, which may cause damage to the eye, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels. Keeping blood sugar along with body weight under control through a combination of a healthy lifestyle and standard treatment is an important part of diabetes management. Studies show certain herbs and spices blood sugar-lowering properties, and one such being drumstick leaves. Take a look at how this plant can be useful in controlling diabetes.Can Moringa leaves help treat diabetes?Various studies showed effects of moringa leaves on lowering blood sugar levels in diabetes patients and animals, indicating that the plant can be used as a natural way to combat the disease. One study involving 30 women reported that consuming 7 grams of moringa leaf powder everyday for three months helped reduce fasting blood sugar levels 13.5 per cent, on average.Similarly, another small study found that using moringa leaves - about 50 grams - in a meal reduced the rise in blood sugar by some 21 per cent. However, it may be noted that more work is required before making any solid recommendations.Research showed that plant compounds such as isothiocyanates in moringa can help reduce body weight, improve glucose tolerance and insulin signaling in mice fed very high-fat diet (VHFD) supplemented with 5% moringa concentrate (MC). The results also revealed that these mice did not develop fatty liver disease compared to VHFD-fed mice.It is claimed that moringa can help reduce the amount of sugar in the blood, as well as glucose and protein in the urine, which may help treat diabetes.Benefits and risks of Moringa leavesMoringa oleifera is has been used in traditional herbal medicines for many years. The plant is believed to offer many benefits and its uses range from beauty to preventing and curing diseases - such as asthma, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, digestive issues, etc.Moringa leaves are packed with nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are good for your health. However, consuming it is not recommended for pregnant women as moringa may possess anti-fertility qualities. If you have diabetes and are considering using moringa, we suggest you discuss it with your doctor first.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Type 2 diabetes: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?,"Type 2 diabetes management: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?&amp;nbsp New Delhi: You may have heard that drumstick or Moringa oleifera leaves can help maintain blood sugar levels, making it an effective natural remedy to manage diabetes. The plant, often referred to as the miracle tree, has been used for centuries owing to its health benefits. Studies have shown that moringa oleifera contains beneficial antioxidants and bioactive compounds that can help treat and prevent diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, respiratory and skin problems. The moringa tree, which is native to India, is also known by other names such as horseradish tree or ben oil tree.Type 2 diabetes is a major global public health problem that can lead to serious complications if controlled poorly. The condition raises blood glucose (sugar) levels, also known as hyperglycaemia, which may cause damage to the eye, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels. Keeping blood sugar along with body weight under control through a combination of a healthy lifestyle and standard treatment is an important part of diabetes management. Studies show certain herbs and spices blood sugar-lowering properties, and one such being drumstick leaves. Take a look at how this plant can be useful in controlling diabetes.Can Moringa leaves help treat diabetes?Various studies showed effects of moringa leaves on lowering blood sugar levels in diabetes patients and animals, indicating that the plant can be used as a natural way to combat the disease. One study involving 30 women reported that consuming 7 grams of moringa leaf powder everyday for three months helped reduce fasting blood sugar levels 13.5 per cent, on average.Similarly, another small study found that using moringa leaves - about 50 grams - in a meal reduced the rise in blood sugar by some 21 per cent. However, it may be noted that more work is required before making any solid recommendations.Research showed that plant compounds such as isothiocyanates in moringa can help reduce body weight, improve glucose tolerance and insulin signaling in mice fed very high-fat diet (VHFD) supplemented with 5% moringa concentrate (MC). The results also revealed that these mice did not develop fatty liver disease compared to VHFD-fed mice.It is claimed that moringa can help reduce the amount of sugar in the blood, as well as glucose and protein in the urine, which may help treat diabetes.Benefits and risks of Moringa leavesMoringa oleifera is has been used in traditional herbal medicines for many years. The plant is believed to offer many benefits and its uses range from beauty to preventing and curing diseases - such as asthma, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, digestive issues, etc.Moringa leaves are packed with nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are good for your health.

"Eat More Okra: It Prevents Blood Sugar Spikes, Protects the Liver, Brain and Much More","Okra is an incredibly beneficial and versatile fruit that offers a plethora of health benefits and can be used in various ways in the kitchen. Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus, or Hibiscus esculentus) is a flowering plant that belongs to the mallow family (Malvaceae) and produces large yellow flowers and a pod that measures 4-10 inches. It grows in warm climates in South America, the Middle East, and in the southern United States. It is technically a fruit, but is eaten as a vegetable due to the rather savory taste, and is also known as lady's fingers (or, ladies fingers), bhindi, bendakaya, bamia or gumbo. When boiled, it becomes thick, so it is often added to soups, broths, and stews. It can also be pickled, fried, or sautéed. It is a rich source of minerals and vitamins, as well as fiber. A cup of okra provides about 40% your recommended daily vitamin C needs, which boosts the immune system, high amounts of vitamin K that boosts bone health and improves blood clotting, vitamin A, that improves vision and prevents free radical damage, as well as magnesium, potassium, calcium, iron, zinc, and folate.Magnesium regulates blood pressure and blood sugar levels, potassium and calcium improve bone health and muscle function, and folate is essential during pregnancy, and it improves brain function and prevents anemia. Iron ensures the health of the blood, zinc protects DNA and strengthens the immune system, while the dietary fiber improves digestion, and the multiple antioxidants eliminate free radicals.

Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management,"(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google's Android software or Apple's iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. ""People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,"" said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,"" Car said by email. ""But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes."" The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can't prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. ""Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,"" said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,"" Platt, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,"" Colberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""For example, the message 'seek medical help' is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,"" Colberg added. ""Self-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps."" SOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.",https://t.co/shDCXrM87c,news
Better for Blood Sugar and Won't Hurt Your Gut Like Gluten,"Many nutrition experts, myself included, do not recommend consumption of various kinds of bread on a daily basis.The Reasons:Bread can mess up blood sugar levels – most bread contains Amylopectin-A. It is one of the main components of starch and involved in our metabolism. It places the body in a series of high and low blood glucose. Research has shown that Amylopectin-A may promote the development of insulin-resistance which, over time, can lead to diabetes type 2.Highly addictive – bread gives a feeling of euphoria, making the person craves to eat more of it. This makes it difficult to remove it from our diet, even if we want to.It is mucus-forming – this could compromise the respiratory system as the airways are being clogged or blocked.It contains gluten – while there is nothing wrong with consuming gluten-containing whole foods in moderation, many people these days are showing signs of gluten sensitivity.It makes the stomach work harder – the gluten and starches in bread need more time and strong acids to be digested. This makes the stomach work overtime and can give rise to many digestive complaints.It has low nutritional value – most nutrients are stripped when bread is being made.Contains phytates – phytates are plant anti-nutrients that interfere with the absorption of many vitamins and minerals.With these issues at hand, even healthy food items are being investigated and questioned. This includes sourdough bread. Is sourdough bread healthy? Allow the benefits of sourdough bread to answer this question. 1. It contains wild yeast and good bacteria (Lactobacillus)These two ingredients of sourdough bread predigest the starches — hence, it lightens the workload of the stomach and the digestive system as a whole.Aside from this benefit, lactobacilli stimulate the production of lactic acid. This substance stops the negative effect of phytates (found in the flour), which is interfering with the absorption of nutrients. Therefore, the person is guaranteed of taking in all the vitamins, minerals, and healthy elements in sourdough bread.At the same time, lactic acid prevents spikes of blood glucose as it slows down the release of glucose into the bloodstream. It also lowers the glycemic index of the bread; hence, the individual is less susceptible to hyperglycemia or increased blood sugar level.Lastly, the fermentation process (while making the bread) permits other beneficial bacteria to flourish in the gut. This means a healthier gut for the sourdough bread lover.2. It is overloaded with nutrients Unlike commercially prepared bread, sourdough bread has vitamins E, B1-B6, B12, niacin, thiamin, folate, riboflavin, iron, selenium, manganese, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium — not to mention proteins and fatty acids.One thing that sourdough bread does not have (that the other types of bread have) is toxic preservatives. This is because it has its own natural preservative — acetic acid — that inhibits the growth of molds.3. It is safe for the gluten-intolerant individualWhy? The fermentation process of sourdough bread permits good bacteria to break down the gluten proteins into small amounts. This makes sourdough bread tolerable for gluten-sensitive people.Researches and experiments have also revealed that this bread does not damage the intestinal lining of those sensitive to gluten, unlike other bread. There were no reports of clinical symptoms for them, too, that usually come with eating ordinary bread. HHL NOTE: For folks dealing with celiac disease or other forms of severe gluten intolerance you need to make a gluten-free sourdough starter please see the link below. Not ALL sourdough bread is gluten-free.In conclusion, to answer the question, ""Is sourdough bread healthy?"" The answer is plain and simple – ""yes."" But as I have said many times before, moderation and balance are key.Oh!

Are Walnuts Good for Lowering Blood Sugar?,"Managing blood sugar levels isn't just limited to cutting down on certain foods. It is about understanding thoroughly how different kinds of foods affect your blood sugar levels and how to consume them in various combinations to aid in good blood glucose level and improve the overall health. When you have diabetes, all your focus lies on how to control the sugar levels. However, you should keep in mind about eating various foods that prevent complications, especially when it comes to type 2-diabetes.Are Walnuts Good for Lowering Blood Sugar?Amongst all the other nuts available in the market today, walnuts have demonstrated numerous health benefits. This includes improvisation in the functioning of blood vessels and fighting against the free radicals. This is because they are loaded with a high content of antioxidants. According to research conducted at Yale University, it has been found out that walnuts are beneficial in reducing the chances to develop type 2 diabetes amongst adults. A study in the ""Journal of Nutrition"" shows that walnuts have proved to be more effective in reducing the blood glucose levels than the other nuts.Walnuts are an excellent source of alpha-linolenic acid that helps to protect against the formation of plaque in the arteries. Walnuts also contain higher amounts of L-arginine, an amino acid that helps to control blood pressure by relaxing blood pressure. People suffering from diabetes have higher levels of triglycerides and lower levels of HDL. Walnuts are richly sourced with omega 3 fatty acids that help in raising HDL levels and lowering triglyceride levels. Therefore, eating walnuts is much beneficial for people having high blood sugar levels. In fact, researches have proved that consuming a smaller amount of walnuts every day can help in improving a few cardiovascular markers amongst people who are having diabetes.How Much Walnut Should Be Consumed In A Day?It is quite easy to add approximately an ounce of walnuts in your day to day diet. The easiest option to consume them lies in eating them as a snack rather than other alternatives. They are rich in fiber, have lower levels of carbohydrates, and the fat and protein content in them makes you feel satisfied for a longer period of time.Alternatively, you can even include walnuts in various baked dishes, salads, and yogurts.ConclusionVarious studies have found the different effects of consuming walnuts in the daily diet amongst those who suffer from diabetes or are at risk of developing it. Various researchers have found out that eating walnuts have a correlation with lowering the incidence of several heart diseases and lowers the blood sugar levels in both men and women. According to the ""British Journal of Nutrition"", consuming walnuts on daily basis have been beneficial in lowering the levels of blood sugar by up to 50% and the risk of developing heart diseases by up to 30%.Also Read:",https://t.co/uFRumnDe6w,news

Diabetes diet: Eat flaxseeds to control blood sugar and reduce heart disease risk,"Flaxseeds are one of the best foods when it comes to controlling diabetes.The seeds help manage blood sugar levels, and together with lifestyle changes and medication as required, can help diabetics more easily manage their disease.Also known as linseeds, flaxseeds can improve insulin sensitivity. As they keep blood glucose stable, diabetics should experience less major spikes throughout the day.This blood sugar-lowering effect is due to flaxseeds' insoluble fibre content, reports medical website Healthline.""Research has found that insoluble fibre slows down the release of sugar into the blood and reduces blood sugar,"" it explained.Healthline cites several studies which have found that people with type 2 diabetes who added 10-20 grams of flaxseed powder to their daily diet for at least one month saw reductions of up to 20 per cent in blood sugar levels.Diabetes Daily notes a Canadian study that showed subjects who consumed 50g of flaxseed in meals for four weeks experienced a 27 per cent reduction in blood sugar levels after eating.Flaxseeds can also help prevent diabetes complications like heart disease and stroke, due to the high levels of omega-3 fatty acids.The fatty acids may also aid in the management of other ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's and depression, and may reduce the risk of estrogen-induced breast cancer, as it binds to the estrogen receptors, reports Diabetes Daily.They are a double-whammy when it comes to fighting cancer as they are also a source of lignans, antioxidants which help lower the risk of many cancers.Flaxseeds are an all-round superfood, and are thought to help reduce inflammation and protect the lining of the stomach, making them a good choice for sufferers of Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome.Milled flaxseeds are easier for our bodies to digest than whole seeds, so to get the most benefits, they should be ground into a powder.There are also studies that show flaxseed oil, when taken as a supplement, can reduce total cholesterol and LDL, also known as bad cholesterol.Chia seeds are also beneficial to diabetes sufferers, as they are high in fibre, healthy fats, omega-3s and calcium.Diabetics are also advised to try carb-free, fat-free shirataki 'miracle' noodles, made from the root of the Japanese konjac plant, to keep blood sugar levels under control.They contain a fibre called glucomannan, which forms a protective film on the walls of the intestine and helps to slow down the absorption of glucose and therefore reduce the rise in blood sugar.",https://t.co/qgSD4sEzSr,news
Type 2 diabetes: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?,"Type 2 diabetes management: Are Drumstick or Moringa leaves the best home remedy to lower blood sugar levels?&amp;nbsp New Delhi: You may have heard that drumstick or Moringa oleifera leaves can help maintain blood sugar levels, making it an effective natural remedy to manage diabetes. The plant, often referred to as the miracle tree, has been used for centuries owing to its health benefits. Studies have shown that moringa oleifera contains beneficial antioxidants and bioactive compounds that can help treat and prevent diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, respiratory and skin problems. The moringa tree, which is native to India, is also known by other names such as horseradish tree or ben oil tree.Type 2 diabetes is a major global public health problem that can lead to serious complications if controlled poorly. The condition raises blood glucose (sugar) levels, also known as hyperglycaemia, which may cause damage to the eye, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels. Keeping blood sugar along with body weight under control through a combination of a healthy lifestyle and standard treatment is an important part of diabetes management. Studies show certain herbs and spices blood sugar-lowering properties, and one such being drumstick leaves. Take a look at how this plant can be useful in controlling diabetes.Can Moringa leaves help treat diabetes?Various studies showed effects of moringa leaves on lowering blood sugar levels in diabetes patients and animals, indicating that the plant can be used as a natural way to combat the disease. One study involving 30 women reported that consuming 7 grams of moringa leaf powder everyday for three months helped reduce fasting blood sugar levels 13.5 per cent, on average.Similarly, another small study found that using moringa leaves - about 50 grams - in a meal reduced the rise in blood sugar by some 21 per cent. However, it may be noted that more work is required before making any solid recommendations.Research showed that plant compounds such as isothiocyanates in moringa can help reduce body weight, improve glucose tolerance and insulin signaling in mice fed very high-fat diet (VHFD) supplemented with 5% moringa concentrate (MC). The results also revealed that these mice did not develop fatty liver disease compared to VHFD-fed mice.It is claimed that moringa can help reduce the amount of sugar in the blood, as well as glucose and protein in the urine, which may help treat diabetes.Benefits and risks of Moringa leavesMoringa oleifera is has been used in traditional herbal medicines for many years. The plant is believed to offer many benefits and its uses range from beauty to preventing and curing diseases - such as asthma, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, digestive issues, etc.Moringa leaves are packed with nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are good for your health. However, consuming it is not recommended for pregnant women as moringa may possess anti-fertility qualities.

"How conversational AI, voice and chatbots will transform patient and consumer engagement","The addition of machine learning and deep learning to natural language processing has the potential to transform patient interactions, from calls to health plans to remote monitoring for clinical trials. Few companies understand this better than Orbita, which provides voice and chatbot-powered virtual assistants for voice platforms like Amazon Alexa — the ""voice"" behind Amazon's Echo devices.Although mainstream adoption will take time, the long-anticipated milestone of Amazon's Alexa Skills Kit becoming HIPAA-enabled has new implications and clinical potential for improving patient engagement in remote care and monitoring applications.Orbita SVP Strategy and GM Healthcare Providers Kristi Ebong is taking part in a panel discussion at the MedCity INVEST conference April 23-24 in Chicago called, ""What Can Alexa/Voice Do for Healthcare?"" It will focus on how voice is being used, who the players are and killer applications you may not know about. In addition to Ebong, panelists include John Brownstein, Chief Innovation Officer, Boston Children's Hospital; Tal Wenderow, President &amp; CEO, Beyond Verbal; and Alyssa Jaffee, Vice President, 7wire Ventures will serve as the moderator.Orbita has long believed in the inevitability of virtual assistants finding their way into clinical applications. Amazon's announcement makes this belief a reality and, according to Orbita, opens up a whole new array of applications for Alexa in healthcare. The greatest benefit of voice for healthcare, from Orbita CEO and co-founder Bill Roger's perspective, is reducing friction in patient engagement.Bill Rogers""Healthcare organizations will embrace this technology as a lower-cost complement and even alternative to traditional call centers. Common questions like, 'What about my copay?'can easily be handled by a virtual assistant, which will immediately improve engagement. Every healthcare organization will want to adopt this because it will reduce the friction with consumers and reduce costs."" As of January last year, 39 million people in the U.S. owned a smart speaker — a majority of them are powered by Amazon Alexa. A key reason for this massive adoption is because voice assistants like Alexa have gotten much better at recognizing human speech. These improvements have led to fewer people getting frustrated with voice assistants and more people engaging with this tech. Rogers also regards conversationally-enabled technologies like Alexa as a way to break down barriers that have inhibited seniors from adopting other digital healthcare technologies, like smartphone apps, in more meaningful ways.Explaining aspects of deep learning's impact on natural language processing, Rogers said the voice technology has the power to adapt to different accents and understand different ways of saying the same thing — something that wasn't possible just four to five years ago.Another area that excites Rogers is the potential for voice tech to improve medication adherence. He notes that the first 24 hours of a prescription drug being ordered for patients is critical to determine whether the patient will take the medication and its impact. Did they pick the medication up in the first place? Did they take it, but stopped? Orbita virtual assistants can simultaneously provide value to the patient while gathering important information to help with care plan adherence. Understanding how a patient communicates adverse side effects of a drug, the ability to recognize medication names and their variants, and offering to escalate the patient to a live clinician at the right time are revolutionary capabilities for a virtual assistant to provide in a healthcare journey. ""Chatbots can ask, 'Are you taking your meds? Do you plan to take your Coumadin? I'm sorry you're not feeling well, can I ask you a few questions to try to help?' These are the kind of questions that a physician would ask. If the patient says something costs too much money, then the virtual assistant empowers clinicians with more specific context to address,"" Rogers noted. Another important point is that bots and voice assistants are advancing automation in healthcare. Kristi Ebong""We are going beyond transactional or one-way Q&amp;As, like 'when do I take my medication?', to more conversational interactions that truly engage patients,"" said Kristi Ebong, Orbita SVP Strategy and GM Healthcare Providers. ""There's nothing worse than a data aggregating machine that provides little or no value to the patient. Conversational technology allows us to bring patient-centered value in an operationally efficient way. This is revolutionary.""Lots of technology companies have produced ""skills"" for Alexa that are designed to accomplish different tasks. Orbita has collaborated with several groups to develop these skills, including the Mayo Clinic. Orbita worked with Mayo to produce a First Aid application on Alexa for home use. Ebong noted that their customers are seeing increasing levels of adoption across channels where voice-enabled first aid information is provided — initially Alexa, and more recently Google Assistant, as well as web-based, voice-enabled chatbots. ""This is not a world where if you build it, they will come,"" Ebong noted. ""Meeting the patient where they are as a person and a consumer is ground zero for engagement.""The source of the content for these bots comes from trusted and established content providers who use Orbita to conversationally enable their clinical-grade content. One example includes Mayo Clinic's Global Business Solutions organization, which monetizes health and wellness content developed at Mayo. ""Mayo and organizations like it have high-value content and want affordable, intuitive tools that help them make their content accessible through AI-powered voice and chatbot experiences"", said Ebong.""You can't take two pages of content designed for a website and drop it into a conversational interface like Alexa. It's not that simple. Mayo and others are benefiting from the advanced tooling Orbita provides to streamline the way existing content is used to design, build, manage, and optimize conversational virtual assistants across the enterprise.""She added: ""Context matters. For example, if someone says, 'What are the symptoms of a spider bite?' and then follows up with ""How do I treat it?"", the voice assistant must know that, for the second question, the context is ""spider bite"". Designing contextual conversation flows requires specialized tooling. Orbita has refined our platform in response to what we've learned from Mayo and others about how these tools should be delivered.""Orbita envisions a host of virtual assistant applications for its technology taking hold in the future.""The greatest potential for virtual assistants in healthcare is to seamlessly facilitate omnichannel consumer journeys starting before the patient ever sets foot in the brick-and-mortar clinic to their post-acute transitions of care,"" said Ebong. ""Our customers represent organizations across the healthcare delivery ecosystem including providers, payers, pharma and Fortune 500 companies who are interested in moving the needle across the patient experience.""",https://t.co/vIFXhGHKkg,news

Executive Vitality™: Blood Sugar and Decision Making,"Have you ever been in a meeting and become so hungry that you would agree to just about anything to have the meeting end? Being aware of the things you might say or do when you are hungry can help you avoid sacrificing your composure or making bad decisions.Great leaders ensure they maintain a high level of composure, so it is important to understand that eating habits and blood sugar levels can have an immediate and direct impact on one's decision-making, openness to risk-taking, communication, and ultimately, credibility. And the impacts can affect others' lives.Don't make decisions when you are hungry and do be aware of things you say when you are hungry, I have a towel in my kitchen emblazoned with this message: ""I am sorry for the things I said when I was hungry"" – that statement can be taken as either regret or an apology.From parole decisions and risk-taking to faulty decision-making on the part of organizational leaders, it is not a huge leap. A study of judges found that those who had eaten just before having to decide whether to grant parole or not were more likely to decide in favor of the accused's parole. Right after lunch or a snack, the odds of being granted parole soar to a high of 65% and then as the judge's hunger pangs take hold, plummet to nothing. See Justice Is Served but More So after Lunch-How Food Breaks Sway the Decisions of Judges, Ed Jong, Discover Magazine, April 11, 2011.Other studies have shown that, when people are hungry, they are more likely to make risky decisions. When they are sated, they are more risk-averse. See, National Institutes of Health, Your Decisions Are What You Eat, NIH, May 17, 2013. The potential downsides of hungry decision-making vis-à-vis risk are obvious.You owe it to yourself, your direct reports, colleagues, and ultimately, the organization and its stakeholders to pay attention to your metabolic status. That is a somewhat academic way of saying: ""Take good care of yourself. Eat when you need to. And don't make decisions if your blood sugar is low.""Ways to avoid the hunger trap:Say, ""I need to postpone this decision. I will get back to you.""Say, ""Can we postpone our meeting until after lunch?""Carry calorie-metered snacks with you. A physician I know carries 10 almonds with him and administers them to himself as needed.Don't skip meals. Make your state of mind and body a priority.

Can diabetics eat processed foods? Tips to make healthier food choices for better blood sugar control,"From timesnownews.com/healthProcessed food, as we all know, has been linked to an increased risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure among others. Here's how to make healthier food choices for blood sugar control.New Delhi: Making healthier food choices can help you keep blood sugar levels stable, control body weight and manage diabetes symptoms. Processed food, as we all know, has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure among others. The fact is that a large number of foods, from milk in your breakfast to microwave meals, these days is processed.Many processed foods are high in fat (including unhealthy trans fats), sodium, sugar and calories, but tend to be low in nutrients such as fibre, vitamins, and minerals. They also contain high amounts of artificial colours and flavours, and preservatives. Recently, a study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine found that propionate, a common food additive in bread and other baked goods, may disrupt metabolism and drive insulin resistance in mice and men, fuelling weight gain and diabetes. Processed foods can cause weight gain, diabetesWhy are processed foods especially bad for diabetics?Processed foods can be particularly unhealthy for people with diabetes because they can have a negative effect on blood sugar control. A stated above, research has shown that certain chemicals in processed foods can contribute to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol levels. Eating a diet high in heavily processed foods has been associated with various health problems, including heart disease and cancer.Tips to make healthier food choicesIt may be noted that not all processed foods are created equal, meaning they can range from minimally processed to heavily processed. For instance, some minimally processed food items like pre-cut fruits and vegetables, salad mixes, hard-boiled eggs, milk and juices are quality convenience foods that can be part of a healthy diet for busy people.As a general rule, you should make a habit of avoiding foods containing high amounts of difficult to recognise ingredients. Contrary to their supposed aim, many processed foods may contain a relatively high number of added salt and sugars. Hotdogs, ready meals, fast foods, white bread, white pasta, cakes, pastries, biscuits, buns, margarines, etc, are some of the food items typically recommended to avoid.Try to avoid or minimise your intake of processed foods by focusing more on a whole-food diet prepared and cooked at home. By adding plenty of whole foods, including fresh fruits and veggies, whole grains and beans, to your diet you'll meet your nutritional needs while also improving your blood sugar control. It will also help you lose or maintain weight.If you have diabetes and need help selecting more nutritious, less processed foods for a healthier diet, we suggest you consult with your doctor or a dietician who can assist with meal planning as per your dietary preferences and health goals.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Tips to Optimize Your Blood Sugar Level,"Insulin is essential to staying alive; unfortunately, the vast majority of people have resistance to this essential hormone, speeding up the aging process and contributing to the development of degenerative diseases. Any meal high in grain and sugar carbs typically generates a rapid rise in blood glucose. To compensate, your pancreas secretes more insulin into your bloodstream to lower your blood sugar. Insulin, however, is also very efficient at lowering blood sugar by turning it into fat. The more you secrete, the more fat your body will accumulate. If you consistently consume a high-sugar, high-grain diet, your blood glucose level will be correspondingly high and over time your body becomes desensitized to insulin, requiring more and more of it to get the job done. Eventually, you become insulin resistant and prone to weight gain, and then full-blown diabetic.Prediabetes1 is defined as an elevation in fasting blood glucose between 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and 125 mg/dl. At 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, it formally becomes Type 2 diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 84.1 million American adults — about 1 in 3 — are prediabetic,2,3 and most are unaware of this fact.However, any fasting blood sugar regularly over 90 in my book suggests insulin resistance, and findings by the late Dr. Joseph Kraft — former chairman of the department of clinical pathology and nuclear medicine at Presence Saint Joseph's Hospital, Chicago, and author of ""Diabetes Epidemic and You: Should Everyone Be Tested?"" — suggests a whopping 80% of Americans are insulin resistant, and that's true even if your fasting glucose is normal.4,5The good news is that insulin resistance is one of the easiest health problems to correct. Below I review eight of my top tips for optimizing and maintaining a healthy blood sugar level.Tip No. 1 — Proper Meal TimingIntermittent fasting or compression of your eating window is a powerful approach that facilitates weight loss and helps reduce your risk of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes. In his book ""Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy and Sleep Well Every Night,"" Satchidananda Panda, Ph.D., cites research showing that 90 percent of people eat across a span of 12 hours a day, and many across even longer timespans, which is a clear prescription for metabolic disaster. Intermittent fasting, i.e., the cycling of feast (feeding) and famine (fasting) mimics the eating habits of our ancestors and restores your body to a more natural state that allows a whole host of metabolic benefits to occur.6With regard to insulin resistance, research shows intermittent fasting promotes insulin sensitivity and improves blood sugar management by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates.7While there are a number of different intermittent fasting protocols, my preference is fasting daily for 18 hours and eating all meals within a six-hour window. If you're new to the concept of intermittent fasting, consider starting by skipping breakfast and have your lunch and dinner within a six-hour timeframe, say 11 AM and 5 PM, making sure you stop eating three hours before going to bed. The latter is important, as it helps protect your mitochondrial function. Recent research8,9 shows men who are at risk of Type 2 diabetes can improve their glucose control, thereby lowering that risk, simply by eating all their meals within a nine-hour timeframe — even if they do not implement any other dietary changes. Research10,11 has also shown men who eat supper at least two hours before bedtime have a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer, and women have a 16% lower risk of breast cancer than those who eat dinner closer to bedtime. For more details on why late-night eating is so detrimental, see ""Eating Early Dinner Aids Weight Loss and Lowers Cancer Risk."" When you do eat, focus on healthy protein in moderate amounts and minimize net carbs like pasta and bread, exchanging them for healthy fats like butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and raw nuts. This will help shift you into fat burning mode. On a related side note, when eating, relax and take your time! Research shows rushed eating, which typically occurs when you're stressed, has a significant impact on your blood sugar level. When you become stressed your body also secretes cortisol and glucagon, both of which affect your blood sugar levels as well.12 You can learn more about this in ""How Stress Can Affect Your Blood Sugar Level.""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Click Here &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; AdvertisementTip No. 2 — Monitor Your Blood Sugar LevelAs mentioned, while prediabetes13 is clinically defined as having a fasting blood sugar level between 100 and 125 mg/dl, I strongly believe any blood sugar over 90 mg/dl puts you in the danger zone for insulin resistance. Your blood sugar is measured through a glucose test, of which there are four types:Fasting plasma glucose test — When you fast overnight and take your blood sample in the morning Oral glucose tolerance test — Similar to the fasting blood sugar test, overnight fasting is required for this, and the person's fasting blood sugar level is measured. Afterward, a sugary liquid is provided and the levels are then tested for the next two hours Hemoglobin A1C test — This test checks the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin and will indicate your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months Random plasma glucose test — This makes use of a blood sample that is taken at a random time You could also do 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring, which I've done in the past, although it's pricey and probably not necessary for most people. At the time, I used a Dexcom monitor, which involves inserting a sensor beneath your skin for a week, which takes continuous glucose readings every few minutes. It really helped me fine-tune and evaluate how different foods impacted my glucose levels, and helped me understand the importance of feast-famine cycling. All of that said, for most people, a simple at-home glucose test,14 where you prick your finger and deposit a drop of blood onto a glucose testing strip, will do the job. Ideally, test yourself two to three times a day: first thing in the morning, before your first meal, and a couple of hours after your last meal.Your blood glucose levels will vary throughout the day. According to conventional recommendations, if you are healthy and do not have diabetes, your fasting blood glucose upon waking should be below 100 mg/dL. I recommend aiming for a fasting (when you wake up) level below 90 mg/dL. Before meal time, your glucose level should read between 70 to 99 mg/dL. After meals — or what's called ""postprandial"" and is usually taken two hours after eating — the level should be below 140 mg/dL.There are two measurements used for blood sugar levels. In the U.S., the measurement is in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). In the U.K. and Canada, the measurement for blood sugar is in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). To convert to mg/dL, multiply the amount by 18. For example, if a person in the U.K. says that their blood glucose result is 7 mmol/L, in the U.S. it's read as 126 mg/dL.Tip No. 3 — Monitor Your Blood KetonesAnother valuable test is the blood ketone test, which will tell you whether you're in nutritional ketosis or not. I recommend starting your intermittent fasting routine and monitoring your blood ketones as you go along. The KetoCoachX monitor15 is currently one of the best and least expensive ketone monitors on the market.You're in nutritional ketosis once your blood ketone level is above 0.3 to 0.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).16 Ideally, perform the test first thing in the morning while still in a fasted state (i.e., before ingesting anything). Having a fasting ketone level above 1 mmol/L is a sign you're in deep ketosis. Once your fasting ketones are greater than 0.3 mmol/L, then you can start incorporating partial fasting as described in my book, ""KetoFast: Rejuvenate Your Health With a Step-by-Step Guide to Timing Your Ketogenic Meals."" The partial fasting regimen described in ""KetoFast"" essentially mimics ancestral eating patterns, allowing your body to work optimally by allowing for periods of breakdown and cleanout, and periods of rebuilding and rejuvenation.Among the many health benefits of cyclical fasting is improved circulating glucose and lipid levels.17 For a summary of my KetoFast protocol, see ""Avoid the Dark Side of Fasting and Ketosis With KetoFasting.""Tip No. 4 — Radically Limit Net Carbs Until You Are Metabolically FlexibleAlong with intermittent fasting, you'll also want to adopt a cyclical ketogenic diet, which involves radically limiting carbs (replacing them with healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein) until you're close to or at your ideal weight. As with intermittent fasting, this will allow your body to start using fat as its primary fuel rather than carbohydrates. Twenty grams of carbs a day is on the low end of what's typically recommended to maintain nutritional ketosis, although some may be able to eat up to 50 grams a day and still maintain a ketogenic state. The only way you'll know how many total carbs, fiber and net carbs you eat is to keep a food diary. The simplest way of doing this is to use an online nutrition tracker. Also remember you need to measure your ketones to determine if and when you're in nutritional ketosis. One of the primary reasons you develop insulin resistance is because you're eating too many net carbs (total carbs minus fiber), too much protein and too little healthy fat. For optimal health, your body must be able to burn fat for fuel, and this is an ability that is lost when you consume too many net carbs on a daily basis.When your body is able to burn fat for fuel, your liver creates ketones (water-soluble fats) that not only improve your glucose metabolism18 but also burn far more efficiently than carbs, thus lowering inflammation by creating fewer damaging reactive oxygen species and secondary free radicals. If your ketones are above 0.3 mmol/L, as described in the section above, you can start increasing the amount of healthy carbs back into your diet and start cyclical ketosis.To get you started, see my previous article, ""Ketogenic Diet: A Beginner's Ultimate Guide to Keto."" A far more detailed exposition on nutritional ketosis and how to implement a cyclical ketogenic diet can be found in my book, ""Fat for Fuel,"" which is the prequel to ""KetoFast.""Tip No. 5 — Increase Healthy Fats A key to making nutritional ketosis work is to replace the lost carbs with healthy fats, and knowing which fats are healthy and which ones are not is a crucial distinction here. Most people will need 60 to 85 percent of daily calories in the form of fat, but not all fats qualify. Fats to steer clear of are industrially processed vegetable oils, found in most processed foods and restaurant foods. Polyunsaturated fat found in processed vegetable oils is not harmful in and of itself, but becomes so if and when you eat too much of it, and/or when the oils degrade, which occurs during refining, processing and heating (cooking). Not only can they form trans fats if heated high enough, but they can also form cyclic aldehydes, which are even more harmful. For a run-down of the dangers associated with processed vegetable oils, see ""Top 13 Reasons to Replace Dangerous Oils With Healthy Fats."" For cooking, healthy alternatives include coconut oil, grass fed raw organic butter, organic ghee, lard, tallow and olive oil. For general eating, foods high in healthy fats include avocado, olives, coconut, raw nuts such as macadamia and pecans, seeds such as black sesame, cumin, pumpkin and hemp seeds, raw cacao butter and organic pastured egg yolks. Dairy fats found in butter, cheese and yogurt have been shown to lower your diabetes risk specifically. MCT oil is another healthy fat — just be sure to avoid taking it during partial fasting days once you've started KetoFasting, as exogenous ketones will inhibit autophagy. Tip No. 6 — Drink Plenty of Clean Pure Water Next, be sure to drink plenty of clean, purified water. Organic black coffee (meaning no milk or sugar) and tea are other healthy choices. Steer clear of all sweetened beverages, including ""diet"" drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners and fruit juices. As for how much water you need, your best bet is to use thirst and the color of your urine as a guide, along with frequency of urination.Thirst — Simply using thirst as a guide to how much water you need to drink is a simple way to help ensure your individual needs are met, day by dayColor — If your urine is a deep, dark yellow, then you are likely not drinking enough water. Light straw-colored urine is typically a sign of sufficient water intakeFrequency of urination — If your urine is scant or if you haven't urinated in many hours, that too is an indication that you're not drinking enough. Based on the results from a few different studies, a healthy person urinates on average about seven or eight times a day Tip No. 7 — Eat More Nuts and Seeds In addition to being a good source of healthy fats, nuts and seeds are also an excellent source of magnesium, which many are deficient in. Lack of magnesium may raise your risk of insulin resistance as it plays an important role in carbohydrate and glucose metabolism. Magnesium helps your body metabolize carbs and glucose properly. As noted by Today's Dietician:19""Epidemiologic data20,21 suggest that for every 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreases by approximately 15%. The few clinical studies22,23 showing efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity with magnesium supplementation have used doses between 300 and 365 mg/day."" Some of the most magnesium-rich seeds include sunflower, black sesame, black cumin, pumpkin and chia seeds. Among these, black cumin (nigella sativa) deserves special mention, as studies have shown it can help prevent both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In one study, black cumin improved glucose tolerance as efficiently as metformin.24 As a source of healthy fats, my preferences go to macadamias, pecans and walnuts, as they are high in fat while being lower in protein. Tip No. 8 — Properly Prescribed ExerciseLast but not least, you need exercise, focusing more on strength/resistance training than cardio. Research25 published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise found even a single session of moderate exercise can improve the way your body regulates glucose and reduces postprandial glucose spikes, and several studies have demonstrated the benefits of strength training for diabetes specifically.Among them is a 2017 study,26 which found strength training lowered women's risk of Type 2 diabetes by 30%. Adding aerobic exercise on top of it reduced the risk even further. Participants who performed at least 120 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, along with some form of strength training, had a 65% lower risk for Type 2 diabetes than those who did neither.Research27 published in April 2019 found a link between muscular strength and Type 2 diabetes incidence. People with mid-level muscular strength, measured using leg and bench press tests, had a 32% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to weaker cohorts, irrespective of cardiorespiratory fitness. No significant association between diabetes and upper level muscle strength was observed, however. A third example of this kind of research was published in BioMed Research International in 2013.28 This review also investigated the mechanisms of how exercise lowers your risk of diabetes. One way by which strength training improves your glucose metabolism is by increasing glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle.GLUT4 translocation occurs as a result of muscle contraction,29 and is required for proper regulation of glucose uptake in your muscles. Strength training increases your insulin sensitivity, as lean muscle is highly sensitive to insulin,30 which helps restore metabolic flexibility.By using insulin more efficiently, your body also ends up using more glucose, leaving less to circulate in your bloodstream — hence the improvements in glucose control.31,32 ""Increased energy expenditure and excess postexercise oxygen consumption in response to resistance training may be other beneficial effects,"" the review paper33 notes.High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has also been shown to effectively reduce your risk for diabetes. In one such study,34 older overweight Type 2 diabetics improved their glucose regulation in just six HIIT sessions done over the course of two weeks.Participants performed 10 bouts of 60-second cycling at 90 percent of their maximum heart rate, interspersed with 60 seconds of rest (total time spent exercising was one hour per week). Overall, the average 24-hour blood glucose concentration was reduced from 7.6 mmol/L (± 1.0) to 6.6 mmol/L (± 0.7) following the exercise.According to the authors, ""Our findings indicate that low-volume HIIT can rapidly improve glucose control and induce adaptations in skeletal muscle that are linked to improved metabolic health in patients with Type 2 diabetes.""",https://t.co/FUt1sKBKFZ,news
Kind Snacks - Because All Women Need a Healthy Snack in Their Purse,"If you've been reading my blog for a while you probably know I promote eating ""real food.""

Diabetes diet: Eat flaxseeds to control blood sugar and reduce heart disease risk,"Flaxseeds are one of the best foods when it comes to controlling diabetes.The seeds help manage blood sugar levels, and together with lifestyle changes and medication as required, can help diabetics more easily manage their disease.Also known as linseeds, flaxseeds can improve insulin sensitivity. As they keep blood glucose stable, diabetics should experience less major spikes throughout the day.This blood sugar-lowering effect is due to flaxseeds' insoluble fibre content, reports medical website Healthline.""Research has found that insoluble fibre slows down the release of sugar into the blood and reduces blood sugar,"" it explained.Healthline cites several studies which have found that people with type 2 diabetes who added 10-20 grams of flaxseed powder to their daily diet for at least one month saw reductions of up to 20 per cent in blood sugar levels.Diabetes Daily notes a Canadian study that showed subjects who consumed 50g of flaxseed in meals for four weeks experienced a 27 per cent reduction in blood sugar levels after eating.Flaxseeds can also help prevent diabetes complications like heart disease and stroke, due to the high levels of omega-3 fatty acids.The fatty acids may also aid in the management of other ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's and depression, and may reduce the risk of estrogen-induced breast cancer, as it binds to the estrogen receptors, reports Diabetes Daily.They are a double-whammy when it comes to fighting cancer as they are also a source of lignans, antioxidants which help lower the risk of many cancers.Flaxseeds are an all-round superfood, and are thought to help reduce inflammation and protect the lining of the stomach, making them a good choice for sufferers of Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome.Milled flaxseeds are easier for our bodies to digest than whole seeds, so to get the most benefits, they should be ground into a powder.There are also studies that show flaxseed oil, when taken as a supplement, can reduce total cholesterol and LDL, also known as bad cholesterol.Chia seeds are also beneficial to diabetes sufferers, as they are high in fibre, healthy fats, omega-3s and calcium.Diabetics are also advised to try carb-free, fat-free shirataki 'miracle' noodles, made from the root of the Japanese konjac plant, to keep blood sugar levels under control.They contain a fibre called glucomannan, which forms a protective film on the walls of the intestine and helps to slow down the absorption of glucose and therefore reduce the rise in blood sugar.",https://t.co/TpiGITNsgB,news
"Metformin Trumps Diet, Exercise for Sustained Weight Loss, Study Finds","Doctors' routine recommendations for avoiding type 2 diabetes in the face of a prediabetes diagnosis is to lose weight by following a nutritious diet and exercising — and in some cases taking medication. But a new study, published in April 2019 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, has suggested that the popular blood sugar–lowering drug Glucophage (metformin) alone may help people with prediabetes sustain their weight loss and lower their risk for type 2 diabetes.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Diabetes Prevention Program, losing 5 to 10 percent of your weight in six months can help improve blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol.In the study, among overweight and obese people with prediabetes who achieved 5 percent or more weight loss initially, the percentage who kept the weight off over time was greater among those taking metformin — a medication that helps control high blood sugar and can aid weight loss — than those who made intensive lifestyle changes.""We were surprised by the resilience of the metformin group in not regaining weight they lost in the first year,"" says study author Kishore Gadde, MD, a professor in heart disease prevention at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""While there was individual variability, those assigned to receive metformin collectively performed very well in the long term, especially in the last 10 years of the 15-year follow-up.""Although the weight loss mechanism behind metformin is unclear, the Mayo Clinic notes that the drug seems to reduce hunger, and two of the drug's side effects — diarrhea and upset stomach — could also reduce how much someone eats.The CDC estimates that 100 million American adults have prediabetes or diabetes. The agency estimates that 30.3 million Americans have diabetes, with 90 to 95 percent of those cases type 2. Of the total with diabetes, 7.2 million are undiagnosed. Meanwhile, 4 in 10 American adults have obesity, according to the CDC, and extra weight not only raises the risk of type 2 diabetes but also heart disease and some types of cancer.RELATED: Does Metformin Cause Weight Loss? What to Know Before You Take ItCould Metformin Be a Possible Lasting Solution for Weight Control?Dr. Gadde and his fellow investigators tracked 3,234 people who had obesity or were overweight, and had elevated blood sugar levels. Researchers randomly selected them to receive either metformin, a placebo, or an intensive diet and exercise program.Those in the lifestyle intervention group completed 16 sessions where they learned how to eat healthful foods, reduce their calorie and fat intake, and develop an exercise regimen incorporating 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as walking, per week.During the first year, the lifestyle intervention patients lost the most weight. Nearly 63 percent in this group lost at least 5 percent of their weight in the first year compared with 28.5 percent in the metformin group and 13.4 percent in the placebo group.Yet investigators observed that the highest proportion of those who kept pounds off after 6 to 15 years was in the metformin group. The percentage who maintained more than 5 percent weight loss was 56 percent in the metformin group versus 43 percent in the lifestyle group and 42 percent in the placebo arm.RELATED: Losing This Much Weight May Put Type 2 Diabetes in Remission, Study SuggestsWhy Keeping Lost Weight off for Good Tends to Be So ChallengingKevin M. Pantalone, DO, an endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic in Twinsburg, Ohio, and the director of clinical research of Cleveland Clinic's Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute, suspects that the metformin participants had better long-term outcomes than the lifestyle group because taking daily pills may be easier to continue over time compared with dramatic dietary and exercise changes.""Keeping patients engaged in lifestyle modifications, or other weight loss efforts in general, is challenging in the long term, as enthusiasm wanes, or because the weight loss invariably hits a plateau, and patients can become frustrated and disengage as a result,"" says Dr. Pantalone, who was not involved in the study.He believes that the simultaneous use of medication and lifestyle interventions may produce the best results in the long run.""Addressing weight loss in the short term and the long term would likely best be accomplished by leveraging as many modalities as possible, and addressing as many variables as possible,"" says Pantalone. ""The current follow-up observational report did not include a combined intensive lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin intervention group, so we do not know whether the two interventions are additive or synergistic for either initial weight loss or for the long-term maintenance of weight loss.""RELATED: 6 Foolproof Ways to Lose Weight for Diabetes and Heart HealthWeighing the Limitations of the Analysis on Metformin and Weight LossA corresponding editorial, also published in April 2019 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, recognized additional limitations and factors to consider in evaluating the results. While the percentage who maintained weight loss at year 15 was greater in the metformin takers, the hard numbers were bigger for the lifestyle intervention participants — 373 versus 172 in the metformin group.Furthermore, the number of participants in the ILS and placebo groups who received metformin increased over time, wrote editorial authors Leslie Katzel, MD, PhD, and John Sorkin, MD, PhD, with the Baltimore VA Medical Center Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center and University of Maryland School of Medicine. Also the metformin and placebo groups received some educational training in exercise and dietary advice.Gadde says the study began with participants who were at risk of developing diabetes, so the data cannot be directly applied to treatment of patients with diabetes.""Nevertheless, when taken together with an enormous amount of data gathered from studies of patients with diabetes, our study data is consistent in that one of the benefits of metformin is a small degree of long-term weight loss,"" says Gadde.In future studies, researchers would like to investigate whether metformin can help maintain weight loss that is initially achieved with diet, weight loss drugs, or bariatric surgery. One question they'd address, for example, is whether people lose weight initially with low-calorie diets and then take metformin for maintaining that weight loss for several years.No matter what the approach, maintaining a healthy weight is an ongoing and challenging process.""Obesity is a chronic disease,"" says Pantalone, ""and it must be managed continuously — just as we manage high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol — in order to help patients lose weight and maintain that weight loss moving forward.""RELATED: 21 Tips for Weight Loss That Actually Work",https://t.co/d3sT7jcEjr,news
"Diabetes: Don't walk barefoot, check blood sugar in heat","Diabetes: Don't walk barefoot, check blood sugar in heat April 24, 2019 122 Dr Pradeep Gadge DTMT NetworkManaging diabetes is more challenging in hot and humid conditions. Doctors have emphasized that there is a need for diabetes patients to be more cautious in the summer season. They said that extreme heat in summers affects blood sugar levels. It makes an individual sweat profusely, and he may become dehydrated, which leads to a rise in sugar levels.It is like a vicious cycle when one becomes dehydrated and the blood sugar levels rise. This can lead to frequent urination, which then leads to further dehydration and even higher blood sugar levels.Dr Pradeep Gadge, Diabetologist, Gadge Diabetes Centre, Mumbai, has advised that patients affected with diabetes need to drink plenty of fluids in the heat as they tend to get dehydrated easily.Dr Gadge points out that when the diabetes affected patient is dehydrated, he has high concentrations of blood sugar because less blood flows through his kidneys. With less blood, his kidneys don't work as efficiently to clear out any excess blood sugar via urine. So, there is need to increase intake of fluids in hot weather.Dr Gadge asserts that there is need for protective medication as high summer temperatures can affect diabetes medications, glucose meter, and diabetes test strips. When it's hot outside, it's easy for insulin and other drugs to become degraded.The patient should check his blood sugar levels frequently as high temperatures can change how his body uses insulin. People may need to test their blood sugar more often and adjust their insulin dosage.Dr Gadge said that one should avoid walking barefoot, especially if he has nerve damage that reduces the ability to feel sharp objects and hot surfaces. He might hurt himself and not realize it. Wearing protective shoes is advisable.""Check your feet every day for cuts and other injuries. Also, look for a scaly rash on your feet and white spots between your toes, which could be athlete's foot. Sweaty feet make you more likely to get athlete's foot and other fungal infections. Keep your feet dry,"" explains Dr Gadge. Share this Post:",https://t.co/xvsbSMdxIp,news
Whole Fruits Shown to Balance Blood Sugar & Weight,"Many studies have reported undesirable effects on blood sugar and weight gain from consuming excess fructose. (6) This may be why many Paleo experts have condemned fruit—perhaps before giving it a fair trial?Here's where the mistake lies: Most of these studies were done on either high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or concentrated fruit juices, and not whole fruits.Whole fruits, on the other hand, are linked to weight loss AND lower blood sugar!The results of a recent study in China that followed nearly 500,000 people for around 7 years showed that fruit actually lowers the risk of diabetes. (1) Researchers found that the population that ate the most fruit saw a 2 percent reduction in diabetes risk. In those who ate more fruit and were already diagnosed as diabetic, they saw an almost 2 percent reduction in mortality. This was a striking result because fruits are restricted for diabetics in most parts of Asia.In a recent meta-analysis where three studies on fruits were evaluated, greater consumption of certain whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes and apples, is associated with a significantly LOWER risk of type 2 diabetes.In the same study, they found that the regular consumption of fruit juice was associated with a HIGHER risk of type 2 diabetes. (2)Eat Whole Fruits to Lose WeightFruit contains large amounts of simple sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose, etc.), which are well-known to induce obesity. Considering the amount of simple sugars found in fruit, it is reasonable to expect that their consumption might contribute to weight gain rather than weight reduction. However, epidemiological research has consistently shown that most types of fruit have anti-obesity effects and, once again, this only applies to whole fruits and NOT fruit juices, dried fruit, etc. (3)Ayurvedic Fruit PasteIn one study, the Ayurvedic superfood, chyawanprash – which is derived mainly from the amla fruit or amalaki (Emblica officinalis) – was studied alongside supplementation of vitamin C.Ten normal healthy adult male volunteers (age 20-32 years) participated in the 16-week study. They were placed randomly in either a chyawanprash group or vitamin C group. Those in the chyawanprash group received about a tablespoon of chyawanprash per day, while those in the vitamin C group received 500mg of vitamin C per day.amla berriesBoth groups were supplemented for 8 weeks during the study and then given no supplements for the next 8 weeks. For evaluation purposes, both groups were given an oral glucose tolerance test and lipoprotein profile performed at 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks.At 8 weeks in the chyawanprash supplemented group, the researchers observed significant changes in both the blood sugar AND cholesterol results compared to the results of week 0. (5)At 8 week in the vitamin C supplemented group, the researchers observed significant change in ONLY their LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios compared to the results of week 0.Ayurvedic Fruit-Eating RulesHave fruit as a meal, separate from other foods, during the warmer months of the year.Have fruit as a snack when a meal was not enough.Save the less sweet fruits to have with other foods. &gt;&gt;&gt; See a Sugar Content of Fruit chart hereSave the sweeter fruits to have as a meal, separate from other foods. &gt;&gt;&gt; See a Sugar Content of Fruit chart here",https://t.co/ZqNtlPfPY3,news
University of Texas finds strong link to elevated blood sugar and fibromyalgia pain in metformin trial,"Researchers led by a team from The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston were able to almost completely eliminate pain in fibromyalgia patients with a medication that targets insulin resistance ( metformin ), showing a link to elevated blood sugars and the disease.The study consisted of two groups, one on the standard treatment that involves norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (amitriptyline, duloxetine or milnacipran) and 'membrane stabilizing agents' (gabapentin or pregabalin), and another group that was given the standard treatment plus metformin.The results were dramatic:( the I-NPRS was the initial pain assessment. ST-NPRS was the standard treatment group. M-NPRS was the standard treatment + metformin group )Researchers noted a high degree of correlation to hba1c values and fibromyalgia severity when adjusting or age and gender. Of note, a majority of the patients were hovering in the pre-diabetic range of hba1c:From the paper:In view of the substantive research efforts involved in FM, including those from the pharmaceutical industry, we were puzzled that prior investigations had overlooked these simple findings. The main reason for this oversight is that many patients with FM show HbA1c values currently considered to be within the normal range; however, this is the first study to analyze the data in an age-stratified manner. This is important, considering the effect of aging on HbA1c levels [19]. Therefore, a value of 5.5%, for example (considered ""normal"" by current criteria), may not be so in many young subjects. An additional reason for having missed this association may be as follows: prior studies have established an association between FM and small fiber neuropathy [17, 18]. Although IR is a frequent cause of small fiber neuropathy, work up of this disorder by the investigators of these studies did not include evaluation of HbA1c levels. Instead, other methods were used in some studies [i.e., oral glucose tolerance tests; for example, see [17]]. Our data, if confirmed, may explain not only mechanisms germane to central pain in FM but also, the association between this disorder and small fiber neuropathy. Our take..In type 2 diabetes, elevated blood sugar causes systemic inflammation and eventual destruction of nerves (neuropathy) and blood vessels, as well of a host of other negative effects. Type 2 diabetes is the inability of the insulin to divert excess blood sugar, due to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance often forms when the body has perpetually elevated insulin levels, and starts to become numb to insulin's signal.It is no surprise to us that fibromyalgia and diabetes share many characteristics – systemic inflammation of nerves and blood vessels induced by excess blood sugar, as well as many other issues diabetics experience, such as brain fog and joint pain.

And there is good reason for itâ€""bread (even whole grain bread) contains gluten, and can contribute to inflammation in the body–especially the gut, and even the healthier 'whole grain' versions of bread can increase the blood sugar levels dramatically… In fact, some blood sugar tests have shown that 2 slices of ""whole wheat"" bread can spike blood sugar as high as an equivalent amount of calories of pure table sugar.Gluten free bread can often beÂ just as bad or worse, with its highly refined grains and starches. However, one particular type of bread is far healthier and easier to digest and it's been around for centuries…Sourdough bread is made in an entirely different way than commercially prepared breads and gluten free breads. Sourdough is a fermented bread, and the fermentation processÂ makes it easier to digest and less likely to spike blood sugar levels, while also making the gluten in sourdough bread easier to digest than standard white, wheat, or multigrain breads.Sourdough bread is actually one of the oldest ways of baking bread, and is thought to to have been prepared and baked in ancient Egypt around 1500 BC. Â Sourdough bread is still hugely popular in the Mediterranean and Middle East, as well as the San Francisco area of the United States. Â (Mike's note: Â While on a trip in France last year, we noticed that almost every restaurant served sourdough bread instead of regular non-fermented bread, and with grass-fed butter… once again, the French doÂ it right in terms of quality of food and nutrition)Most breads use baker's yeast to help the dough rise, but traditional sourdough recipes use 'wild yeast' and lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria are the same type of beneficial bacteria found in fermented foods such as yogurt, pickles, kombucha, sauerkraut and kimchi.Sourdough uses a 'starter' made of fermented wild yeast, lactic acid bacteria, flour and water. The sourdough starter begins to ferment the sugars in the dough, changing the molecular structure, and breaking down its components, creating lactic acid and lactobacilli.More Nutrition in Every SlicePhytic acid is a substance in nuts, seeds and grains. Phytic acid or phytates are considered 'anti-nutrients' because they bind with minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc, making them unusable in the body, creating mineral deficiencies in those who eat large quantities of nuts, seeds and grains. This is especially true for vegetarians and vegans. It also binds with niacin, creating a B-vitamin deficiency called pellagra, which is especially noticeable in developing countries.Probiotic lactobacilli contains the enzyme phytase, which breaks down phytic acid, making the sourdough bread easier to digest, and rendering the nutrients and minerals easier to utilize in the body.Â This study shows sourdough bread fermentation reduces the phytate content by 24-50% over conventional yeast bread.Â Studies show that the lactic acid in sourdough can actually release more antioxidants during fermentation. Sourdough fermentation also tends to increase the folate levels in the bread as well.Because of its natural fermentation, sourdough also possesses a variety of bioavailable nutrients. It is rich in B vitamins, B1, B6, B12, folate, thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, vitamin E, selenium, iron, manganese, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and potassium, along with its well balanced proteins and fatty acids. By contrast, many commercially prepared breads are so low in nutrients, that less-than-desirable synthetic vitaminsÂ are added back in, and those are more poorly absorbed by us.Easier to Digest Even if Gluten-IntolerantMany people are gluten sensitive or gluten intolerant. This means they are sensitive to the gluten molecule or protein in most breads. When sourdough bread is fermented, the fermentation process helps to dissolve the proteins and peptide bonds in the gluten. The enzymes in the bread help dissolve albumin, globulin, prolamin, and glutalin. These enzymes also produce a type of alcohol that will dissolve water-insoluble protein bonds. This breaking down of these proteins means that gluten sensitive people are often able to eat sourdough bread without a reaction. While gluten tolerance varies from person to person, those with true celiac disease should still avoid sourdough bread if it's made from wheat or rye. Gluten-free sourdough is an option however, for those who are extremely sensitive to gluten.Keep in mind though, that not all sourdough bread is made the same way, and depending on how long it ferments, and how long it is kneaded, can make the difference between a tummy ache from gluten and no tummy ache.[Cat's note: Â I have genuine celiac disease and am pretty sensitive, but when traveling overseas, I have found I have been able to eat bread from Peru, some parts of Europe and Nepal, so I may have to try this out and see what happens]. Better Blood Sugar ControlOne of the big negatives about eating regular bread, even the 'whole wheat' or 'whole grain' variety, is the blood sugar effects. People are often shocked to hear that whole wheat bread often increases blood sugar to as high of a level, or even higher level than pure sugarÂ does. In fact, eating two slices of whole wheat bread is not too different than eating a candy bar in terms of blood sugar impact!The good news is that sourdough bread may have a better effect on blood sugar and insulin levels than whole wheat bread, though the reason for this is not yet fully understood. Researchers theorize that the fermentation process must alter the carbohydrate molecules, which in turn slows down the speed at which the sugars enter the bloodstream. Several studies compared the glucose response of participants with sourdough bread and regular bread with baker's yeast. Participants showed lower blood sugar and insulin response overall with the sourdough bread.Make Your Own SourdoughMuch of the sourdough you buy in grocery stores in the US is not genuine sourdough and therefore will not contain the nutrient benefits that real sourdough contains. Â However, high quality restaurants and bakeries will often have legitimate genuine sourdough. Â You can also easily make your own sourdough at home, but remember it takes time to produce a high quality sourdough starter.Once you have your starter, you 'feed' it daily and let it grow for 5-7 days. Do not rush this process.Â Here are a few sourdough bread recipes from various websites:Enjoy your sourdough bread with a generous hunk of grass fed butter and raw honey! Now, that's good eatin'!Speaking of bread…Did you know that traditional grain-based bread contains a compound that is the #1 greatest danger in your diet.Studies show that this compound (and I am not talking about ""gluten) is toxic to your heart and blood vessels… toxic to your immune system… and toxic to your nerves and brain.And if that's not enough…This hidden compound also makes it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to burn fat and lose weight!The great news is that you can still have your BREAD… and be well too!Plus, this unique type of bread shown on that page actually HELPS your body burn MORE fat than eating vegetables (it actually triggers a fat-burning hormonal environment in your body)Discover the secret to the world's healthiest bread… a secret that took my good friend Kelley Herring 10 years to master!Here's to enjoying delicious bread again, while simultaneously putting your body in a fat-burning state (win-win!) …This is PERFECT for diabetics too, since this special type of bread has almost ZERO impact on blood sugar.References:",https://t.co/vWrhrtowZt,news
Fake news and Type 2 diabetes: it's time to tackle misinformation on lifestyle,"People with diabetes can't always tell fact from fiction when it comes to dietary guidance. And with the internet awash with conflicting sources of information on diet, exercise and glycaemic control, it's easy to see why. In the space of just two weeks in 2018, the Daily Express alone published or republished 17 clickbait headlines on diabetes, often misleading, and designed to appeal to readers' fears about their health.Here are a couple of them:Of course, that's not to understate the public health crisis currently facing the nation – a recent estimate by Diabetes UK suggested a record 12.3 million people are now at elevated risk of developing Type 2. But we urgently need to stem this flow of misinformation.Even the broadsheets can be prone to misrepresenting scientific evidence. The Guardian, for example, ran in August with the headline ""No healthy level of alcohol consumption, says major study"". That referred to a major mata-analysis of 694 studies to work out how common drinking was, and a further 592 that assessed the health risks, accounting for a total 28 million people and published in The Lancet.The researchers found that for each extra drink consumed in a day, the harm increased, and that the lowest level of harm was zero drinks – the basis of the Guardian's headline. It isn't, however, that simple.The study showed that 918 in 100,000 people who consume one drink a day can expect to experience an alcohol-related health issue. Yet 914 of those people will experience such a health issue no matter what, meaning only four in 100,000 do so as a direct result of consuming one drink a day(1). The study also did not account for other factors that may have been the actual cause of harm – drinkers are more likely be poorer and to smoke, for example.Again, this is not to understate the risks; it's beyond doubt that drinking is detrimental to health. The point, however, is that misleading headlines create a widespread lack of understanding what constitutes an achievable, healthy lifestyle – with significant implications for public health.Many people are unaware, for example, that consuming carbs, not fats, is what typically leads to weight gain. Another common misconception is that Type 2 diabetes is a sign of having eaten too many sweets, rather than too much bread and pasta.Peer support groups for diabetes can be tenuous in reliability too. A 2011 study of health social networks, published in the Journal of the American Medical Infomatics Association, found that only 50% were aligned with clinical practice recommendations (n=10).Many people naturally turn to Dr Google for information on diet, but the sheer volume of conflicting information found in a five minute search would be enough to overwhelm anybody. Healthcare professionals may have time only to hand their patients a stack of leaflets on lifestyle, and while the NHS website goes some way to helping, there's more that could be done.We must counter this deluge of misinformation by providing more people with clear, evidence-based guidance and support. If we don't, there's only one likely outcome: incidences of diabetes will continue to rise and with them, the strain on health economies across the nation.1: New York Times, 28 August: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/upshot/alcohol-health-risks-study-worry.html",https://t.co/QksuG95zG1,news
Type 2 diabetes: Lower your blood sugar by adding more of this bean to your diet,"Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by making lifestyle changes, including improving your diet. As well as cutting down on sugar and other unhealthy foods, adding more of other foods into your diet may also help to manage blood sugar levels. According to dietitian Juliette Kellow, one type of food that is beneficial to people with diabetes is pulses. Pulses are the dried seeds of legume plants, such as beans, chickpeas, lentils and dried peas, and kidney beans could be of particular significance.""Kidney beans are the star of the pulse world for their high fibre content, which is important for weight management and those with type 2 diabetes, plus they're rich in antioxidants,"" said Kellow.Although kidney beans are a standout performer, all types of pulses have benefits which may help to improve blood sugar levels, notes the dietitian.In one study, it was found regularly consuming large portions of pulses improved blood sugar control, making them ideal for people with type 2 diabetes.The study involved participants eating 200g, or 7oz, portions of pulses five times a week.Another large study found women who ate the highest, compared with the lowest, amounts of pulses reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by nearly a quarter.Other types of beans which fall into the pulses family include haricot beans, black-eyed beans and black beans.Kellow advises all people to include pulses in their diets, whether they have diabetes or not.Studies show a daily serving of 80g, or 3oz, of pulses offer the best health benefits, and the dietitian recommends choosing a variety of pulses to ensure a range of nutrients.All beans are nutrient rich, but canned varieties are a little less so than dried versions. If using canned pulses, choose those in water without added sugar or salt.""Good intakes of pulses are linked to a host of health benefits, reducing the risk of many age-related problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes,"" said Kellow.""They're also a great weight-loss food, and an excellent source of nutrients for all.""Type 2 diabetes happens in people whose bodies don't produce enough insulin, or the insulin produced is rejected by the body's cells.Insulin is needed to control the level of sugar in the blood and transfer it to the cells to be turned into energy.If insulin is unable to do this, too much sugar will remain in the blood, which can lead to serious health complications with the heart, kidneys, nerves, eyes and feet.As well as improving your diet, type 2 diabetes can be managed by exercising regularly, not smoking and limiting alcohol intake.Weight management is important for people with type 2 diabetes as people who are overweight are more likely to develop the condition and also more likely to suffer from the associated complications.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.",https://t.co/dyR9qmQqW7,news
What Is the Best Time of Day to Exercise to Improve Blood Sugar Levels?,"What Is the Best Time of Day to Exercise to Improve Blood Sugar Levels? on February 5, 2019 at 8:36 am In my last blog I wrote briefly about why it's important for all of us to try to maintain relatively stable blood sugar levels. This goal is especially relevant to people who have diabetes and hope to minimize the risk of developing problems with their cardiovascular systems, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.Like diet and sleep, physical activity is a key determinant of how blood sugar fluctuates each day. Researchers studying how nutrition affects blood sugar regulation have generally focused on what to eat and how much to eat. Similarly, scientists exploring whether physical activity influences blood sugar control have mostly fixated on exercise modality and workload. Meanwhile, research on the importance of the time of day of diet and physical activity interventions has largely been neglected.Fortunately, this is changing. Timing's time has come, and some of the best scientists are starting to identify how critical when we eat and when we move might be for our health. So, I was very pleased to see a group of scientists led by Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm recently publish work on this topic. Their findings are especially relevant to those of us who wish to improve our blood sugar regulation. What is the best time of day to exercise to improve blood sugar regulation in people who have type-two diabetes?There's a strong body of evidence showing that high-intensity interval training (HIIT*) is a time-efficient and safe way to improve numerous aspects of cardiometabolic health, including blood sugar regulation. However, we haven't known much about whether it's better for people intent on improving their blood sugar regulation to do HIIT in the morning or afternoon. To address this gap in our knowledge, here's what the researchers did:Eleven middle-aged men who have type-two diabetes that they manage through diet and/or using metformin took part. They underwent two, two-week periods of HIIT with two-weeks of no training between.During both training periods, the men did three HIIT sessions per week (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). The HIIT sessions proceeded as follows: After a seven-minute warm up, the participants did six repetitions of one minute of cycling at the highest load at which they could pedal at 75 RPM. Between repetitions, the men actively recovered by cycling at 75 RPM with minimal added load.Now, the only difference between the training periods was that whereas in one of the periods the participants did the HIIT in the morning (at 8 AM), in the other they did the HIIT in the afternoon (at 4 PM).To track their blood sugar, the men wore continuous glucose monitors. The researchers used data from the monitors to calculate participants' average blood sugar levels every hour.So, did the timing of HIIT have any effects? Advantage afternoon HIITOnly afternoon HIIT reduced blood sugar levels on exercise days. Morning HIIT actually increased blood sugar levels on exercise days**. And the magnitudes of these effects are clinically meaningful.The findings are consistent with a previous study of people with type-one diabetes. This prior work showed that, compared to afternoon exercise, morning exercise was less likely to lead to blood sugar levels later dropping too low.Nevertheless, there's not a strong consensus about the best time to do HIIT yet. Research in which people who have type-two diabetes completed morning HIIT 90 minutes after a standardized meal showed that the exercise bout improved blood sugar regulation. However, I'd put more stock in the findings of the latest study because in it blood sugar was measured over a longer period, during which the participants did multiple bouts of exercise. Why might the timing of exercise affect blood sugar regulation?Honestly, I don't think we really know the answer to this question. As I discuss in the Circadian OS program (available to Pro members), our bodies' clocks optimize our biology according to the time of day. Various processes peak in the afternoon, including core body temperature and metabolic rate. And our muscle cells have their very own clocks that time various processes in anticipation of physical activity at certain hours each day. Partly as a result of the effects of these clocks, it could be that exercise that relies heavily on carbohydrate use, such as HIIT, sprinting, and weight training, is best placed in the afternoon.Given these changes in core body temperature and skeletal muscle metabolism, it's no surprise that many studies have shown that we're typically strongest and most powerful in the afternoon. I therefore wonder if participants completed more work during the afternoon HIIT sessions. Were this the case, it's plausible that one consequence would be a lowering of blood sugar – higher exercise performance may lead to better metabolic regulation.Another possibility is that it's the timing relationship between physical activity and diet that's important, as some studies of other animals have shown. Were this the case, the negative effects of morning HIIT might be redeemable by appropriately adjusting diet timing.And yet another possibility is simply that participants lost a little sleep in order to arrive at the lab on time during the morning training period. This isn't discussed in the paper but makes sense to me, for sleep loss consistently worsens blood sugar regulation.We should also remember that our bodies (and our bodies' clocks) are adaptable. Interestingly, the average blood sugar levels were numerically lower in the second week of morning HIIT than the first. So, it may be that the participants were adapting to the morning exercise, and perhaps the difference between the conditions would have been nullified had the training continued for longer. Key takeawaysBased on what we know so far, if your goal is to optimize your blood sugar regulation then you may benefit from saving your HIIT for the afternoon. My guess is that this is also true for other forms of vigorous exercise, such as lifting weights or sprinting.Nonetheless, if your schedule only allows you to exercise in the morning, please don't read this and think you should stop exercising! Many other studies have shown that well-executed morning exercise training produces lots of health benefits, after all. _____________________________________________________________________________*The goal of HIIT is to accumulate a substantial amount of high-intensity exercise by interspersing brief bouts of near-maximal efforts with periods of active or passive recovery.** To assess whether the training affected other aspects of metabolic regulation, the participants also gave blood samples at baseline and at the end of each training period. Afternoon HIIT increased concentrations of parathyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and reduced T4 levels. Morning exercise increased thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration only. I'm not sure we can make inferences about what the consequences of these minor changes might be. SupportHave you considered becoming a Pro member of humanOS.me?

The Beer and Blood Sugar Effect,"Yes, I have type 1 diabetes and I can drink beer. In fact, I'm a craft beer lover who's pretty passionate about trying new brews and supporting my local beer makers (who invent awesomeness in a mug). The fact that I'm pancreatically challenged changes nothing about that.Over the years, I've lost count of the times I've heard folks wonder whether PWDs (people with diabetes) are able to drink anything, particularly beer. And I've been amazed to meet medical professionals who take the lazy way out and just tell patients that any drop of alcohol is off-limits. This very directive came my way recently, from a general practitioner who clearly didn't make the cut when I was searching for a new primary care physician.Obviously, I'm not a doctor. But in my nearly 20 years of legally drinking countless beers (all of them with T1D on tap, too), I would like to think I've learned a thing or two -- particularly that YES, you can and should be able to enjoy beer with diabetes if you want to, of course doing so responsibly in the context of society and your health.For most of my life, I'd never thought too deeply about the specifics of beer influencing my diabetes management. Sure, I knew it raises my blood sugar in the short-term, and can increase my hypo risk over the ensuing hours and next day. But that's about it.The general information available online isn't particularly helpful, either. Try searching for ""beer and diabetes,"" or toss ""blood sugar"" into the Google mix, and you'll find mostly boring, cautious bits of information that are certainly not practical. You might find general info that a light beer or ""regular"" 12-ounce beer has a certain number of carbs, but it's quickly followed by ""don't drink more than X servings and to talk to your doctor."" Of course, beer affects different people in different ways, so it's all a matter of individual trial-and-error, but isn't that true for pretty much everything in the world of diabetes? So, I decided to investigate this on my own, much like I did a while back in the ""Great Coffee and Diabetes Experiment.""Let's refer to this one as: The Beer and Blood Sugar Effect.Share on PinterestDisclaimer: Like everyone with a working pancreas, we PWDs have to weigh the risks of alcohol consumption and take care in drinking responsibly. For us, that means carefully calculating insulin doses, while also being aware of how alcohol in general affects our blood sugar. We've been able to offer some great tips here at the 'Mine from Dr. Jeremy Pettus at UCSD on safe drinking with diabetes. Best Locations for Beer TastingMy curiosity on beer and diabetes piqued a couple of years ago when a conversation with a friend in the D-Community coincided with International Beer Day. That conversation evolved into talk of ""best beer states,"" and I of course mentioned my home state of Michigan that's ranked one of the top in the country. This friend was from a state not in those rankings.This was in late 2015 not long after we'd just moved back to Michigan after being away for more than a decade. In mid-September of that year, I began what would become a three-month, non-scientific analysis of my beer and BG effect. The home base of operations became local microbrewery Baffin Brewing Company in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. The brewery theme and logo are centered on a Burmese mountain dog named Baffin that once belonged to the head brewer, which I find awesome (those who know me and my Riley Dog can attest to my canine affection).Share on PinterestWhat's even more cool is that this brewery focuses on reuse, sustainability and being eco-friendly, and it's housed in a historic brick building that's one of the oldest in the city. The taproom walls are made from reclaimed bricks from Detroit buildings in the 1920s era and the bar itself is made from 100+-year-old reclaimed lumber.This place is way-cool as it relates to diabetes, too. Take this example: when I wandered into the brewery thirsty to try a new microbrew pitched as a ""maple syrup infused"" beer, I immediately saw the sign of a good local microbrewery. With the beer sample came the warning, ""Oh yeah. That 1 will raise ur blood sugar."" And did I mention that at the time they had just recently tapped a new brew called DOC? It may be pronounced ""dock,"" but I like to order this one by spelling out the letters, and thinking that it stands for Diabetes Online Community. Yep, this is a great place -- and it's only a half-mile from my house, so you can imagine how often I frequent Baffin. :) Needless to say, this brewery was my home base, so to speak, for my big experiment. Microbrews, with Diabetes On TapBetween mid-September and mid-December, I examined four different types of beer and the effect they had on my BGs: a Belgian pale ale named Pope John Pale, an Irish red ale called The Walking Red, their dark imperial coffee stout named Bob Barley., and an IPA (whether it was the Don't Hop, Mosiac Moproblems, or Hopstepper double IPA brews).I also sampled a few others, from the outstanding ""Holland Oats"" oatmeal stout to the very sweet ""Kane and Maple"" holiday beer has gallons of maple syrup added, with which I could feel my BGs rising just by looking at it! But the four varieties mentioned above were my mainstay.For each brew, I established a baseline -- no food, no Insulin On Board (IOB), no intense exercise or BG swings before the tasting began. I wanted to begin with as steady a flat line in the 80-160 range as possible.Testing each beer had three parts:A single beer without any insulin dosing. Repeat a second day for confirmation to establish a baseline.One beer with insulin. Repeat, possibly adjusting dosing slightly if needed.Two or three beers with insulin, using the baseline and carb-counting info. Repeat to confirm.Overall, this experiment meant 8 beers of each style -- a total of 32 beers consumed over the course of a few months. That's just over 10 beers a month, or 2 or 3 per week.Needless to say, this took some time and effort.It was interesting to see at times the additional effects of using the fast-acting inhaled insulin Afrezza, trying out two different CGMs (continuous glucose monitors), and playing with my insulin doses and different food factors like lower-carb, higher-fat options. I realize that these variables make my experiment decidedly convoluted, but I still felt it had value for me as an ""N of 1"" trial-and-error effort. There were a number of times when I got de-railed by a lack of willpower in resisting a meal or exercise a few hours post-beer and therefore forfeited those BG results. And yes, the free popcorn at Baffin certainly didn't help and was very tough to resist!Share on Pinterest Resources on Drinking Beer with DiabetesThis whole process also made me look more closely at the beer-brewing process, trying to understanding how the making of different brews might play into their ""diabetes effect.""Four key resources I found the most helpful came from the Diabetes Daily Grind, and a carb-calorie count list over at Beer100.com.Podcast on Beer &amp; Diabetes: D-peeps Ryan Fightmaster and Amber Clour over at Diabetes Daily Grind offer an outstanding podcast on this topic, interviewing some local Oklahoma craft brewers and talking about the nitty-gritty of brewing and how beer affects diabetes management. This was very educational and fun, and I learned specifically that the amount of sugar put into a beer during the initial brewing process isn't necessarily transformed into carbs; much of it's burned out as the substance turns to alcohol. But some does carry over, especially in higher alcohol mixes, and brewers can make a beer sweeter if they choose. I was also intrigued to hear them discuss how difficult it could actually be to require brewers to list the carb count on their wares. Fascinating stuff!Six Beer Questions: I also very much enjoyed the personal post from Ryan of DDG, outlining the 6 questions he thinks about when deciding to drink beer. These echo my thoughts in many ways, and it's just a handy go-to list to keep bookmarked. I had already started this Beer and BG Effect effort by the time he wrote this, but I certainly had this checklist in mind when going about my ""research.""Online Beer Info: The all-in-one brew hub Beer100.com offers a calorie info sheet with estimated carb counts on a huge number of domestic and imported beers. I've used this list and found it pretty spot-on for me in carb-counting and insulin dosing for beer.DOC Gems: Of course, for personal anecdotes and stories from other PWDs, I've found myself re-reading what our friend and colleague Wil Dubois has written on this topic in our Ask D'Mine column, as well as some of the testimonials shared over at the Drinking With Diabetes site.All helpful stuff, if I do say so myself, and a lot of this factored into my experiment.So, what did I find? My Beer and Blood Sugar TakeawaysThe four types of Michigan microbrewed beer I tasted boosted my blood sugar an average of 75 to 115 points for each beer, without any insulin. And without insulin, my BG jumped about 100 points for just a single stout.Share on PinterestNo matter the beer, it took about 30 minutes to start raising my blood sugar, but my levels began to smooth out within a couple of hours post-consumption. Sometimes they even started dropping. Typical beer takes about 1.5 units of insulin for me (matched well with most carb counts of 17g or so). If I had a couple beers in one session and took 3 units stretched out over the course of an hour, I found I could stay in range, nice and steady on the CGM graph. With a 25-minute pre-bolus, after drinking I typically see the ""alcohol liver effect,"" which is caused by your liver being too busy processing the residual alcohol in your system to naturally release the necessary glucose needed when your BG starts to drop. As a result, you can get hypoglycemic even though the initial beer (or cocktail) may have raised your BG level. I found that my blood sugar usually starts dropping within 6 hours after drinking two or three brews. But it's not a dramatic drop, so nothing to worry about too much for me.But this phenom was especially interesting to watch when my wife and I attended a brew festival at the Detroit Zoo and I had the chance to try about 16 small samples of various Michigan microbrews -- the equivalent of roughly 4 or 5 full-size beers. That's more than I usually have in one night (!), and I saw higher BGs immediately post-beer, but then a drop several hours later and into the following day. I'm sure the earlier low-carb dinner, all the extra walking around the Detroit Zoo played a part in that, too.Moral of the story: advance planning is key to being able to go out and enjoy a few brews. As a PWD, you have to think hard about the type of drink you'll be imbibing, and the food and physical activity that will likely accompany it.Overall, I learned a lot about the actual effect my favorite types of beer can have on my D-management. Now, armed with this new information, the only challenge left is to... find a microbrewery that's actually operated by a PWD. That would certainly be a taproom worth visiting!",https://t.co/2KSZEXKvId,news
7-day Indian diet plan for type 2 diabetes: Vegetarian and non-vegetarian food chart to control blood sugar,"7-day Indian diet plan for type 2 diabetes: Vegetarian and non-vegetarian food chart to control blood sugar&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Diabetes is said to be more prevalent than any other lifestyle diseases in India, which is home to about 74 million people with this chronic ailment. But the uncertainty of what foods to eat, what foods to avoid and the challenge of sticking to a diet plan are some common issues many diabetics face. If you have type 2 diabetes, managing blood sugar levels is important to living well with the condition. A healthy diabetes meal plan that is nutritionally-balanced will help control your blood sugar, lose weight, and reduce common complications.

"7 More Health Benefits of Moringa: Improve digestion, balance blood sugar, and more","Moringa offers a powerhouse of nutrients—it's high in fiber, protein, magnesium and potassium. It contains more calcium than milk, more iron than spinach and more vitamin C than oranges. While the leaves contain most of the nutrition, the pods themselves are an excellent source of vitamin C, boasting 157% of the RDA. Its high antioxidant content has made it of particular interest in the wellness community, and it has been used globally to treat infections, malnutrition, anemia, and allergies.This latest buzz-worthy superfood has drawn attention for its promising health benefits in recent research (including more than 1,300 studies). We've already listed the top 7 health benefits of Moringa - here's a look at 7 more. 7 Health Benefits of MoringaIt Balances HormonesA 2014 study done in the Journal of Food and Science Technology examined the role that Moringa's antioxidant levels had on postmenopausal women, and found it significantly decreased markers of oxidative stress. It had a therapeutic effect on the hormonal issues that result from decreased estrogen production (and consequently, decreased antioxidant effect) during menopause. The study also found that the women supplementing with Moringa had better fasting blood glucose, and an increase in haemoglobin, both of which point to more balanced hormones and anti-aging effects.Another study looked at the effect that Moringa leaf extract had on the thyroid, and found it may help with the regulation of hyperthyroidism. The study, which analyzed thyroid hormone in rats, saw positive results for female rats, with no significant changes for male rats, indicating Moringa may particularly benefit female hormone health.It Improves DigestionIf bloating, gas, and bathrooms woes seem to always have you down, Moringa might offer a natural solution. Thanks to its high antioxidant content, Moringa might also be a good tool to improve your digestion, and better manage digestive disorders, according to some studies. A 2014 study found that Moringa's anti-inflammatory properties had a beneficial effect on colitis. Compared to controls, Moringa was able to reduce the severity of ulcers and overall inflammation. This promising research shows that Moringa might be a great natural option for people with IBD conditions looking to prevent recurrences.It Balances Blood SugarHigh blood sugar is on the rise—and it comes with a raised risk of diabetes and heart disease. Enter Moringa. Several studies have demonstrated that Moringa may help lower blood sugar, and as a result, reduce the risk of diabetes. The same study that looked at postmenopausal women also found a 13.5% reduction in fasting blood glucose. Another study on animals found that an oral dose of Moringa reduced fasting blood glucose by 26.7%. Moringa, combined with a healthy diet low in processed sugars, could be very beneficial in helping to treat and prevent diabetes. As an added bonus, balanced blood sugar means more balanced energy throughout the day, less irritability and mood swings, and reduced sugar cravings.It Protects The Brain A 2011 study tested Moringa as a treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, and found that its high vitamin C and E content help it to combat oxidative stress. This in turn enhances memory from nootropic activity—it modifies norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. While the study looked specifically at neurodegenerative diseases, this may have benefits for mental health in general as Moringa has also been shown to boost feel-good hormone serotonin. Furthermore, various mood disorders, like anxiety and depression, have been linked to inflammation in the brain, which is precisely what Moringa has been shown to reduce.It Reduces InflammationSpeaking of inflammation in the brain, Moringa actually reduces inflammation in the whole body. Inflammation is linked to almost every chronic disease: dementia, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, the list goes on. Moringa suppresses inflammatory enzymes, and one study found that the bioactive compounds in Moringa, specifically from consuming a pod extract, may help with the prevention of chronic illness. Another study showed that Moringa was able to decrease gene expression and the production of inflammatory markers, which helped to alleviate low-grade inflammation in the body.It Protects The Liver Our liver is responsible for fat metabolism, fructose metabolism, bile production, and for filtering out all the toxins and waste in the body—a job that can be extremely taxing. Due to Moringas high level of polyphenols, it's able to help protect the liver from oxidative stress and toxicity. To best be able to perform all of these functions, the liver requires liver enzymes, and Moringa helps to restore these to normal levels. Moringa has also been shown to reduce liver fibrosis, and reverse oxidative stress—which could have profound implications for human health.It Improves And Rejuvenates SkinNot surprisingly, Moringa has natural anti-bacterial and anti-microbial properties. This combined with its high antioxidants and anti-inflammatory abilities make it great for improving and protecting the skin. One study found that Moringa was able to enhance skin revitalization, giving it anti-aging properties, and it can also help with everything from wounds, burns, acne, and dandruff.It's easy to add Moringa to your daily diet, and reap the seemingly endless benefits of this amazing plant, by simply including a supplement powder to your daily smoothie.",https://t.co/V1jkj9W1rI,news
How to Grow a SCOBY and make Kombucha at Home,"The world of kombucha has been something of a mystery for a long time and aside from a few movie references and jokes about it, the average person didn't really know much about it. It wasn't until recent years that it has seemed to surge in popularity and for good reason! Not only is it a tangy, tasty beverage, but it also has some great probiotics to enhance your gut health.The exact origins of kombucha are unknown, but it is thought to have originated in Northeastern China or Eastern Russia. It is normally comprised of either black or green tea which has been sweetened with spices and/or citrus added. Kombucha can be flavored any way you like, as long as it has been fermented utilizing a ""SCOBY"". SCOBY stands for Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast, and is also referred to as a ""mother"" or ""mushroom"". As unappealing as this sounds, the flattened jellyfish appearance of a SCOBY is even more unique.SCOBY can be purchased in a lot of different places such as health food stores, online, or most commonly just passed around between friends or at community swaps. If you are interested in growing your own, it is simple and only requires water, sugar and either a bottle of organic apple cider or another already-made kombucha.Growing a SCOBYIf you have ever seen the tan colored, foggy particles, settled at the bottom of your apple cider vinegar or store bought kombucha, than think twice about pouring it out next time. This is the starting point for your personal SCOBY. After you have used or drank all but the lower inch of the vinegar/kombucha, swirl it around and pour the remainder into a wide mouthed, deep container (often a wide-mouthed quart jar). Next you can add a cup of water (room temp) with three tablespoons of sugar stirred into it. Cover this container with a coffee filter fastened by a rubber band. Place this in a dark spot that stays above 65°F, then leave it alone for about a week! When you return to it, you will add one tablespoon of water and one tablespoon of sugar, then once again leave it alone for a few more days. At this point you will begin to notice a little film growing on top of your liquid and this is the beginning of your SCOBY! You will continue to add a tablespoon of both sugar and water every 3-5 days and over the next month you will begin to see this thin layer of SCOBY begin to thicken and grow. Using your SCOBY to make KombuchaKombucha can be made with many different mixtures, so I will give you my favorite recipe and general concepts to follow for your first go at it.Kombucha Recipe3 quarts water1 cup sugar (regular granulated sugar works best)8 bags black tea, green tea, or a mix (or 2 tablespoons loose tea)2 cups starter tea from last batch of kombucha or store-bought kombucha (unpasteurized, neutral-flavored)1 SCOBY per fermentation jar, homemade or purchased online2 cups orange juice2-inch piece of ginger root cut into small coins1. To start, you are going to need a large container that is okay to be used for a good week or two, this will be your fermentation vessel. Most often I will brew mine in roughly a one-gallon batch. Once you have your container, you will also need a breathable cloth or paper such as a coffee filter. This needs to be large enough to cover the opening of your container with enough over hang to fasten it with a string or rubber band.2. From here you are going to need a pot large enough to fit all your water plus about 25% more space to avoid overflow. Begin by boiling your water.Once your water has come to a boil, turn it off and you will then add your sugar (normally about 10% of the water).Once sugar is dissolved add your tea bags and any additional spices or flavor component at this point as well too steep for about 15 minutes. If you are adding fruit juices, add this after tea has steeped for brighter flavors.3. Remove your teabags and spices by straining your liquid as you pour it into you fermenting vessel. Leaving your tea bags in too long creates a bitter taste and the spices will continue giving flavor to the kombucha which if left too long will overpower your other flavors.4. Next you must let the tea mixture cool down to less than 110 degrees. After it has reached this temperature you can then put your SCOBY into your tea mixture and cover the vessel with your breathable top.Make sure to label this so you know the dates started and then place your vessel in a dark space that stays between 65°F- 80°F. Leave it alone for about 7 days.5. After 7 days, you will want to sample a small amount of your kombucha. At this point you are likely to need more time (often another week) but depending on the size and power of your SCOBY it's worth checking. You want to find your own happy balance on sweet and tangy/tart. The best rule of thumb is if you like it then you are done. Longer fermentation will enhance your probiotic value, but if you don't enjoy it, then what is the use in taking it any further?6. Next you will carbonate your kombucha which is a natural occurrence after bottling. You are best off to either reuse other screw top bottles or any form of mason jar/ latch top bottles. The number one thing to be sure of it that they are sanitized by boiling water or by chemical sanitizer (follow the packet instructions).7. Once you have sterilized your containers, you can fill them with your kombucha and leave about a half inch of space at the top and tighten the top well. Place your bottles out of direct sunlight at room temperature for an additional 2-3 days then straight into the refrigerator to stop the carbonation for building any additional pressure. Your kombucha can be stored refrigerated for up to a month.8. It is easier to use at least one plastic bottle for your first few batches. This will allow you to squeeze the bottle each day and when it is rock hard you know the carbonation is all set. When you have a good idea of the time-line for your recipe, you can then use all glass.At this point you have yourself a delicious beverage to enjoy chilled or in a mixed cocktail. Kombucha is tasty and although it does take a little planning and time, it is something well worth the work. The nutritional benefits are fantastic for regulating your digestion, clearing skin, countering side effects of antibiotics, regulating blood sugar, aiding in cholesterol levels and so much more!

Three Must Eat Breakfast Foods,"Do you love your breakfast? Do you have a short list of ""go-to"" recipes? Do you need a bit of inspiration to start eating breakfast again?Getting some protein at each meal can help with blood sugar management, metabolism, and weight loss. This is because protein helps you feel fuller longer and uses up a bunch of calories to absorb and metabolize it. So I'm going to show you how to get the protein, as well as some veggies and healthy fats, for your soon-to-be favorite new ""go-to"" breakfasts. Breakfast Food #1: EggsYes, eggs are the ""quintessential"" breakfast food. And for good reason! No, I'm not talking about processed egg whites in a carton. I mean actual whole ""eggs"". Egg whites are mostly protein while the yolks are the real nutritional powerhouses. Those yolks contain vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and healthy fats. Eggs have been shown to help you feel full, keep you feeling fuller longer, and help to stabilize blood sugar and insulin.Not to mention how easy it is to boil a bunch of eggs and keep them in the fridge for a ""grab and go"" breakfast when you're running short on time. And...nope the cholesterol in eggs is not associated with an increased risk of arterial or heart diseases. One thing to consider is to try to prevent cooking the yolks at too high of a temperature because that can cause some of the cholesterol to become oxidized. It's the oxidized cholesterol that's heart unhealthy. Breakfast Food #2: Nuts and/or SeedsNuts and seeds contain protein, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Nuts and/or seeds would make a great contribution to breakfast. You won't be fooled by ""candied"" nuts, sweetened nut/seed butters, or chia ""cereals"" with added sugars – you know I'm talking about the real, whole, unsweetened food here. Nuts and seeds are also the ultimate fast food if you're running late in the mornings. Grab a small handful of almonds, walnuts, or pumpkin seeds as you're running out the door; you can nosh on them while you're commuting. Not to mention how easy it is to add a spoonful of nut/seed butter into your morning breakfast smoothie. Hint: If you like a creamy latte in the mornings, try making one with nut or seed butter. Just add your regular hot tea and a tablespoon or two of a creamy nut or seed butter into your blender &amp; blend until frothy. Breakfast Food #3: VeggiesYes, you already know you really should get protein at every meal including breakfast; but this also applies to veggies. You know I would be remiss to not recommend veggies at every meal, right? Veggies are powerhouses of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytochemicals, fiber, and water. You can't go wrong adding them into every single meal of the day, so if you don't already, you should definitely try them for breakfast! And no, you don't need to have a salad or roasted veggies for breakfast if you don't want to...but you totally can! You wouldn't be breaking any ""official"" breakfast rules or anything like that. Adding some protein to leftover veggies is a great combination for any meal. Including breakfast. I've included a delicious recipe below for you to try (and customize) for your next breakfast. Recipe (Eggs &amp; Veggies): Veggie Omelet Serves 11 teaspoon coconut oil1 or 2 eggs (how hungry are you?)¼ cup veggies (grated zucchini and/or sliced mushrooms and/or diced peppers)dash salt, pepper and/or turmeric Add coconut oil to a frying pan and melt on low-medium heat (cast-iron pans are preferred). In the meantime, grab a bowl and beat the egg(s) with your vegetables of choice and the spices.Tilt pan to ensure the bottom is covered with the melted oil. Pour egg mixture into pan and lightly fry the eggs without stirring.When the bottom is lightly done flip over in one side and cook until white is no longer runny.Serve &amp; Enjoy! Tip: Substitute grated, sliced, or diced portion of your favorite vegetable. Try grated carrots, chopped broccoli, or diced tomato.

7 Surprising Ways Low Blood Sugar Affects You Besides Just Being Hangry,"If you're someone who never leaves home without a granola bar in your bag or keeps your desk stocked with a variety of treats to nibble on, you are winning the snack game and probably rarely have to worry about getting ""hangry."" Whenever your blood sugar levels drop though, you can have a lot more than just grumpiness to contend with. These surprising ways low blood sugar affects you range from getting suddenly sweaty to having trouble making decisions.Eating enough nutrients on a regular basis is a great way to keep your blood sugar from fluctuating, Lorraine Chu, MS, RDN a registered dietitian, tells Bustle. ""A rule of thumb is to make sure your meals are packed with protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs to release energy slowly throughout the day,"" she says. Snacks are also helpful for keeping you balanced in between meals. Check out which foods are low on the glycemic index (GI) to help you plan meals with your blood sugar in mind. Tasty, carb-rich ingredients like pasta, sweet potatoes, and oatmeal are all winners, so enjoy.If you experience these symptoms again and again, don't hesitate to check in with your primary care doctor to make sure you don't need to monitor your blood sugar levels on a regular basis.1. Waking Up In The Middle Of The NightStokkete/Shutterstock""If you ever find yourself waking up at 2 a.m., low blood sugar could be to blame,"" Lisa Richards, a certified nutritionist, tells Bustle. ""When your blood sugar goes too low, your body reacts by releasing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline,"" she says. As a result, you might suddenly feel wide awake even when it's the middle of the night. To prevent this sleep interruption, limit your alcohol consumption and eat a diet rich in proteins and fats to stabilize your blood sugar, Richards says.2. Starting To SweatOllyy/ShutterstockFeeling extra sweaty even though you're sitting still indoors? Chu says that when you have low blood sugar, you'll almost always start sweating. Prevent this by eating breakfast shortly after waking up, she says, as your sugar levels can drop during the night. Eggs and toast or oatmeal with fruit are great (and delicious) options. 3. Feeling ConfusedPhotographee.eu/Shutterstock""One major sign of low blood sugar is difficulty concentrating and even confused thinking,"" Rachel Fine MS, RD, CSSD, CDN, tells Bustle. ""The brain's preferred fuel source is glucose, which is a direct derivative of carbohydrates from food,"" she says. When your blood sugar levels drop, your brain doesn't get enough to function the way it should. This can cause confusion and dizziness, says Fine. Keep an orange in your bag or on your desk at work for a quick and healthy pick-me-up.4. Struggling Through Your WorkoutLightField Studios/ShutterstockAnother surprising result of low blood sugar is poor fitness performance, Fine says. ""Without the energy from glycogen stores (which are the storage form of sugar in the body),"" she says, ""you're less able to kick into a quick and efficient source of energy to push through your cycling class!"" If you're a snack aficionado, you're in luck because fueling up with a protein-rich snack is not only great for building muscle, but it's also a smart way to keep your blood sugar levels stable by slowing down your body's digestion of carbs.5. A Racing HeartTheVisualsYouNeed/ShutterstockLiz Wyosnick, MS, RDN, a registered dietitian and owner of the private practice Equilibriyum, tells Bustle that a racing heart can be one of the signs that your blood sugar is low. ""One of the quickest ways to correct it is to have a piece of fruit,"" she says, ""or even a small amount of fruit juice to quickly bring blood sugar up to a more normalized level."" After your fruity snack, make sure to eat something more substantial with protein or healthy fat so that you don't crash again later. 6. Having Trouble Making DecisionsWAYHOME Studio/ShutterstockWyosnick says that you can also experience poor decision making when your blood sugar level is lower than it should be. ""Low blood sugar can lead to anxiousness and you may be swayed to make decision in haste,"" she says. ""During work hours, this can be especially harmful."" Make sure you're steadily nourished throughout the day with a hearty breakfast and plenty of balanced snacks.7. Unexplained Mood Changeswavebreakmedia/ShutterstockJanet Zappe, a certified diabetes educator in the Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes &amp; Metabolism at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Bustle that low blood sugar can cause more mood changes than just ""hangriness."" It can also make you feel sad or another negative emotion for no apparent reason. If this is something you notice happening regularly, start keeping a log of these mood shifts and how they might be related to what you're eating or how much physical activity you're doing. As you look back, you might start to notice trends that can inform your lifestyle moving forward.Luckily, low blood sugar symptoms can probably be avoided by keeping fruit on hand and making sure not to skip meals. By fueling up regularly, you'll be able to keep your mind sharp and your body working.",https://t.co/JuQ6LacGrk,news
Is running the best exercise for people with type 2 diabetes to lower blood sugar and control weight?,"Running: The best exercise for people with type 2 diabetes to lower blood sugar and control weight&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: For people who suffer from type 2 diabetes, a healthy diet along with regular exercise is the best way to manage blood sugar levels maintain a healthy weight besides medication prescribed by their doctors. Perhaps, one common dilemma that most people face when it comes to staying fit is - whether running is better than walking or vice versa.Type 2 diabetes, if left untreated or poorly managed, can lead to serious health complications related to the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and feet. But healthy lifestyle changes such as improving your diet and exercising on a regular basis can help keep blood sugar levels in check. It will also prevent weight gain and other health issues associated with diabetes. Health experts say running can be particularly beneficial for controlling diabetes as well as reducing the risk of developing the condition in the first place.How does running help people with diabetes control blood sugar levels and weight?According to Diabetes.co.uk, running is an ideal form of exercise for diabetics as it can help improve the body's sensitivity to insulin. This makes running especially helpful for people with type 2 diabetes to combat insulin resistance naturally.Also, one study, which compared running with walking for weight loss and published in the journal Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise, found that people who walk regularly tend to expend less than half as much overall energy through exercise than those who run. Surprisingly, the study also showed greater benefits from running than walking even when the same amount of energy was expended.Running tips for general diabetesRunning regularly will not only help you manage blood sugar levels and lose weight. It will also improve your health in a number of ways - from boosting your heart health to reducing stress and symptoms of depression. Here are a few running tips to keep in mind:Running in the summer months can be more tempting but the risk of dehydration also increases during this time of the year.Dehydration can occur if your blood sugar levels are too high to start with, says Diabetes.co.uk, urging runners to make sure they are at a stable level before setting out - somewhere between 7-10 mmol/l.In case of low blood sugar, the UK's leading diabetes charity suggests to have sufficient sugar - either in glucose tablets or sugary drinks - and wait for your blood sugar to stabilise before running.You can also opt for short runs of between 20-45 minutes several times over a week, with relatively minimal effect on blood sugar levels.If you are running for longer than a 60-minute period, try to carry medical identification. Running with an insulin pump is completely ok and very helpful as it is unlikely to be knocked and risk the tubing being snagged, added the Diabetes.co.ukDon't forget to inform a loved one when going out for a run as hypoglycemia is always a risk - having a running partner is a great idea.Running regularly can benefit your body and mind in many ways. Yet, you can't become a marathon runner overnight, you can start with short running intervals, especially if you're a beginner and trying to improve your diabetes using exercise.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

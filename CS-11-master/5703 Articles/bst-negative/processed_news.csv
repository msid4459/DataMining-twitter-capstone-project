Shots - Health News,"Google is looking to artificial intelligence as a way to make a mark in health care. Michael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Michael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images Google is looking to artificial intelligence as a way to make a mark in health care. Michael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images One of the biggest corporations on the planet is taking a serious interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and health. Google and its sister companies, parts of the holding company Alphabet, are making a huge investment in the field, with potentially big implications for everyone who interacts with Google — which is more than a billion of us. The push into AI and health is a natural evolution for a company that has developed algorithms that reach deep into our lives through the Web. ""The fundamental underlying technologies of machine learning and artificial intelligence are applicable to all manner of tasks,"" says Greg Corrado, a neuroscientist at Google. That's true, he says, ""whether those are tasks in your daily life, like getting directions or sorting through email, or the kinds of tasks that doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients face every day."" Corrado knows a bit about that. He helped Google develop the algorithm that Gmail uses to suggest replies. The company also knows the value of being in the health care sphere. ""It's pretty hard to ignore a market that represents about 20 percent of [U.S.] GDP,"" says John Moore, an industry analyst at Chilmark Research. ""So whether it's Google or it's Microsoft or it's IBM or it's Apple, everyone is taking a look at what they can do in the health care space."" Google, which provides financial support to NPR, made a false start into this field a decade ago. The company backed off after a venture called Google Health failed to take root. But now, Google has rebooted its efforts. Hundreds of employees are working on these health projects, often partnering with other companies and academics. Google doesn't disclose the size of its investment, but Moore says it's likely in the billions of dollars. One of the prime movers is a sister company called Verily, which this year got a billion-dollar boost for its already considerable efforts. Among its projects is software that can diagnose a common cause of blindness called diabetic retinopathy and that is currently in use in India. Verily is also working on tools to monitor blood sugar in people with diabetes, as well as surgical robots that learn from each operation. ""In each of these cases, you can use new technologies and new tools to solve a problem that's right in front of you,"" says cardiologist Jessica Mega, Verily's chief medical and scientific officer. ""In the case of surgical robotics, this idea of learning from one surgery to another becomes really important, because we should be constantly getting better."" Mega says the rise of artificial intelligence isn't that big a departure from devices we're used to, like pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, which jump into action in response to health signals from the body. ""So patients are already seeing this intersection between technology and health care,"" she says. ""It's just we're hitting an inflection point."" That's because the same kinds of algorithms that are giving rise to self-driving cars can also operate in the health care sphere. It's all about managing huge amounts of data. Hospitals have gigabytes of information about the typical patient in the form of electronic health records, scans and sometimes digitized pathology slides. That's fodder for algorithms to ingest and crunch. And Mega says there's a potential to wring a lot more useful information out of it. ""There's this idea that you are healthy until you become sick,"" she says, ""but there's really a continuum"" between health and disease. If computer algorithms can pick up early signs of a slide toward disease, that could help people avoid getting sick. But medical data aren't typically collected for research purposes, so there are gaps. To close those, Verily has partnered with Duke University and Stanford University in an effort called Project Baseline, which seeks to recruit 10,000 volunteers to give tons more data to the company. Judith Washburn and her husband, James Davis, have volunteered to be subjects in Project Baseline, an effort to gather a range of detailed data to characterize and predict how people move from health to illness. Courtesy of James Davis hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of James Davis Judith Washburn and her husband, James Davis, have volunteered to be subjects in Project Baseline, an effort to gather a range of detailed data to characterize and predict how people move from health to illness. Courtesy of James Davis Judith Washburn, a 73-year-old medical librarian and resident of Palo Alto, Calif., signed up after she saw a recruiting ad. ""A couple months later, I got a call to go in, and it's two days of testing, two different weeks and it's very thorough,"" she says. She had heart scans, blood tests, skin swabs and stress tests — a checkup on steroids, if you pardon the expression. Her husband, James Davis, decided he'd give it a go as well. ""They were having trouble finding African-American participants at the time, so I was pretty much a shoo-in,"" he says. ""I'm aware of people who donate their bodies to medical science when they die,"" he says, ""so it's sort of a way of donating your body while it's still alive."" The retired aerospace engineer also got an added benefit. The doctors diagnosed a serious heart condition, and Davis then had triple bypass surgery to treat it. The couple replies to quarterly questionnaires, a gizmo under their mattress tracks their sleep patterns and they each wear a watch that monitors their hearts. The watches also count their steps — sort of. ""They haven't quite figured out your exercise yet,"" Washburn says. ""In fact, I can knit and get steps!"" All this highly personal information goes into the database of a private corporation. Both Washburn and Davis thought about that before signing up but ultimately concluded that's OK. ""It depends upon what they're using it for,"" Washburn says. ""And if it's all for research, I'm fine with that."" Here's what makes Google's position unique. Some of the most useful data could be what the company collects while you're running a Google search, using Gmail or using its Chrome browser. ""As companies like Google and other traditional consumer-oriented companies start moving into this space, it is certainly clear that they bring the capability of taking much of the information they have about us and be able to apply it,"" says Reed Tuckson, a well-known academic physician who was recently recruited to advise Verily about Project Baseline. For example, people's browsing history can reveal a lot about what they buy, how they exercise and other facets of their lifestyles. ""We now understand that that has a great deal to do with the health decisions that we make,"" says Tuckson, who is on a National Academy of Medicine working group that's exploring artificial intelligence in medicine. He says Google needs to tread carefully around these privacy issues, but he's bullish on the technology. ""We should remember that the status quo is not acceptable by itself and that we've got to use every tool at our disposal — use them intelligently"" to improve the health of Americans, he says. ""And I think that's why it's exciting."" Tuckson isn't the only influential recruit to the effort. Verily recently brought in Dr. Robert Califf, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, as well as Vivian Lee, a radiologist who headed the University of Utah's health care system. Google hired David Feinberg, a physician who ran Geisinger, a major health care provider based in Danville, Pa. ""It seems like it was a bit of a war on talent right now between Amazon and Google and to a certain extent Apple,"" says Moore, the analyst. Google needs to build credibility in the medical sphere. ""I think Google is trying to have those people that can basically proof out what Google is doing and stand up and say, 'Yes, Google can do this,' "" Moore says. He also has his eye on what the company's investment means for the rapidly developing industry around health care and artificial intelligence. ""Anyone should take Google very seriously,"" he says. Some big players, like Apple and Microsoft, can hold their own. ""For other AI companies that don't have those resources, they're going to have to be very judicious in picking the niches they want to target, niches that are ones that, frankly, Google is not terribly interested in,"" Moore says. Getting the technology to work is just the start. The health care business is ""a very complex ecosystem,"" says Dr. Lonny Reisman, a former health insurance executive who now heads HealthReveal, a company that develops algorithms to help doctors choose the appropriate therapy. Google will need to answer many questions as it enters that landscape. Who will have an incentive to buy software based on artificial intelligence? Will it really save time or money, as advocates often assert? Or is it just the next new driver of health care inflation? ""There are all these competing forces around cost containment,"" Reisman says. It's not easy to balance innovation, access, fairness and health equity, he adds, ""so they've got a lot on their plate."" Google's Corrado says collaborations with academics and the health care industry are key for navigating this territory. ""A big part of the way that research and development should work in this space is by having kind of a long-term portfolio of technologies that you percolate through the academic and scientific community and then you percolate through the clinical community,"" Corrado says. For all the challenges of forging a new path into health care, Google has a potentially enormous advantage in all the data it collects from its billions of users. Corrado says the company is well aware of the sensitivity of putting that information to use and is thinking about how to approach that without provoking a backlash. ""It has to be something that is driven by the patients' desire to use their own information to better their wellness,"" Corrado says. In a world where people are increasingly concerned about how their personal data are exploited, that could be even more of a challenge than building the computer algorithms to digest and interpret it all.

Common blood sugar drug found to reverse heart failure in non-diabetics,"A drug used to treat type 2 diabetes called empagliflozin may also be an effective treatment for heart failure. The findings were revealed in a newly published study, which found that empagliflozin was able to reverse heart failure in non-diabetic animals. In addition, this particular medication was found to help the heart function more efficiently and produce more energy. The research comes out of Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, where scientists found the drug may be a heart failure treatment option for both diabetics and non-diabetics. Past research has found that diabetics — a population prone to developing heart failure — were less likely to develop the issue when taking empagliflozin.This drug, which is sold under the brand name Jardiance, was approved by the FDA in 2014 as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. The medication lowers blood sugar levels and limits sugar resorption in the kidneys. Past research involving the drug noted that type 2 diabetics who take the medication typically don't develop heart failure, prompting this latest research into its potential preventative benefit.To test this possible benefit, researchers induced heart failure in 14 pigs that did not have diabetes. Half of these animals were then treated with empagliflozin and compared, after two months, to the other half of the group receiving a placebo. Improved heart function was noted in all of the pigs that received empagliflozin, as well as lower levels of water in the lungs and lower heart failure biomarkers.The study found that in these treated pigs, the left ventricles in their hearts experienced stronger contractions, weren't as thick, and were less dilated than in the other group of pigs. As well, the hearts of these animals were a normal shape, meaning they hadn't stretched out or experienced other similar issues. The researchers also noted that these pigs experienced improved cardiac metabolism.The study's co-lead author Carlos Santos-Gallego, MD, explained:This study confirmed our hypothesis that empagliflozin is an incredibly effective treatment for heart failure and not only an antidiabetic drug … This is extremely important because heart failure is a disease with a mortality above 50 percent at 5 years. This study offers a new therapeutic strategy in heart failure, something badly needed given that there have not been new effective drugs for heart failure since the 1990s.The drug is now being studied in a clinical trial as a potential heart failure treatment for humans who don't have diabetes.",https://t.co/4Y2tjyNEkJ,news
Mood Swings? Low Energy? Check Your Blood Sugar Level,"Mood swings and low energy are common in people with diabetes, but the symptoms can be managedBy Wendy HaafA new feature in Good Times magazine is Your Health Questions, where we answer questions submitted by our readers about health, nutrition, and well-being:Is it normal for a person with diabetes who takes insulin to have mood swings and low energy?""Mood swings and low energy are very common in people with diabetes, whether they're on insulin or not,"" says Shelley Jones, a registered nurse and certified diabetes educator in Salisbury, NB, and co-chair of Diabetes Canada's professional section. But that doesn't mean you have to resign yourself to feeling that way for good: the symptoms can usually be improved and perhaps even eliminated.For one thing, worry and the day-to-day challenges of managing a complex chronic disease can be emotionally draining and cause changes in mood, particularly when you're starting a new regimen; getting support and advice from a certified diabetes educator can ease this distress.""This kind of help is very beneficial,"" stresses Dr. Agron Alija, a London, ON, family physician who works with clinical educators from St. Joseph's Health Care London. (If your physician can't connect you with a diabetes educator, Jones suggests that you speak with your pharmacist.)Another prime suspect is fluctuations in blood sugar levels.""Swings in blood sugar can affect your mood,"" Jones explains. If your sugar level is too high, that means the sugar is still in your bloodstream—it's not getting moved into the cells where the work gets done. That can make you tired and affect your thinking, because your brain isn't getting the fuel it needs to do its job,"" she says. ""If your sugar level is dropping too low, same thing. Without enough sugar available, the cells are starved, so they're not functioning quite the way they should and you feel tired."" Alija adds, ""If I see someone in the ER with very low blood sugar, they're anxious and jittery—as soon as you correct that, they feel better.""A little detective work can help determine whether yo-yoing blood sugar levels are the culprit and point to possible ways of smoothing them out. ""If one of my patients was having this issue, I'd first suggest doing a bit more self-monitoring of blood glucose to try to figure out what's going on,"" Jones says. Keeping a journal of your blood glucose levels and a log of what you're eating may help you spot patterns—for example, it may be that a particular food is causing your sugars to spike. ""I'd also suggest talking with your diabetes educator about your blood glucose numbers and about what your insulin doses are doing or not doing,"" Jones says.While it may take some experimentation, with guidance from your diabetes educator, you should be able to adjust your medication, diet, and exercise routines to keep your sugar level on a more even keel. ""Once it's stable,"" Alija says, ""people will notice their mood improves, their relationships improve…everything improves.""For more information on diabetes, visit: diabetes.ca.Photo: iStock/seamartini.",https://t.co/tRLISCpfjx,news
The Beer and Blood Sugar Effect,"Yes, I have type 1 diabetes and I can drink beer. In fact, I'm a craft beer lover who's pretty passionate about trying new brews and supporting my local beer makers (who invent awesomeness in a mug). The fact that I'm pancreatically challenged changes nothing about that.Over the years, I've lost count of the times I've heard folks wonder whether PWDs (people with diabetes) are able to drink anything, particularly beer. And I've been amazed to meet medical professionals who take the lazy way out and just tell patients that any drop of alcohol is off-limits. This very directive came my way recently, from a general practitioner who clearly didn't make the cut when I was searching for a new primary care physician.Obviously, I'm not a doctor. But in my nearly 20 years of legally drinking countless beers (all of them with T1D on tap, too), I would like to think I've learned a thing or two -- particularly that YES, you can and should be able to enjoy beer with diabetes if you want to, of course doing so responsibly in the context of society and your health.For most of my life, I'd never thought too deeply about the specifics of beer influencing my diabetes management. Sure, I knew it raises my blood sugar in the short-term, and can increase my hypo risk over the ensuing hours and next day. But that's about it.The general information available online isn't particularly helpful, either. Try searching for ""beer and diabetes,"" or toss ""blood sugar"" into the Google mix, and you'll find mostly boring, cautious bits of information that are certainly not practical. You might find general info that a light beer or ""regular"" 12-ounce beer has a certain number of carbs, but it's quickly followed by ""don't drink more than X servings and to talk to your doctor."" Of course, beer affects different people in different ways, so it's all a matter of individual trial-and-error, but isn't that true for pretty much everything in the world of diabetes? So, I decided to investigate this on my own, much like I did a while back in the ""Great Coffee and Diabetes Experiment.""Let's refer to this one as: The Beer and Blood Sugar Effect.Share on PinterestDisclaimer: Like everyone with a working pancreas, we PWDs have to weigh the risks of alcohol consumption and take care in drinking responsibly. For us, that means carefully calculating insulin doses, while also being aware of how alcohol in general affects our blood sugar. We've been able to offer some great tips here at the 'Mine from Dr. Jeremy Pettus at UCSD on safe drinking with diabetes. Best Locations for Beer TastingMy curiosity on beer and diabetes piqued a couple of years ago when a conversation with a friend in the D-Community coincided with International Beer Day. That conversation evolved into talk of ""best beer states,"" and I of course mentioned my home state of Michigan that's ranked one of the top in the country. This friend was from a state not in those rankings.This was in late 2015 not long after we'd just moved back to Michigan after being away for more than a decade. In mid-September of that year, I began what would become a three-month, non-scientific analysis of my beer and BG effect. The home base of operations became local microbrewery Baffin Brewing Company in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. The brewery theme and logo are centered on a Burmese mountain dog named Baffin that once belonged to the head brewer, which I find awesome (those who know me and my Riley Dog can attest to my canine affection).Share on PinterestWhat's even more cool is that this brewery focuses on reuse, sustainability and being eco-friendly, and it's housed in a historic brick building that's one of the oldest in the city. The taproom walls are made from reclaimed bricks from Detroit buildings in the 1920s era and the bar itself is made from 100+-year-old reclaimed lumber.This place is way-cool as it relates to diabetes, too. Take this example: when I wandered into the brewery thirsty to try a new microbrew pitched as a ""maple syrup infused"" beer, I immediately saw the sign of a good local microbrewery. With the beer sample came the warning, ""Oh yeah. That 1 will raise ur blood sugar."" And did I mention that at the time they had just recently tapped a new brew called DOC? It may be pronounced ""dock,"" but I like to order this one by spelling out the letters, and thinking that it stands for Diabetes Online Community. Yep, this is a great place -- and it's only a half-mile from my house, so you can imagine how often I frequent Baffin. :) Needless to say, this brewery was my home base, so to speak, for my big experiment. Microbrews, with Diabetes On TapBetween mid-September and mid-December, I examined four different types of beer and the effect they had on my BGs: a Belgian pale ale named Pope John Pale, an Irish red ale called The Walking Red, their dark imperial coffee stout named Bob Barley., and an IPA (whether it was the Don't Hop, Mosiac Moproblems, or Hopstepper double IPA brews).I also sampled a few others, from the outstanding ""Holland Oats"" oatmeal stout to the very sweet ""Kane and Maple"" holiday beer has gallons of maple syrup added, with which I could feel my BGs rising just by looking at it! But the four varieties mentioned above were my mainstay.For each brew, I established a baseline -- no food, no Insulin On Board (IOB), no intense exercise or BG swings before the tasting began. I wanted to begin with as steady a flat line in the 80-160 range as possible.Testing each beer had three parts:A single beer without any insulin dosing. Repeat a second day for confirmation to establish a baseline.One beer with insulin. Repeat, possibly adjusting dosing slightly if needed.Two or three beers with insulin, using the baseline and carb-counting info. Repeat to confirm.Overall, this experiment meant 8 beers of each style -- a total of 32 beers consumed over the course of a few months. That's just over 10 beers a month, or 2 or 3 per week.Needless to say, this took some time and effort.It was interesting to see at times the additional effects of using the fast-acting inhaled insulin Afrezza, trying out two different CGMs (continuous glucose monitors), and playing with my insulin doses and different food factors like lower-carb, higher-fat options. I realize that these variables make my experiment decidedly convoluted, but I still felt it had value for me as an ""N of 1"" trial-and-error effort. There were a number of times when I got de-railed by a lack of willpower in resisting a meal or exercise a few hours post-beer and therefore forfeited those BG results. And yes, the free popcorn at Baffin certainly didn't help and was very tough to resist!Share on Pinterest Resources on Drinking Beer with DiabetesThis whole process also made me look more closely at the beer-brewing process, trying to understanding how the making of different brews might play into their ""diabetes effect.""Four key resources I found the most helpful came from the Diabetes Daily Grind, and a carb-calorie count list over at Beer100.com.Podcast on Beer &amp; Diabetes: D-peeps Ryan Fightmaster and Amber Clour over at Diabetes Daily Grind offer an outstanding podcast on this topic, interviewing some local Oklahoma craft brewers and talking about the nitty-gritty of brewing and how beer affects diabetes management. This was very educational and fun, and I learned specifically that the amount of sugar put into a beer during the initial brewing process isn't necessarily transformed into carbs; much of it's burned out as the substance turns to alcohol. But some does carry over, especially in higher alcohol mixes, and brewers can make a beer sweeter if they choose. I was also intrigued to hear them discuss how difficult it could actually be to require brewers to list the carb count on their wares. Fascinating stuff!Six Beer Questions: I also very much enjoyed the personal post from Ryan of DDG, outlining the 6 questions he thinks about when deciding to drink beer. These echo my thoughts in many ways, and it's just a handy go-to list to keep bookmarked. I had already started this Beer and BG Effect effort by the time he wrote this, but I certainly had this checklist in mind when going about my ""research.""Online Beer Info: The all-in-one brew hub Beer100.com offers a calorie info sheet with estimated carb counts on a huge number of domestic and imported beers. I've used this list and found it pretty spot-on for me in carb-counting and insulin dosing for beer.DOC Gems: Of course, for personal anecdotes and stories from other PWDs, I've found myself re-reading what our friend and colleague Wil Dubois has written on this topic in our Ask D'Mine column, as well as some of the testimonials shared over at the Drinking With Diabetes site.All helpful stuff, if I do say so myself, and a lot of this factored into my experiment.So, what did I find? My Beer and Blood Sugar TakeawaysThe four types of Michigan microbrewed beer I tasted boosted my blood sugar an average of 75 to 115 points for each beer, without any insulin. And without insulin, my BG jumped about 100 points for just a single stout.Share on PinterestNo matter the beer, it took about 30 minutes to start raising my blood sugar, but my levels began to smooth out within a couple of hours post-consumption. Sometimes they even started dropping. Typical beer takes about 1.5 units of insulin for me (matched well with most carb counts of 17g or so). If I had a couple beers in one session and took 3 units stretched out over the course of an hour, I found I could stay in range, nice and steady on the CGM graph. With a 25-minute pre-bolus, after drinking I typically see the ""alcohol liver effect,"" which is caused by your liver being too busy processing the residual alcohol in your system to naturally release the necessary glucose needed when your BG starts to drop. As a result, you can get hypoglycemic even though the initial beer (or cocktail) may have raised your BG level. I found that my blood sugar usually starts dropping within 6 hours after drinking two or three brews. But it's not a dramatic drop, so nothing to worry about too much for me.But this phenom was especially interesting to watch when my wife and I attended a brew festival at the Detroit Zoo and I had the chance to try about 16 small samples of various Michigan microbrews -- the equivalent of roughly 4 or 5 full-size beers. That's more than I usually have in one night (!), and I saw higher BGs immediately post-beer, but then a drop several hours later and into the following day. I'm sure the earlier low-carb dinner, all the extra walking around the Detroit Zoo played a part in that, too.Moral of the story: advance planning is key to being able to go out and enjoy a few brews. As a PWD, you have to think hard about the type of drink you'll be imbibing, and the food and physical activity that will likely accompany it.Overall, I learned a lot about the actual effect my favorite types of beer can have on my D-management. Now, armed with this new information, the only challenge left is to... find a microbrewery that's actually operated by a PWD. That would certainly be a taproom worth visiting!",https://t.co/2KSZEXsUQF,news
"Diabetes drug may prevent, slow kidney disease, study finds","Breaking News EmailsGet breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.SUBSCRIBEApril 15, 2019, 1:48 PM UTCBy Associated PressA drug that's used to help control blood sugar in people with diabetes has now been shown to help prevent or slow kidney disease, which causes millions of deaths each year and requires hundreds of thousands of people to use dialysis to stay alive.Doctors say it's hard to overstate the importance of this study, and what it means for curbing this problem, which is growing because of the obesity epidemic.The study tested Janssen Pharmaceuticals' drug Invokana. Results were discussed Sunday at a medical meeting in Australia and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.About 30 million Americans and more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes, and most cases are Type 2, the kind tied to obesity. It occurs when the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, which turns food into energy.This can damage the kidneys over time, causing disease and ultimately, failure. In the U.S., it's responsible for nearly half a million people needing dialysis, and for thousands of kidney transplants each year.Some blood pressure drugs lower this risk but they're only partially effective. The new study tested Invokana, a daily pill sold now to help control blood sugar, to see if it also could help prevent kidney disease when added to standard treatments.For the study, about 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease from around the world were to be given Invokana or dummy pills. Independent monitors stopped the study early, after 4,400 people had been treated for about 2.5 years on average, when it was clear the drug was helping.Those on the drug had a 30 percent lower risk of one of these problems — kidney failure, need for dialysis, need for a kidney transplant, death from kidney- or heart-related causes, or other signs that kidneys were failing.For every 1,000 people taking the drug for 2.5 years, there would be 47 fewer cases of one of these problems, researchers estimate.Rates of serious side effects were similar in the drug and placebo groups including leg, foot or toe amputations, a concern raised by a previous study of Invokana. One side effect, when the body can't produce enough insulin, was more frequent among those on Invokana but rare overall.Janssen, which is part of Johnson &amp; Johnson, sponsored the study and many authors work or consult for the company. The drug costs about $500 a month in the U.S. Out-of-pocket costs for patients may be different, depending on insurance.The importance of this large and well-done study ""cannot be overstated,"" Drs. Julie Ingelfinger and Clifford Rosen, editors at the medical journal, wrote in an accompanying article.In recent years, several studies have found that Invokana and some similar drugs can lower heart risks.

Weekday-Weekend Sleep Imbalance Bad for Blood Sugar Regulation,"Few things are more satisfying than sleeping late on weekends. But though the extra z's may improve your mood, they do not appear to improve your health. Because a new study shows that so-called ""recovery sleep"" cannot reset the body's metabolic clock…and may actually lead to some serious health issues.""Sleep loss can impact a range of physiological systems. It can increase our risk for cardiovascular disease, it can cause weight gain, it can decrease insulin sensitivity, so it can increase our risk of diabetes….Christopher Depner, an assistant professor in the department of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder.""And this can happen, depending on what you're looking at, this can happen as quick as one or two nights of not getting enough sleep.""A lot of us shut off the alarm on Saturday and Sunday. But we go right back to burning the candle at both ends once the workweek begins.""So we were really interested in how this sort of cycle of insufficient sleep, weekend recovery sleep, insufficient sleep, can impact your risk of obesity and metabolic disease.""Depner and his colleagues invited volunteers to a nine-day snooze-a-thon. One group was allowed to get a full night's sleep. The next was kept to just five hours each night. And the third group went back and forth, restricted to five hours of shut-eye during the workweek, allowed as much sleep as they wanted over the weekend, and then back to five hours for the last couple days.The results?""Well, the key findings from this study show that when we maintain insufficient short sleep schedules during a typical work or school week, we find that this leads people to eat more than they need and this leads to weight gain.""Ken Wright, professor of integrative physiology at U.C. Boulder. He's the senior author of the study, which appears in the journal Current Biology. [Christopher M. Depner et al., Ad libitum Weekend Recovery Sleep Fails to Prevent Metabolic Dysregulation during a Repeating Pattern of Insufficient Sleep and Weekend Recovery Sleep]So it seems a loss of sleep leads to a spike in snacking. But even more surprising, sleeping in on the weekend doesn't help—and even makes things worse.""We found that after the weekend, when they went back to getting insufficient sleep during the work or school week, we found that their liver and their muscle insulin sensitivity or blood sugar regulation was reduced. And this is not something we had found in people who maintained chronic insufficient sleep schedules. So it's possible that, yes, this is a worsening of the body's ability to regulate blood sugar for those specific tissues after the weekend.""So make a date with a pillow.

"Study finds diabetes drug may prevent, slow kidney disease","(AP) – A drug that's used to help control blood sugar in people with diabetes has now been shown to help prevent or slow kidney disease, which causes millions of deaths each year and requires hundreds of thousands of people to use dialysis to stay alive.Doctors say it's hard to overstate the importance of this study, and what it means for curbing this problem, which is growing because of the obesity epidemic.The study tested Janssen Pharmaceuticals' drug Invokana. Results were discussed Sunday at a medical meeting in Australia and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.About 30 million Americans and more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes, and most cases are Type 2, the kind tied to obesity. It occurs when the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, which turns food into energy.This can damage the kidneys over time, causing disease and ultimately, failure. In the U.S., it's responsible for nearly half a million people needing dialysis, and for thousands of kidney transplants each year.Some blood pressure drugs lower this risk but they're only partially effective. The new study tested Invokana, a daily pill sold now to help control blood sugar, to see if it also could help prevent kidney disease when added to standard treatments.For the study, about 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease from around the world were to be given Invokana or dummy pills. Independent monitors stopped the study early, after 4,400 people had been treated for about 2.5 years on average, when it was clear the drug was helping.Those on the drug had a 30% lower risk of one of these problems — kidney failure, need for dialysis, need for a kidney transplant, death from kidney- or heart-related causes, or other signs that kidneys were failing.For every 1,000 people taking the drug for 2.5 years, there would be 47 fewer cases of one of these problems, researchers estimate.Rates of serious side effects were similar in the drug and placebo groups including leg, foot or toe amputations, a concern raised by a previous study of Invokana.

"my coworker is routinely late because she stops for coffee, letting a man open a door at an interview, and more","It's five answers to five questions. Here we go…1. My coworker is routinely late to work because she stops for coffee firstI have a question about a coworker, Sansa, who is routinely ~5-10 minutes late (2-3 times a week). Her job does not require she be here at 9 on the dot. I know being a stickler about a few minutes is not good. However, every morning (not an exaggeration) she is late, she strolls in with Starbucks drinks/food … so in this case, it's not ""traffic was bad"" or ""the kids weren't cooperating"" — both of which I totally understand happen and aren't cause for concern. To me, this is a known discretionary stop on her commute and she should plan appropriately for it. If one day the milk steamer explodes and she is late because of that … well, fine, but this is happening SO often. Honestly it just drives me crazy, but I know I have a pet peeve for habitual tardiness.A further concern is that we are in the midst of recruiting (two offers have been made to new grads and we expect them to start within two months). These new employees will be at the same level, and doing similar work at Sansa (they'll be more or less equals), and I'm worried Sansa is setting a bad precedent.I'm not Sansa's direct manager, but I do have seniority over her (I'm middle management, she is entry level). Am I crazy for wanting to say something to her? I could go to her manager? He and I have a good relationship — we've been working together for seven years and I consider us friends. But that seems extreme.I'm sorry to tell you this, but I think this is a you problem rather than a Sansa problem!You have a pet peeve about habitual tardiness, but the fact that it's your pet peeve doesn't mean Sansa is doing something wrong. The way to solve this isn't to talk to Sansa, but for you to realize that this isn't really your business.Many managers, including me, couldn't care less if someone is routinely five or 10 minutes late, as long as their job doesn't require coverage that starts earlier than that. The question for any manager should be: What is the work impact of this? If there's no work impact and Sansa is doing good work, who cares? I suspect you care because of the principle of the thing — it annoys you on principle that she doesn't take timeliness more seriously. But lots of things can annoy you on principle without it being something you should address.Ultimately, if her manager doesn't care, why do you need to? And if you're thinking, ""Well, her manager is making the wrong call"" — it's not smart to nickel and dime good employees over five or ten minutes, especially when a lot of people value that kind of minor flexibility in their jobs. (Personally I'd be really annoyed if my boss gave me crap about being five minutes late when I was doing great work and it didn't have any impact.)If your concern is that Sansa is setting a bad example for the two new grads who about to start, that's something for those new hires' managers to deal with. If you're their manager and you really need them to arrive at 9 on the dot, then you can let them know that — saying something like, ""You might see some people come in a little later than that, but for our work it's really important that you're here on time because of ____."" (But if you can't figure out what to fill in the blank with, that's a sign that you don't have a reason to require that.)2. I waited for a man to chivalrously open a door for me while I was interviewingI have been a stay-at-home mom for about 16 years, but have been working part-time jobs and most recently have been running my own cooking business. I am trying to get back into a professional, corporate position. I had an interview with the VP of HR in his office. When the interview was over and we went to leave, I walked to the closed office door and he was right behind me. I hesitated when we got to the door so that he could open the door for me. Which he then did.I have no problem opening my own doors, so I don't know why I didn't just open the door myself!?! I know it's not a big deal at all, but do you think this looked bad like I'm some sort of passive, old-fashioned, out of touch woman?! I expect my husband to open doors for me if we're out and about, but I think men and women are equal!! I'm still waiting to hear if I got the job … it's between me and one other candidate. She probably opened the door herself.It's true that it wasn't ideal and in general you don't want to wait for men to open doors for you in a professional context, but I wouldn't worry a ton about it. There are other explanations for why you could have paused there — like that you were letting him take the lead because he was the ""host"" of your visit, not because he was a man, etc.It is true that I'd be concerned if I saw a lot of indications from a candidate that they expected gender-based chivalry in the workplace, but one pause at a door probably wouldn't add up to that. Give yourself permission not to worry about it!3. People in my new office talk non-stop over the cubicle wallsAm I just a jerk or am I right in thinking this? I recently started on a new job where I get my own cubicle (no more sharing desks) so that is pretty exciting! That being said, cubicle etiquette is a little new to me. The problem is, all the people around me talk non-stop over the cubicle walls. For example, two people directly to my right talk over their shared wall for hour-long conversations at a time (work-related, but still frustrating). As I write this, they've been speaking for over two hours almost without break (I timed it).Am I wrong in thinking that if your conversation is going to be longer than a minute or two, you should probably try to find a private room so you don't disturb the people around me? It surely seems like that'd be more beneficial than talking to a wall anyway. I have a lot of trouble focusing with constant chatter in my ear. I tried bringing noise-canceling headphones to work, but there's still just enough noise that I can't focus on anything else.I agree with you, as will lots of others, but ultimately this really depends on the culture of your workplace. If it's an office where lots of people do a lot of talking over cubicle walls, that's just the culture there … and they're not really being rude by participating in that culture and following its norms. If it were just a few people, you could try saying something (like ""I'm sorry to ask but I'm have trouble focusing — would you mind going to a conference room?"") but if it's everyone around you and you're the new person, that's not likely to solve it.It might be worth experimenting with what you're playing in those noise-canceling headphones — if you tried music before, try white or pink noise now, and vice versa. (The comment section on this post has a lot of suggestions of specifics to try.) Otherwise, you may need to hope that in time you get used to working with conversation around you and that you'll be able to tune it out. That does happen for some people — look at reporters who write on deadline in crowded open news rooms! — although I suspect not for everyone. (Although it's actually easier if there's so much conversation around you that it can become one big blur; it's harder when you're hearing just one conversation.)4. Do I need letters of recommendation from my high school teachers?I don't know if you've answered something like this before, but I'm sending this in on my friend's behalf. We graduated high school about a year ago, and we're both in college. Recently, her parents have been hounding her about collecting letters of recommendation from high school teachers. We are both confused at their fixation on receiving letters of recommendation from old teachers without need. What could be a possible application of letters of recommendation from your old high school teachers? They presumably want her to obtain them in order help with searching for a job, but are they even useful as references when looking for a job that will require listed references? Do interviewers even take letters of recommendation anymore? The situation is baffling to the both of us.Yeah, you're not going to need those.First, you're right: the vast majority of employers don't want letters of recommendation anymore; they want to actually speak to references so they can ask their own questions. (There are some exceptions to this, like academia and law, but those are exceptions.) Second, references from high school teachers are going to be of really limited value regardless. Managers from part-time jobs, if you have them, will be better.That said, with the types of jobs you're applying to as a college freshman, it's possible that letters of recommendation could have some limited value just because you don't really have ""references"" in the traditional sense at this point and really, when you're hiring people without much work experience, there's such limited data that it's all a bit of a crapshoot. But you absolutely do not need to be out there collecting letters, definitely not with the fervor your friend's parents are approaching it with.It would be one thing if your friend was looking for a reference and her parents said ""what about your newspaper advisor from high school who liked you so much?"" … but hounding her to do it just as a general rule falls pretty squarely in the category of ""don't take job search advice from your parents.""5. How did phone interviews work before email and cell phones?Yesterday, I telling a friend about how my organization only started doing any kind of phone screen about six months ago and how before that, they just brought a bunch of folks in for interviews. My friend said ""why?!"" My theory is that it was the result of never updating process, that back in the day, before people had cell phones, hiring managers probably couldn't reach applicants during work hours. I don't imagine people could use their work phones. Perhaps they could schedule phone screens in which they called applicants at home, but not everyone would be able to make that work. So then we got to thinking about how one would schedule a phone screen (or even an in-person interview). We had email by the time we graduated college, which seems like it probably really helped with hiring processes. I guess before that, one could leave a message for an applicant at home and they could call from a pay phone during work hours … but what about before answering machines? Did scheduling an (in-person) interview require writing letters back and forth?This conversation occurred on the occasion of my 39th birthday, which means that I am more often on the ""you don't understand how things were"" side of conversations these days. But now I am very eager to learn about hiring processes in years predating answering machines. I would love to hear about it through the lens of AAM reader experiences!Interesting! I'm six years older than you, which means that when I was first entering the work world email was just starting to become a commonplace thing and it definitely wasn't something that had become a standard part of hiring correspondence. And I can barely recall how we did it, although I do remember applying for jobs by fax (!) and setting up interviews by phone. And I bet that you're right about your theories about phone interviews — the logistics would have been a lot trickier.People of the right age whose memories have not abandoned you: How did this work?",https://t.co/pe3XlqQe53,news
"Drug found to help those with type 2 diabetes, keep patients off dialysis","A drug that lowers blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes also lowers the risk of end-stage kidney failure by 30 percent, a finding that may help spare kidney function in scores of patients and save billions of dollars by keeping them off dialysis, doctors reported Monday. Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions on Long Island and beyond, which means problems occurring as a result of it are rising as well. Kidney failure has been increasing by 5 percent a year for more than a decade, and almost half the people on dialysis in the United States have type 2 diabetes. In an international clinical trial that is being hailed as a landmark study, patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease who took the drug Invokana found their risk of advancing to full-blown kidney failure declined by a third. That means the medication helped stave off the need for dialysis and kidney transplants, and reduced the risk of death from end-stage renal disease. In addition to sparing kidney function, the drug also helped reduce cardiovascular problems, the research revealed. ""This is the first study to show such a big effect,"" said Dr. Douglas Lax, chief of nephrology at Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre, who was not part of the research. ""It was also the first to look at patients whose kidney disease was already advanced."" About 13,000 people were tested in the study worldwide, with about half of them receiving Invokana and the other half receiving a placebo. The study was stopped midstream because it would have been unethical to continue with people taking a placebo that wasn't helping. Doctors who led the study, which was called the Credence clinical trial, estimated that for every 1,000 people taking the drug for 2.5 years, there would be 47 fewer cases of kidney failure, dialysis and transplants. Instances of adverse effects in the research — toe, foot and leg amputations — were similar among patients taking Invokana and the placebo. Invokana is a product of Janssen Pharmaceuticals and costs about $475 a month. It was approved in 2013 to lower blood sugar. But doctors who tested it for its capacity to spare kidney function said they hope the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will approve it for this new role. Physicians, meanwhile, are free to use any approved drug ""off label,"" which means prescribing it for a new lifesaving indication. ""Kidney disease can be slowly progressive,"" Lax said, ""but the fact that they could show such large differences between groups is pretty amazing to me."" Lax said Invokana is the first drug for type 2 diabetics that addresses kidney disease in more than 15 years. Although the study has just been published in the New England Journal of Medicine and reported at a medical conference in Australia, Lax said he will consider it for some of his patients. In addition to his role at Mercy, he oversees dialysis centers in Hempstead, Oceanside, Bellmore, Freeport and Woodmere. The National Kidney Foundation commended the research Monday and noted the mounting toll of kidney disease across the country. ""Chronic kidney disease is a largely invisible and growing public health problem with limited treatment options available,"" the kidney foundation said in a statement, adding that the study ""is encouraging for patients with diabetic kidney disease and an important step forward to staving off end-stage renal disease. ""Diabetes is a key risk factor for chronic kidney disease, and accounts for 44 percent of all end-stage renal disease cases. However, less than 40 percent of those with diabetes are completely assessed for kidney disease,"" the foundation said. Nearly 750,000 people annually and 2 million worldwide develop end-stage kidney disease, according to the Kidney Project at the University of California, San Francisco. End-stage kidney disease largely affects diabetics who are elderly of any ethnicity, but is also common among African-Americans, Native Americans and Hispanics of all ages. About 7 percent of Medicare's annual budget is devoted to end-stage kidney disease. Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a co-principal investigator of the research, said Invokana protects kidney function by increasing the amount of glucose excretion through the twin organs. He said the research paves the way for a new treatment option. ""For the first time in 18 years, we have a therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease that decreases kidney failure,"" Mahaffey said. ""Now, patients with diabetes have a promising option to guard against one of the most severe risks of their condition.""",https://t.co/Kz8SyYfmlk,news

"There's No Such Thing as ""Bad"" Blood Sugar","In my previous blog, Managing Blood Sugar and a Relationship: 5 Rules to Live By, I addressed how to cope in a relationship when you have high and low blood sugar episodes. In that entry, I brought up a few questions that need answering. First off, what is emotional self-care? Secondly, when your blood sugar numbers are out of range, what constitutes good internal thought management?Growing Up BadWhen I was growing up, I discovered that if my blood sugar was too high or too low, I was at fault or bad. I remember hiding my blood sugar results from my parents. Back then, there were no blood glucose (BG) monitors—just urine testing kits. I would go to the bathroom and pee on a strip and wait 30 seconds until the strip changed colors. If I recall correctly, blue was in range, and brown was very high. I can't tell you how many times the strip turned brown. It was a lot. I can, however, tell you how many times I told my mother or father. I can count them on one hand; in fact, the correct answer was once.I didn't care to hear that I was bad. It was hard enough knowing that I had messed up and was a bad boy. While growing up, I went around blaming myself for every high and every low. This excessive self-blame was poor emotional management. In fact, that negative thinking sent me on an emotional roller coaster.The Impact of Thinking and Feeling With DiabetesHow we think affects how we feel. How we feel impacts the stability of our blood sugars. Depression, for example, releases cortisol—a hormone that causes the release of glucose into the blood stream. We can only control a few of the factors that impact BG levels, the rest we are unable to control.Later in life, I started to realize that no matter how hard I tried, I could not get my blood sugar management under control. I was in a cycle of ""poor me"" thinking. I blamed myself over and over again. I spent many countless hours trying to keep my blood sugar in range; after all, I didn't want to be called bad.Moving in the Right DirectionAfter enough psychotherapy and life experience, I realized my negative self-blaming was keeping me depressed, my blood sugar high, and was a waste of my time.Shortly after college, I came to a conclusion that I still believe in and, as a professional diabetes-focused psychotherapist, recommend to my clients. The conclusion is that there is no such thing as good and bad blood sugar, only undesirable or desirable.I know some of you are going, ""Wait! Hold on for a darn minute here! Isn't a blood sugar reading of 250 mg/dL bad?"" Well, I am glad you asked. No, it's not—and let me explain.The goal is to keep blood sugar in range. I think most of you will agree on that point, but there are several other truths about BG that need consideration.Several Truths About Blood GlucoseFrom time to time a person with a healthy pancreas may work out for too long and hard, causing their blood sugar to drop below 70 mg/dL. And on the other end of the spectrum, a person may eat or drink lots of fast-acting carbs in a short span, causing blood sugars to rise above 180 mg/dL for a short period. However, there are many advantages a non-diabetic has that keeps their blood sugar under tight control, which is not present in people with type 1 or may only be partly working in type 2 diabetes.Natural insulin has two peaks were genetically created insulin only has one peak. The first of the two peaks reduces the initial impact of the carbohydrates and peaks in 1-2 minutes. The fastest genetically created insulin peak is equivalent to the second peak and happens 1-2 hours after injection.That makes good management an uphill battle. Type 1 diabetics are ill-equipped to handle carbohydrate intake without that initial burst of insulin produced by non-diabetics.Genetically created insulin works differently than natural insulin is one of many things working against ideal BG control. How genetically created insulin works is out of the control of the person with diabetes. With all the potential things that can cause fluctuating blood sugars, how could an individual with diabetes take full responsibility for high or low blood sugar?It's hard to accept that there are things beyond our control. Unfortunately, in life, there are many things outside our control like lines at the post office or a tsunami.Things not in your control will always cause blood sugars to fluctuate out of your target range occasionally, and that's OK. As long as you take the appropriate steps to get them back within normal range, you are doing a great job.Diabetes is unforgiving if you are unable to see the gray. Black and white views like bad and good only cause undue stress and emotional turmoil. BG readings are just numbers to guide you on your next step in managing your diabetes.It may be better to look at high and low numbers as ""undesirable"" instead of ""bad."" ""Bad"" is a punitive word and implies that the owner of the bad number is bad for letting BG numbers go out of range. There is no gray in the word ""bad,"" whereas ""undesirable"" is more emotionally neutral.Emotional self-care is reducing or removing negative internal thinking. Changing the word ""bad"" to ""undesirable"" is a good start. By changing negative words like ""bad"" to ""undesirable"" when your blood sugar numbers are out of range, constitutes good internal thought management.There are many other factors aside from the release of cortisol or insulin peaks that cause BG numbers to become undesirable. I will talk more about those in future blogs, but for now give yourself a break from negative thinking and refer to out-of-range blood sugars as ""undesirable,"" rather than ""bad.""For more information go to Eliot's website, or Facebook Page or set up a free 30-minute phone consultation to see if talk therapy is right for you.Eliot LeBow, LCSW, CDE, is a diabetes-focused psychotherapist.

Shots - Health News,"Google is looking to artificial intelligence as a way to make a mark in health care. Michael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Michael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images Google is looking to artificial intelligence as a way to make a mark in health care. Michael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images One of the biggest corporations on the planet is taking a serious interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and health. Google and its sister companies, parts of the holding company Alphabet, are making a huge investment in the field, with potentially big implications for everyone who interacts with Google — which is more than a billion of us. The push into AI and health is a natural evolution for a company that has developed algorithms that reach deep into our lives through the Web. ""The fundamental underlying technologies of machine learning and artificial intelligence are applicable to all manner of tasks,"" says Greg Corrado, a neuroscientist at Google. That's true, he says, ""whether those are tasks in your daily life, like getting directions or sorting through email, or the kinds of tasks that doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients face every day."" Corrado knows a bit about that. He helped Google develop the algorithm that Gmail uses to suggest replies. The company also knows the value of being in the health care sphere. ""It's pretty hard to ignore a market that represents about 20 percent of [U.S.] GDP,"" says John Moore, an industry analyst at Chilmark Research. ""So whether it's Google or it's Microsoft or it's IBM or it's Apple, everyone is taking a look at what they can do in the health care space."" Google, which provides financial support to NPR, made a false start into this field a decade ago. The company backed off after a venture called Google Health failed to take root. But now, Google has rebooted its efforts. Hundreds of employees are working on these health projects, often partnering with other companies and academics. Google doesn't disclose the size of its investment, but Moore says it's likely in the billions of dollars. One of the prime movers is a sister company called Verily, which this year got a billion-dollar boost for its already considerable efforts. Among its projects is software that can diagnose a common cause of blindness called diabetic retinopathy and that is currently in use in India. Verily is also working on tools to monitor blood sugar in people with diabetes, as well as surgical robots that learn from each operation. ""In each of these cases, you can use new technologies and new tools to solve a problem that's right in front of you,"" says cardiologist Jessica Mega, Verily's chief medical and scientific officer. ""In the case of surgical robotics, this idea of learning from one surgery to another becomes really important, because we should be constantly getting better."" Mega says the rise of artificial intelligence isn't that big a departure from devices we're used to, like pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, which jump into action in response to health signals from the body. ""So patients are already seeing this intersection between technology and health care,"" she says. ""It's just we're hitting an inflection point."" That's because the same kinds of algorithms that are giving rise to self-driving cars can also operate in the health care sphere. It's all about managing huge amounts of data. Hospitals have gigabytes of information about the typical patient in the form of electronic health records, scans and sometimes digitized pathology slides. That's fodder for algorithms to ingest and crunch. And Mega says there's a potential to wring a lot more useful information out of it. ""There's this idea that you are healthy until you become sick,"" she says, ""but there's really a continuum"" between health and disease. If computer algorithms can pick up early signs of a slide toward disease, that could help people avoid getting sick. But medical data aren't typically collected for research purposes, so there are gaps. To close those, Verily has partnered with Duke University and Stanford University in an effort called Project Baseline, which seeks to recruit 10,000 volunteers to give tons more data to the company. Judith Washburn and her husband, James Davis, have volunteered to be subjects in Project Baseline, an effort to gather a range of detailed data to characterize and predict how people move from health to illness.

She had heart scans, blood tests, skin swabs and stress tests — a checkup on steroids, if you pardon the expression. Her husband, James Davis, decided he'd give it a go as well. ""They were having trouble finding African-American participants at the time, so I was pretty much a shoo-in,"" he says.

The retired aerospace engineer also got an added benefit. The doctors diagnosed a serious heart condition, and Davis then had triple bypass surgery to treat it. The couple replies to quarterly questionnaires, a gizmo under their mattress tracks their sleep patterns and they each wear a watch that monitors their hearts. The watches also count their steps — sort of. ""They haven't quite figured out your exercise yet,"" Washburn says. ""In fact, I can knit and get steps!"" All this highly personal information goes into the database of a private corporation. Both Washburn and Davis thought about that before signing up but ultimately concluded that's OK. ""It depends upon what they're using it for,"" Washburn says. ""And if it's all for research, I'm fine with that."" Here's what makes Google's position unique. Some of the most useful data could be what the company collects while you're running a Google search, using Gmail or using its Chrome browser. ""As companies like Google and other traditional consumer-oriented companies start moving into this space, it is certainly clear that they bring the capability of taking much of the information they have about us and be able to apply it,"" says Reed Tuckson, a well-known academic physician who was recently recruited to advise Verily about Project Baseline. For example, people's browsing history can reveal a lot about what they buy, how they exercise and other facets of their lifestyles. ""We now understand that that has a great deal to do with the health decisions that we make,"" says Tuckson, who is on a National Academy of Medicine working group that's exploring artificial intelligence in medicine. He says Google needs to tread carefully around these privacy issues, but he's bullish on the technology. ""We should remember that the status quo is not acceptable by itself and that we've got to use every tool at our disposal — use them intelligently"" to improve the health of Americans, he says. ""And I think that's why it's exciting."" Tuckson isn't the only influential recruit to the effort. Verily recently brought in Dr. Robert Califf, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, as well as Vivian Lee, a radiologist who headed the University of Utah's health care system. Google hired David Feinberg, a physician who ran Geisinger, a major health care provider based in Danville, Pa. ""It seems like it was a bit of a war on talent right now between Amazon and Google and to a certain extent Apple,"" says Moore, the analyst. Google needs to build credibility in the medical sphere. ""I think Google is trying to have those people that can basically proof out what Google is doing and stand up and say, 'Yes, Google can do this,' "" Moore says. He also has his eye on what the company's investment means for the rapidly developing industry around health care and artificial intelligence. ""Anyone should take Google very seriously,"" he says. Some big players, like Apple and Microsoft, can hold their own. ""For other AI companies that don't have those resources, they're going to have to be very judicious in picking the niches they want to target, niches that are ones that, frankly, Google is not terribly interested in,"" Moore says. Getting the technology to work is just the start. The health care business is ""a very complex ecosystem,"" says Dr. Lonny Reisman, a former health insurance executive who now heads HealthReveal, a company that develops algorithms to help doctors choose the appropriate therapy. Google will need to answer many questions as it enters that landscape. Who will have an incentive to buy software based on artificial intelligence? Will it really save time or money, as advocates often assert? Or is it just the next new driver of health care inflation? ""There are all these competing forces around cost containment,"" Reisman says. It's not easy to balance innovation, access, fairness and health equity, he adds, ""so they've got a lot on their plate."" Google's Corrado says collaborations with academics and the health care industry are key for navigating this territory. ""A big part of the way that research and development should work in this space is by having kind of a long-term portfolio of technologies that you percolate through the academic and scientific community and then you percolate through the clinical community,"" Corrado says. For all the challenges of forging a new path into health care, Google has a potentially enormous advantage in all the data it collects from its billions of users. Corrado says the company is well aware of the sensitivity of putting that information to use and is thinking about how to approach that without provoking a backlash. ""It has to be something that is driven by the patients' desire to use their own information to better their wellness,"" Corrado says. In a world where people are increasingly concerned about how their personal data are exploited, that could be even more of a challenge than building the computer algorithms to digest and interpret it all.

"Keto Diet Not Effective, Causes Blood Sugar Problems In Women","Ketogenic diet or keto diet has been widely known for its benefits that could help shed the extra weight without requiring a strict and extremely limited meal. Some people also found the approach effective in improving blood sugar control.However, the trend may change in the future, particularly for women. A new study shows that females do not actually benefit from the high-fat, very low-carbohydrate diet. The findings, presented at the Endocrine Society's recent ENDO 2019 meeting in New Orleans, La., suggest that women are less likely to lose weight when following the keto diet. Researchers also found that such approach could cause problems in their blood sugar control, EurekAlert reported.""These results may help explain discrepancies in this diet's success rates across the sexes,"" Jesse Cochran, study lead researcher and a research assistant at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, said in their presentation. The ketogenic diet was originally introduced to help treat people with epilepsy. It limits consumption of carbohydrates and proteins, which encourage the body to switch from burning carbohydrates for energy to burning stored fat. For the latest study, the researchers analyzed how the diet affects both male and female mice. The team first fed the animals with either a ketogenic diet or a regular diet as a control. The control diet provided 7 percent fat, 47 percent carbohydrates and 19 percent protein by mass, while the keto meal gave 75 percent fat, 3 percent carbohydrates and 8 percent protein by mass. After 15 weeks, the female mice on the keto diet showed no changes in weight and had impaired blood sugar control. Meanwhile, male mice that received the same diet appeared with decreased body weight and maintained blood sugar control.The researchers also tried to remove ovaries of some female mice to see if estrogen plays a role in how the body responds to the ketogenic diet. Results show that the mice without ovaries and on a keto diet had lower body weight and body fat.""This finding suggests that postmenopausal women could potentially experience better weight loss outcomes with the ketogenic diet compared to younger women,"" Cochran said.Despite being conducted in an animal study, the team suggested people should consider meeting a doctor or an expert to discuss plans to follow a keto diet as the same problems found in mice may also occur in humans.",https://t.co/8ZcjNzO7ek,news
Black Twitter Savages DC Metro Tattletale &#39;Natasha the Snitch&#39;,"Screenshot: YouTube (CNN)Early Friday morning, a brave citizen named Natasha Tynes boarded the Washington, D.C., Metro with her pockets and soul apparently overflowing with an abundance of fucks that she intended on disbursing throughout the day. Upon boarding, our brave Natasha spotted a black woman dressed in a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority uniform, sitting alone, eating, which is obviously against the rules.Now, you or I might have seen this scofflaw and presumed something stupid, like: ""Well, maybe this black lady dressed in her work clothes is hungry. But Natasha is better than us. Plus, we must remember that she bore the burden of being heavy-laden with supplemental fucks that she wanted toâ€""no, had toâ€""donate to the masses. So at that momentâ€""in a situation when no one would have done soâ€"" Natasha decided to give a fuck.Natasha warned the black woman who was blatantly committing the terrorist act of chewing and swallowing, that her actions were ""unacceptable. But when the woman rightfully told Natasha to kick rocks and mind her own business, Natasha pulled out her phone, took a picture of the woman, and ran to Twitter:Now, you or I might not understand the impetus for Natasha's actions. That's because you likely aren't gifted with a mutated snitching gene like Natasha. She's kinda like an X-Man. But instead of the ability to control the weather, shoot eye-lasers or retract adamantium claws without a manicure, Natasha's tattletale has evolved to the point where she can summon anyone's superior at any time. Her X-Man Name is SpeakToYourManageria X.When the MTA replied, Natasha wouldn't let the shit go. She executed the full snitch, not some non-superhero regular people complaint. This is because Natasha is an Informer, which is like a Caucasian Transformer.Luckily a keen-eyed member of the Black Twitter Avengers spotted Natasha's dustup and called her out:Soon, black women on Twitter came to thank Natasha for her snitching powers. And when they found out that Natasha is an author who trumpets her minority status (I know, because her name is Natasha, I assumed she was black, too), of course, they got petty:Let this be a lesson to you all.If, by chance, you are ever tempted to call the authorities on a black person for doing something that absolutely affects no one, such as eating or inhaling oxygen, ask yourself these three questions:Why?No, seriously. Why?What the fuck, man? Why?And if you still don't have a reasonable answer, find some business of your own, mind it, tuck your auxiliary fuck back in your pocket and save it for a more appropriate time, when you are supposed to give a fuck.Of course, I searched Natasha's timeline and she doesn't have much to say about police brutality, racism or inequality. But a black woman eating?Oh, she'll runtelldat.",https://t.co/BngoeqsPny,news
Common blood sugar drug found to reverse heart failure in non-diabetics,"A drug used to treat type 2 diabetes called empagliflozin may also be an effective treatment for heart failure. The findings were revealed in a newly published study, which found that empagliflozin was able to reverse heart failure in non-diabetic animals. In addition, this particular medication was found to help the heart function more efficiently and produce more energy. The research comes out of Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, where scientists found the drug may be a heart failure treatment option for both diabetics and non-diabetics. Past research has found that diabetics — a population prone to developing heart failure — were less likely to develop the issue when taking empagliflozin.This drug, which is sold under the brand name Jardiance, was approved by the FDA in 2014 as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. The medication lowers blood sugar levels and limits sugar resorption in the kidneys. Past research involving the drug noted that type 2 diabetics who take the medication typically don't develop heart failure, prompting this latest research into its potential preventative benefit.To test this possible benefit, researchers induced heart failure in 14 pigs that did not have diabetes. Half of these animals were then treated with empagliflozin and compared, after two months, to the other half of the group receiving a placebo. Improved heart function was noted in all of the pigs that received empagliflozin, as well as lower levels of water in the lungs and lower heart failure biomarkers.The study found that in these treated pigs, the left ventricles in their hearts experienced stronger contractions, weren't as thick, and were less dilated than in the other group of pigs. As well, the hearts of these animals were a normal shape, meaning they hadn't stretched out or experienced other similar issues. The researchers also noted that these pigs experienced improved cardiac metabolism.The study's co-lead author Carlos Santos-Gallego, MD, explained:This study confirmed our hypothesis that empagliflozin is an incredibly effective treatment for heart failure and not only an antidiabetic drug … This is extremely important because heart failure is a disease with a mortality above 50 percent at 5 years. This study offers a new therapeutic strategy in heart failure, something badly needed given that there have not been new effective drugs for heart failure since the 1990s.The drug is now being studied in a clinical trial as a potential heart failure treatment for humans who don't have diabetes.",https://t.co/obFu4OU0y1,news
Weekday-Weekend Sleep Imbalance Bad for Blood Sugar Regulation,"Few things are more satisfying than sleeping late on weekends. But though the extra z's may improve your mood, they do not appear to improve your health. Because a new study shows that so-called ""recovery sleep"" cannot reset the body's metabolic clock…and may actually lead to some serious health issues.""Sleep loss can impact a range of physiological systems. It can increase our risk for cardiovascular disease, it can cause weight gain, it can decrease insulin sensitivity, so it can increase our risk of diabetes….Christopher Depner, an assistant professor in the department of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder.""And this can happen, depending on what you're looking at, this can happen as quick as one or two nights of not getting enough sleep.""A lot of us shut off the alarm on Saturday and Sunday. But we go right back to burning the candle at both ends once the workweek begins.""So we were really interested in how this sort of cycle of insufficient sleep, weekend recovery sleep, insufficient sleep, can impact your risk of obesity and metabolic disease.""Depner and his colleagues invited volunteers to a nine-day snooze-a-thon. One group was allowed to get a full night's sleep. The next was kept to just five hours each night. And the third group went back and forth, restricted to five hours of shut-eye during the workweek, allowed as much sleep as they wanted over the weekend, and then back to five hours for the last couple days.The results?""Well, the key findings from this study show that when we maintain insufficient short sleep schedules during a typical work or school week, we find that this leads people to eat more than they need and this leads to weight gain.""Ken Wright, professor of integrative physiology at U.C. Boulder. He's the senior author of the study, which appears in the journal Current Biology. [Christopher M. Depner et al., Ad libitum Weekend Recovery Sleep Fails to Prevent Metabolic Dysregulation during a Repeating Pattern of Insufficient Sleep and Weekend Recovery Sleep]So it seems a loss of sleep leads to a spike in snacking. But even more surprising, sleeping in on the weekend doesn't help—and even makes things worse.""We found that after the weekend, when they went back to getting insufficient sleep during the work or school week, we found that their liver and their muscle insulin sensitivity or blood sugar regulation was reduced. And this is not something we had found in people who maintained chronic insufficient sleep schedules. So it's possible that, yes, this is a worsening of the body's ability to regulate blood sugar for those specific tissues after the weekend.""So make a date with a pillow.

This Snail's Venom May Restore Healthy Blood Sugar Levels,"""Nature is the best medicine"" takes on a whole new meaning after scientists have discovered a type of snail that holds blood-sugar balancing venom.For years scientists have been trying to develop faster acting insulin for type 1 diabetics, and a study published on Tuesday in eLife found that three different types of cone snails all released fast-acting insulin venom to kill their prey.Insulin contains two segments called A and B chains. B chain is necessary to activate the body's insulin receptors and lower blood sugar, but in manufactured insulin, it slows the time for the diabetes drug to take effect. This can be a problem for type 1 diabetics who need fast-acting insulin.The researchers from the University of Utah Health studied the insulin makeup from the cone snails, and found none of them contained B chain. Interested in how this insulin could affect blood sugar levels, they injected the venom in type 1 diabetic zebrafish and mice and found that it not only lowered blood sugar quickly and effectively, it also activated the insulin receptors, which can also be found in humans.""We hope to use what we learn to find new approaches to treat diabetes,"" said Helena Safavi-Hemami, Ph.D., assistant professor of biochemistry and senior author on the paper in a statement.While more research is needed to develop faster acting insulin, the sequences found in the cone snail venom could be a strong indication of where to start. This news could have significant implications for type 1 diabetics who are insulin dependent and have to inject themselves daily.While type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, type 2 diabetes is often the result of poor diet and obesity which can cause the pancreas to eventually stop doing its job resulting in high blood sugar levels. There are many ways to lower your blood sugar naturally and they could save you from blood-sugar issues and type 2 diabetes down the line. Besides lowering your risk for type 2 diabetes, balancing your blood sugar is essential for things like weight regulation and mood balance.If you suspect you may have a blood sugar issue, you may want to do lab tests to check for signs your blood sugar is out of whack or your developing insulin resistance. Whether or not you know exactly how healthy your blood sugar levels are you can air on the side of caution and include blood-sugar balancing foods like healthy fats, matcha tea, and cinnamon in your diet.After this wild discovery, we're confident the development of new insulin drugs isn't moving at a snail's pace (sorry).",https://t.co/XlQ3Ur1F6I,news
Blood sugar drug could slash kidney failure risk in diabetes,"Canagliflozin, is a drug that was found to drastically lower the risk of kidney failure in individuals who have type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. The researchers have announced that the results came from a clinical trial that involved 4,401 people across 34 countries and highlighted a more effective way to protect patients against the severe diabetes complication. Apart from protecting the kidneys, the drug was also found to reduce the risk of suffering severe cardiovascular issues.It is noticed that diabetes leads to potentially life-threatening health problems that include heart attack , kidney disease, stroke and even death. The medication that is known as Canagliflozin has already been used to help protect patients who have both type 2 diabetes and heart disease from suffering serious cardiac events as well. It is also prescribed to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetics. Both the uses that include lowering blood glucose levels and reducing cardiovascular risk have been approved by the FDA.The results from the clinical trial involving the drug and its protective effect against kidney disease, underscores another potential benefit offered by it. The effectiveness of the drug for protecting against kidney failure in diabetes was compared to the currently accepted therapy which is called as rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade. The patients who were given the canagliflozin were found to be 30 percent less likely to develop kidney failure or die from a renal failure or cardiovascular disease.When kidney complications were specifically observed, trial patients who received the drug were 34 percent less likely to experience kidney failure or die from it. Moreover, the risk of being hospitalized for heart failure or dying from cardiac issues, dropped by 31 percent. The results have come out at a critical time as the cases of type 2 diabetes are expected to hit 510 million by 2030 which could be a 20 percent increase from the current levels.Photo Credits: Pixabay",https://t.co/S7I5k2XDI1,news
"Study finds diabetes drug may prevent, slow kidney disease","(AP) — A drug that's used to help control blood sugar in people with diabetes has now been shown to help prevent or slow kidney disease, which causes millions of deaths each year and requires hundreds of thousands of people to use dialysis to stay alive.Doctors say it's hard to overstate the importance of this study, and what it means for curbing this problem, which is growing because of the obesity epidemic.The study tested Janssen Pharmaceuticals' drug Invokana. Results were discussed Sunday at a medical meeting in Australia and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.About 30 million Americans and more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes , and most cases are Type 2, the kind tied to obesity. It occurs when the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, which turns food into energy.This can damage the kidneys over time, causing disease and ultimately, failure. In the U.S., it's responsible for nearly half a million people needing dialysis, and for thousands of kidney transplants each year.Some blood pressure drugs lower this risk but they're only partially effective. The new study tested Invokana, a daily pill sold now to help control blood sugar, to see if it also could help prevent kidney disease when added to standard treatments.For the study, about 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease from around the world were to be given Invokana or dummy pills. Independent monitors stopped the study early, after 4,400 people had been treated for about 2.5 years on average, when it was clear the drug was helping.Those on the drug had a 30% lower risk of one of these problems — kidney failure, need for dialysis, need for a kidney transplant, death from kidney- or heart-related causes, or other signs that kidneys were failing.For every 1,000 people taking the drug for 2.5 years, there would be 47 fewer cases of one of these problems, researchers estimate.Rates of serious side effects were similar in the drug and placebo groups including leg, foot or toe amputations, a concern raised by a previous study of Invokana. One side effect, when the body can't produce enough insulin, was more frequent among those on Invokana but rare overall.Janssen, which is part of Johnson &amp; Johnson, sponsored the study and many authors work or consult for the company. The drug costs about $500 a month in the U.S. Out-of-pocket costs for patients may be different, depending on insurance.The importance of this large and well-done study ""cannot be overstated,"" Drs. Julie Ingelfinger and Clifford Rosen, editors at the medical journal, wrote in an accompanying article.In recent years, several studies have found that Invokana and some similar drugs can lower heart risks.

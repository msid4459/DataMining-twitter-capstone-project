Exercise and diabetes,"How many times have you thought that you really need to make a plan and start working out seriously and consistently? Does this seem familiar?Fret not, you are not alone. Procrastination is an art that is practiced by people across the world, irrespective of colour, creed, caste, medical conditions...you get the picture, don't you? I even sprinkled a little bit of it into writing my blog, after all what is life without some well earned stress and the dark clouds of looming deadlines?We all have at least a vague idea that exercise is good for us. What is missing then? Why are we not exercising like we should? It is not like we needed any more motivation to work out (motivation is available by the quintals on our Instagram feeds, the Bikram Yoga YouTube channel you just subscribed to and hey, even our very own Type One Run Pune group!) but here is a friendly and precise reminder on why exercise is the best for anyone, but more so for us type 1 diabetics : Helps stay fit and manage weightIn the modern world, a lot of us have sedentary lifestyles and the combination of unhealthy foods and the lack of exercise is brewing the perfect storm. A big chunk of the population are already overweight or even obese. While earlier T1 and T2 were two distinctly different diabetes disorders, now things have changed. With the increase in body weight and insulin resistance, these days Double Diabetes is a raging epidemic that T1s are at a risk for. Exercise is an important key to weight management and it helps tone and sculpt your muscles as well.2. Makes us happier When we exercise, the body releases chemicals called endorphins that are responsible for the legendary 'exercise high' (runner's high or post workout high) which is the feeling of being on top of the world. Usually, people with chronic health problems are three times more likely to develop depression than people without it. Exercise is a feel good factor - it eliminates stress, makes us sleep better and boosts self confidence. Read more about acknowledging the importance of mental health in T1D management here.Exercise is a potent anti depressant. And it is free!3. Prevents lifestyle diseases Frequent and regular exercise boosts the immune system and is known to prevent or delay the onset of a host of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, dementia and Alzheimer's. Exercise slows down the process of ageing and undoubtedly improves general well being.Remember, exercise is a celebration of what your body can do, not a punishment for what you ate4. It is fun What can be more fun that getting together with friends and playing volleyball on the beach or just plugging in your ear phones and heading out for a jog? Exercise can be a social activity and a way to catch up with others who have the same exercise goals as you or it could also be about giving yourself some much needed 'me-time' and disconnecting with the rest of the world for a while. It gives you a chance to relax, enjoy the outdoors and feel good about yourself.With friends at the Medtronics Global Heroes Programme in Minnesota5. Improves insulin sensitivity Exercise is one the best ways to combat insulin resistance and improve insulin sensitivity. If I don't exercise for over 3-4 days, my insulin sensitivity takes a hit, however little. When I do exercise regularly, I definitely need lesser insulin.Now you know exactly why exercise is a good thing and there's oodles of inspiration, so what stops you from heading out of the door? To rephrase a popular brand tag lineJust do it. Then do it again and again and again..And if that is not motivation enough..So is that it? Are we done and good to go? Of course not. Type 1 diabetes adds a nice creamy layer of sweet complexity sprinkled with a healthy dose of unpredictability to a lot of things, exercise included. If you have not realized already, blood sugars react differently to different types of exercise. Wait, are there different types of exercise?Aerobic ExerciseWhat is it? Usually performed for longer periods of time, aerobic exercises are usually low to moderate intensity (steady state cardio) and they build endurance.What does it include? Walking, running, jogging, skipping, cycling, Zumba, aerobics, elliptical Effect on BG Aerobic exercises drop blood sugars generallyTip Always carry your hypo stash in your pockets, fanny pack or vest to keep yourself prepared. Read our guide for new runners here.Anaerobic ExerciseWhat is it? Usually performed for shorter periods of time, anaerobic exercises are more intense, they kick start your metabolism and keep it activated longer, increase VO2 Max and build muscle.What does it include? Weight lifting, HIIT, sprinting, power lifting, resistance training, explosive jumps, CrossFit, most forms of martial artsEffect on BG Anaerobic exercises spike blood sugarsTip Make a log and study the patterns of your blood sugars and do not be afraid to take a shot before or during a workout to arrest the sudden spike. I know it might seem counter intuitive but trust your research and reasoning. It can get very frustrating if you exercise and still spike. I take a shot midway through my MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) session at the 30 minute mark and still manage to have flat lines most days! It is not easy and it is not often that you succeed, but it is absolutely worth it.Other factorsA lot of exercises can be a mix of aerobic and anaerobic, such as football, where there are short bursts of energy as well as need for prolonged endurance. One needs to be careful while bolusing during such types of exercises to avoid hypos.Especially when doing a new form of exercise, test BG pre, post and during workout. There is NO way out, except testing repeatedly. Be aware that delayed or nocturnal hypos can occur. Do a 3AM test on active days.Do not exercise if your sugars are high, over 250 mg/dl. Take a correction dose, wait till you are back to normal range and then resume exercise.Be very careful with any active insulin before starting with exercise. The drop in BG can be harder and faster than normal when exercise is added to the mix, so be wary. However, in case of exercises such as swimming (especially for those on the pump), you could have a small snack + bolus before getting in the pool.Consider tweaking basal on very active days (some people even have different basal profiles for active and non active days)Adrenalin and stress can increase BG. If your T1 child is participating in a competition, or you are about to jump into the boxing ring you could definitely expect to see spikes.Happy working out!Read more post by this authorRunner | Co-founder at Club 1 Diabetes | Type One Run Pune Chapter Leader | Certified Diabetes Educator | Certified Pump Trainer",https://t.co/TRXnCuOMLf,others
3 Reasons you need sleep if you want weight-loss,"When you think of weight-loss you probably don't think of sleep at the same time.The health and fitness industry will have you believe that your weight-loss progress hinges on a secret formula only they know. And guess what, you can buy it for a fair price!However, what if there is no secret formula?What if the missing piece in your weight-loss puzzle was quite simply, a good night's sleep.Best of all, sleep costs you absolutely nothing.Repeat the process consistently and you really could have found that golden nugget of the weight-loss strategy you've been looking for.Weight-loss and sleepAs we explore the relationship between weight-loss and sleep we'll take a look at why sleep is hindering your progress…And more importantly what you can do to take control.Poor sleep and hunger controlImage Credit – alexeyzhilkinSay hello to your hunger hormones Ghrelin and Leptin.Ghrelin is the one that makes you hungry….It's quite normal for Ghrelin to be released throughout the day. After all you need to eat.Poor sleep drives up the production of Ghrelin, and you start feeling more hungry than normal.Therefore, the likelihood of eating more also starts to rise.Now meet Ghrelin's hormone friend Leptin.Leptin has the opposite effect on your hunger, in that it acts like an off-switch.Poor sleep reduces the amount of Leptin your body produces which impacts your ability to feel full and stop eating.Increased Ghrelin and reduced Leptin makes weight-loss much harder than it should be.Research has even shown that restricted sleep leads to people eating larger food portions the following day.Along with larger food portions it's also thought that poor sleep triggers cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods with low nutritional value. This brings us to our next topic…Poor sleep and blood sugar levelsControlling your blood sugar levels is a crucial part of the weight-loss equation.After a poor nights sleep sensitivity of the hormone insulin which deals with your blood sugars is down regulated, therefore your ability to control your blood sugar levels is reduced.In response your body ramps up its production of insulin.Over prolonged periods of time high levels of insulin creates an environment where extra energy is readily converted into fat and stored in the body.Not only will a poor nights sleep hike up your insulin levels, it can also increase your cravings for palatable processed carbohydrate foods which reduce your body's ability to feel satisfied by the foods you eat. This is a common reason for overeating.If you're looking to generate weight-loss this is not a situation that will work in your favour.Poor sleep and the stress responseImage Credit – jcompPoor sleep drives up the level of your stress hormones circulating around the body.Whilst stress hormones are quite natural and also needed, there comes a point when too much can become a problem.Cortisol has been shown to play a big role in appetite with prolonged increases being linked to increased hunger.Increased accumulation of fat within the body, particularly around the waist-line is brought about by the combination of raised cortisol and insulin levels.Interestingly there are also links between increased stress and consumption of 'comfort foods', namely those that are high in fat, sugar and salt as they have been shown to trigger reward sensors in the brain and dampen our perception of stress. Unfortunately these highly palatable foods also drastically increase food intake which is a recipe for weight-gain.How to improve sleep qualityhttps://www.flaticon.comUse a sleep app to track your sleepGetting a clear understanding of how much sleep you get and the quality of your sleep is key. Without this information you'll always be guessing about the impact the other changes below are making on your sleep. Try using Sleepscore as a good free starting option.Set a bedtime routineGetting caught up in work emails or social media before going to bed won't do your stress levels any good.And we know what that means for your weight-loss progress too.Put your phone on airplane mode before going to bed and kick back with a book, preferably something easy to read, you don't need brain ache before bed!Reduce caffeine intakeResearch suggests the majority of us can only tolerate around 400mg caffeine each day, which equates to around 2 coffees.Anything above this will have a negative impact on your ability to nod off in the evening.Also, consider that caffeine has a half-life of around 5-hours which means 50% of the caffeine you consume will still be circulating around your body 5-hours after drinking it….try to stop drinking coffee and tea after mid-afternoon.You can learn more about how to reduce your caffeine intake in the Digestible Guide to Reducing you Caffeine Intake.Wear ear plugsThere's no fancy science behind this one, ear plugs simply block out any external noise and help you sleep instead of being woken up by whatever's going on outside.Reduce your screen time at nightBeing able to down-regulate and fall asleep is key to getting a good nights sleep. Our daily exposure to digital screens and the blue light they emit offsets our body's natural sleep cycle which makes it much harder to get quality sleep at night.Try installing F.lux software on your computer, laptop and smartphone to naturally dim the light of your screen when the sun starts to set outside.What next?",https://t.co/ODhSFrc3Mt,others

Diabetics get help from a common mineral,"(NaturalHealth365) A stunning 100 million Americans currently have diabetes or prediabetes – elevated blood sugar that can progress to diabetes if unchecked. But, thankfully, we have some great news – especially for diabetics.Many natural health experts believe that widespread deficiencies of an essential mineral – magnesium – are driving the skyrocketing national rates of diabetes. In fact, even the National Institutes of Health (NIH) warns that 'diabetes is frequently associated with a magnesium deficiency.'The fact is, almost half of all Americans are low in magnesium (and, for seniors, the picture is even bleaker – 80 percent of adults over age 70 are deficient). If you think you may be deficient in magnesium, keep reading to discover how restoring healthy levels – whether accomplished by increasing dietary intake, or taking magnesium supplements – can benefit you.Red ALERT: Low magnesium is bad news for diabetics and heart patientsMagnesium plays a vital role in over 300 critical functions in the body. In addition to synthesizing proteins and helping to metabolize blood glucose and insulin, magnesium also balances levels of other minerals such as calcium, potassium and sodium.Unfortunately, a variety of factors can threaten magnesium levels.Experts say that commercial farming practices have seriously depleted magnesium in soil, causing lower magnesium levels in foods (and decreased dietary intakes in general). Having a digestive disorder – such as Crohn's or celiac disease – and using certain medications, such as diuretics, can also contribute to shortfalls.Did you know? The liver is the most important detoxifying organ in the body. When the liver can't effectively neutralize and dispose of toxins, they accumulate in the body. Two essential nutrients for healthy liver function are milk thistle and glutathione. These two ingredients - plus much more – are now available in an advanced liver support formula. Click here to learn more.Magnesium deficiency, or hypomagnesemia, is medically defined as under 1.8 mg/dL.Symptoms of magnesium deficiency include weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, tremors, irregular heartbeat, anxiety and insomnia. High blood pressure, migraine headaches and recurrent bacterial and fungal infections may also be a tip-off to low levels of magnesium.Because insulin resistance affects the transport of magnesium between cells, diabetics are particularly susceptible to magnesium deficiency. Certain medications may also cause diabetics to excrete more magnesium in the urine.And, while many disorders – such as heart disease and osteoporosis – are associated with low magnesium, diabetes is the most common. In a sort of biochemical ""vicious cycle,"" magnesium deficiencies are a major cause of diabetes – and vice versa!Complications of diabetes can include heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, cataracts and amputations.Scientists agree: Proper levels of magnesium can LOWER the risk of insulin resistanceIn an Israeli study published in Nutrients in January 2018, diabetic participants received either 250 mg of elemental magnesium a day for three months, or a placebo.And the results were revealing.The patients supplemented with magnesium showed improved glycemic response, with decreases in insulin resistance. And, just to be clear: insulin resistance refers to any impairment in the body's ability to use insulin – the hormone responsible for the absorption of blood sugar and its conversion to energy.Specifically, magnesium supplementation improved insulin sensitivity by 10 percent – and reduced blood sugar by an impressive 37 percent.In addition, the magnesium group's HbA1c levels (a measure of long-term blood sugar control) sank from 8.32 to 7.96 percent.The researchers concluded that poor intracellular magnesium levels can cause insulin resistance – while higher magnesium levels are associated with greater degrees of insulin sensitivity.In other words, magnesium supplementation can help insulin become more effective in controlling blood sugar in diabetics.Additional study showcases role of magnesium in regulating blood sugar and triglyceridesIn an Egyptian study published in Medicine in March 2017, the participants were children with type 1 diabetes. (Unlike type 2 diabetics – whose bodies can still produce the insulin that manages blood sugar – those with type 1 diabetes manufacture no insulin at all.)The team first evaluated the participants' magnesium status, along with its relationship to glycemic control and level of fats in the blood. Children who were found to have low magnesium levels were supplemented with 300 mg of magnesium a day for three months.The researchers found that the supplemented group had significant reductions in HbA1c – which plunged from 10.11 at the beginning of the study to 7.88 percent by study's end.In addition, the magnesium group experienced decreases in levels of fats in the blood – along with a reduction in atherogenic (harmful) LDL cholesterol and an increase in protective, beneficial HDL.The team concluded that dietary supplementation with magnesium, in addition to conventional therapies, could play a substantial role in the glycemic control of type 1 diabetes – and could delay or even prevent diabetic complications.It's official: You can cut your risk of developing diabetes with 'the right nutrition'Studies have already shown a strong association between eating a magnesium-rich diet and enjoying reduced incidence of diabetes – with scientists maintaining that an additional 100 mg of magnesium a day can lower risk of diabetes by 15 to 19 percent.You can increase your dietary intake of magnesium by eating plenty of dark leafy greens, such as spinach and kale. Other good sources include cashews, almonds and other nuts; pumpkin and sunflower seeds; chickpeas; beans; whole grains and dark chocolate.Naturally, you can minimize your exposure to (magnesium-robbing) chemical pesticides by eating organic foods — whenever possible.The National Institutes of Health currently advises a recommended daily amount of 420 mg of magnesium for men, and 320 mg for women. In order to maintain healthy magnesium levels, your integrative healthcare provider may recommend magnesium supplements.Magnesium is available in a range of formulations, with many natural health experts advising magnesium citrate, magnesium glycinate or magnesium threonate as among the most bioavailable.Health tip: magnesium can be applied to the skin in the form of magnesium chloride oil – a good choice for those suffering from digestive disorders that impair magnesium absorption. This form also can help bypass the diarrhea that may accompany some forms of magnesium supplementation.Naturally, always consult a trusted physician before supplementing with magnesium. Taking supplementary magnesium can affect the balance of other minerals in the body, such as calcium.Bottom line, a magnesium deficiency – currently widespread in the United States – can clearly open the door to a range of devastating diseases. With simple dietary changes or appropriate supplementation, you can minimize your risk of ""running short"" on this indispensable mineral.Editor's note: The NaturalHealth365 Store offers the finest quality magnesium supplements on the market.

Julie Ingelfinger and Clifford Rosen, editors at the medical journal, wrote in an accompanying article.In recent years, several studies have found that Invokana and some similar drugs can lower heart risks. The new results, showing that Invokana also may stall or prevent kidney failure, expand the potential benefits of the drug.___Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Maqui berry extract lowers risk of diabetes,"(NaturalHealth365) Over 30 million Americans currently have diabetes, while 84 million more have prediabetes, or elevated blood sugar that can lead to diabetes within two years. Normally, we're told through the 'lamestream media' that drugs are the only way to properly deal with this issue. Yet, we know of many ways to stabilize blood sugar (without drugs!) – like consuming the maqui berry.This is an alarming statistic: According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a shocking 51 percent of all Americans 65 and older are prediabetic. Do all of these people have a diabetic drug deficiency? (of course not!)A 'pill for every ill' is not the answer. In fact, the best solution for blood sugar problems is to change our lifestyle and improve the diet. Let's see how the maqui berry is a real winner.Key point: Elevated glucose and insulin levels after meals can increase your risk of diabetes and heart diseaseInsulin helps transport glucose to the cells for energy production or storage. However, when the cells lose the capacity to respond to insulin, the pancreas reacts by producing still more insulin – which in turn can eventually trigger chronic degenerative conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, chronic inflammation, obesity and cancer.Blood sugar spikes, which can persist for two hours after a meal (or longer)0, can cause an inflammatory response – even in those who aren't diabetic. And the resultant damage to the body is widespread – spikes can cause cataracts and kidney damage, along with a stiffening of heart and arterial tissues that increases the risk of stroke, heart attack and heart failure.In addition, spikes can cause glucose to chemically bond with proteins and sugars in the body, a process known as glycation. Researchers have found that glycation accelerates the aging process.Did you know? The liver is the most important detoxifying organ in the body. When the liver can't effectively neutralize and dispose of toxins, they accumulate in the body. Two essential nutrients for healthy liver function are milk thistle and glutathione. These two ingredients - plus much more – are now available in an advanced liver support formula.

Most blood tests for diabetes only measure fasting blood sugar levels – which can allow the problem of after-meal blood sugar surges to go undetected.Underreported good news: Maqui berry extract shows scientific promiseIn a 2014 placebo-controlled study of patients with moderate glucose intolerance, researchers found that 200 milligrams of maqui berry, given half an hour before a meal of rice, caused insulin and glucose levels to rise more slowly, and to peak at lower levels.The maqui berry extract reduced glucose levels by 15 percent and insulin levels by 56 percent – impressive results that were achieved within the hour. Imagine if this were coupled with better food choices?!The researchers believe that maqui berry extract owes it powers to phytochemicals called delphinidins. These compounds promote the action of GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide, a hormone that delays stomach emptying, lowers post-meal glucose and moderates insulin spikes.A second study, published in 2016 in BioMed Research International, confirmed the blood sugar-stabilizing effects of maqui berry. A maqui berry extract called Delphinol, given an hour before oral glucose tolerance tests, significantly lowered blood sugar and insulin. The team theorized that the extract might work by improving insulin sensitivity.Another study showed that maqui berry extracts, given for 90 days, reduced A1c levels in prediabetics after 60 days. And, an animal study demonstrated that maqui berry extracts lowered fasting blood glucose levels so dramatically that diabetic rats reached values indistinguishable from healthy, non-diabetic rats.Researchers say: Maqui berries edge out acai berries for antioxidant capacityMaqui berry, scientifically known as Aristotelia chilensis and sometimes called Chilean wine berry, is indigenous to the temperate rainforest region in southern Chile. The berries' intense dark purple coloration is a testament to their high content of anthocyanins, natural plant pigments with strong antioxidant effects.In fact, maqui berries are considered by some to be the most antioxidant-dense fruits in the world, scoring an amazing 27,600 units per 100 grams on the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) Scale – a score that puts them ahead of acai berries.Their sky-high content of antioxidants hasn't gone unnoticed by scientists.In a study published in 2015 in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, researchers found that the maqui berry extract Delphinol reduced levels of oxidative stress in several groups of participants – including healthy adults, adult smokers and overweight adults.In addition to delphinidins and anthocyanins, maqui berries are also high in fiber and rich in the antioxidant vitamin C – along with the essential minerals calcium, iron and potassium.Eating maqui berries can support an ""anti-inflammatory lifestyle""Along with their antioxidant powers, maqui berries boast anti-inflammatory properties – that have been shown, in studies, to help to inhibit COX-2 – a pro-inflammatory enzyme.Maqui berries also show promise in lowering blood pressure, improving blood vessel function, and maintaining the health of arterial linings. In addition, they help reduce levels of harmful LDL cholesterol, and may even promote weight loss.And, for those concerned about dementia: Like anthocyanin-rich blueberries, maqui berries may also slow cognitive decline.Although fresh maqui berries aren't easily available, you can purchase them in dried or powdered form. Maqui berries are also available as a juice – making it easy to add more antioxidative punch to smoothies.You can also get the benefits of maqui berries in the form of an extract. Natural health experts recommend a formulation standardized to 25 percent delphinidins and 35 percent total anthocyanins.Simply put, after-meal blood sugar spikes – which often go undetected – can present a major threat to our health. Thankfully, the surprisingly powerful effects of maqui berries on elevated blood sugar make them an effective natural ally.Sources for this article include:LifeExtension.com NIH.gov NIH.gov NIH.gov CDC.govFood &amp; Nutrition Natural Health 365 Natural Health 365 is a premium source of trending and popular health-related news, science, testimony &amp; research articles on the most up to date and relevant natural health information.

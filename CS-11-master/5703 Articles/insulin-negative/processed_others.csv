Treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist diminishes the decrease in free plasma leptin during maintenance of weight loss,"We here show that a long-acting GLP-1RA inhibits the normally occurring increase in soluble leptin receptors during weight loss maintenance by 59% compared with a control group. As a result, levels of free leptin were higher in the GLP-1RA group, which may counteract the weight-preserving actions of the physiological leptin decrease during weight loss maintenance as smaller decreases in levels of free leptin would be expected to prevent the leptin-mediated appetite increase and energy expenditure decrease that normally occurs in response to weight loss.5, 6 For optimal hormonal response comparisons, we aimed at equal weight loss maintenance in the two study groups; this was accomplished by closely monitoring weight changes, and, in the case of weight gain, offering up to two low-calorie meal replacements per day. The two groups successfully maintained a 12-kg weight loss during 1 year although the GLP-1RA group was slightly more successful; the GLP-1RA group had gained only 400 g vs 2300 g in the control group 52 weeks after the initial weight loss phase. Our data indicate that the 43% smaller decrease in the free leptin level contributed to maintain weight loss in the GLP-1RA group, whereas in the control group, the weight loss was maintained by replacing one meal per day with a fixed low-calorie meal, thereby keeping the energy intake down.The soluble leptin receptor represents the main leptin-binding activity in human blood.9 High levels of soluble leptin receptor appears to be a mechanism whereby the appetite-inhibiting action of leptin is suppressed during energy deficiency11 as high levels of soluble leptin receptor concentrations seem to directly inhibit leptin effects.12 Lower leptin levels are associated with a higher risk of weight gain over 2 years in healthy young adults,29 whereas an increase in soluble leptin receptors has been associated with leptin resistance.11 Moreover, leptin receptor expression has previously been coupled to the appetite inhibition of GLP-1,22 and recent studies in rodents have shown that GLP-1RAs can restore leptin responsiveness.23, 24 Our study supports the recently suggested theory that leptin, rather than being an appetite-inhibiting hormone in times of nutrient excess, is an 'anti-fasting' signal. Thus, when adipose tissue is lost, but independent of the amount of fat mass in the body, the consequent decrease in free leptin levels signals for increased food-seeking behavior.5, 6This indicates that it is the size of reduction in free leptin, from before the weight loss to 52 weeks after weight loss, rather than the absolute post-weight loss values that control food-seeking behavior.We analyzed the relationship between maintenance of weight loss and change in leptin-related parameters and found that increases in leptin and free leptin index during the weight loss maintenance period explained 46 and 48%, respectively, of the variation in weight increase in accordance with the previous studies.5, 6, 8, 13, 14 However, only in the control group we found the previously reported relationship wherein increases in soluble leptin receptor levels correlated to decreases in weight.5, 6, 8, 13, 14 This indicates that liraglutide treatment uncouples the increase in soluble leptin receptors that normally occurs during weight loss, thereby preventing the decrease in free leptin and thus preventing the increase in food-seeking behavior during weight loss maintenance.In humans, the soluble leptin receptor is generated by proteolytic cleavage of membrane-anchored leptin receptors.30 The long isoform of the leptin receptor ObRb, which is highly expressed in the hypothalamus, is considered to be the primary signaling form of the receptor and soluble leptin receptor levels are related to receptor expression of the long isoform ObRb.31 Thus GLP-1RA may, via GLP-1 receptor signaling in the hypothalamus, interfere with mRNA transcription, translation or the cleavage of ObRb to soluble leptin receptors and thereby down-regulate the production of soluble leptin receptors.The 12% body weight loss during the weight loss phase led to marked decreases in plasma leptin and free leptin index levels and significant increase in soluble leptin receptor levels, confirming previous findings regarding the effect of weight loss on leptin activity.5, 6, 8, 13, 14 In addition, the weight loss led to significant decreases in blood pressure and fasting levels of plasma triglycerides, plasma PYY, plasma glucose, serum insulin, and an increase in fasting plasma ghrelin level.During the weight loss maintenance period, the fasting plasma glucose level decreased by further 0.2 mmol l−1 in the GLP-1RA group, in contrast to the control group where blood glucose concentrations increased by 0.3 mmol l−1 to the same level as before the weight loss even though the weight loss was maintained. In addition, the triglyceride level increased by 0.4 mmol l−1 during weight loss maintenance in the control group in contrast to the GLP-1RA group where the level remained stable after weight loss, perhaps explained by a GLP-1-induced reduction of the secretion of intestinal triglycerides.32 Furthermore, the GLP-1RA group had significantly lowered plasma glucose levels and increased serum insulin levels during the meal test after 52 weeks, in contrast to the control group, consistent with the glucoregulatory actions of GLP-1.17, 19, 33 In addition, all participants receiving liraglutide became glucose tolerant, in contrast to the control group where 10% remained glucose intolerant. This implies that weight loss maintenance with GLP-1RA may act to prevent pre-diabetes in obesity.The decrease in blood pressure during weight loss was not maintained during the weight loss period, but increased to the level before weight loss, even though the weight loss was maintained. Similar observations have been made in other studies34, 35 and indicate that the initial large reduction in blood pressure is a transient acute response to hypocaloric states and large acute weight loss. However, in the GLP-1RA group, only the systolic blood pressure reverted significantly, whereas in the control group, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure returned to pre-intervention level. Of note, a meta-analysis has indicated that in subjects with a systolic blood pressure &lt;130 mm Hg, as the participants in the present study, the effect of liraglutide on blood pressure is minimal.36PYY3–36 is a known regulator of appetite37, 38 and, interestingly, we found that the PYY3–36 meal response was significantly higher in the GLP-1RA group, although the endogenous GLP-1 production, as expected,39 was blunted in the GLP-1RA group. PYY is predominantly colocalized with GLP-1 and would be expected to be secreted in parallel with GLP-1,40, 41 but previous reports have shown that some conditions may favor release of one hormone over the other42 and that there may be cells that preferentially release PYY or GLP-1 rather than both hormones in parallel.43, 44 Our study suggests that the appetite-inhibiting effect during chronic administration of GLP-1RA also involve an increase in the plasma levels of PYY3–36.The administration of a relatively low dose of liraglutide (1.2 mg) helped in maintaining a large weight loss of 12% for 52 weeks. The benefit of the combined effect of weight loss with very low-calorie diet and weight maintenance with 1.2 mg liraglutide may be fewer adverse effects and less cost compared with weight maintenance with 3.0 mg liraglutide.18, 45The strength of the present study is that we were able to successfully maintain a 12% weight loss in both groups thereby being able to make optimal hormonal response comparison in elucidating the potential effect of GLP-1RAs on leptin activity. We were not allowed to buy or obtain placebo Victoza pens from the production company (Novo Nordisk), however, we hold it unlikely that there would be a significant placebo effect on direct leptin activity. We did not assess gastric emptying in this study; however, previous studies have indicated that the weight loss mechanism of liraglutide is mediated by the regulation of appetite signals and not delayed gastric emptying, as the effects on gastric emptying is subject to marked tachyphylaxis in contrast to the body weight-lowering effects.46, 47, 48In conclusion, administration of a relatively low dose of GLP-1RA successfully maintained a 12% weight loss during 1 year. The appetite-inhibiting effect of GLP-1RA may depend on the 43% smaller decrease in free leptin levels, predominantly mediated by a 59% smaller increase in soluble leptin receptor, and higher PYY3–36 meal responses may also contribute. Furthermore, the GLP-1RA group lowered blood glucose additionally during weight loss maintenance in contrast to the control group where blood glucose levels increased to the same level as before the weight loss even though the weight loss was maintained. Thus, weight loss maintenance with GLP-1RA may act to prevent pre-diabetes in obesity.",https://t.co/Oi7bPdBVd3,others
"Visiting Mexico, asking strangers: Diabetics scramble for costly insulin","Mike Lawson will never forget how he ended up in the hospital 12 years ago when he had to decide between making a $300 car payment or buying insulin. ""I made a stupid choice,"" said Lawson, an Oakland resident who has Type 1 diabetes. ""That month I chose to pay for my car payment and to ration insulin."" These days, the price of insulin skyrocketing, and he is stockpiling the drug. Through Twitter, Lawson recently connected with a stranger who said she had four leftover bottles after switching brands. The two exchanged messages and met near her San Francisco office. Letting insulin go to waste ""is almost like tossing gold,"" Lawson said. The price of three commonly used insulin products has increased substantially in recent years. From 2013 to 2019, the cost of NovoLog nearly doubled, going from $289 to $540 per carton, according to according to letters sent in February to drug manufacturers by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating insulin prices. Another common drug, Lantus, rose in price from $244 to $431, the committee said. (The drug's maker, Sanofi, says the numbers rose from $228 to $425 over that time period, but the amount paid to the company actually fell 25% after Sanofi paid rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.) A vial of Humalog, a third popular insulin drug, cost $35 in 2001 and by 2015 had risen to $234, according to the Senate committee. And so, worried about cost, diabetics such as Lawson are increasingly seeking new ways to get, give away or exchange insulin cheaply or for free. Some are using unofficial channels on the internet. Others are traveling to Mexico, where pharmacies sell some popular types of insulin for a fraction of their cost in the United States. Lawson, who now is able to get insulin for a moderate price through insurance even though he still seeks out extra, has also given away some of his insulin to local strangers in need, who find him through Twitter by searching hashtags like #T1D (Type 1 diabetes) and #insulin4all. For the roughly 1.5 million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, the amount of money patients spent on insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $240 to $475 a month, according to a January report from the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care data. And spending in 2017 continued to rise, experts said. ""The risk isn't only that people are being trapped in debt,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, tweeted last weekend. ""Americans have actually died from diabetic ketoacidosis because they had to ration or skip their doses. We need to rein in Big Pharma greed to save lives."" Many stories have emerged nationwide about people who, like Lawson, rationed or delayed buying insulin because they could not afford it, often leading to deadly and dangerous results. About 1 in 4 diabetes patients uses less insulin than prescribed because of costs, according to a 2018 Yale University study. ""It's not just anecdotal, this is relatively widespread,"" said the study co-author Dr. Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. ""There are lots of patients having difficulty affording their insulin."" But why is insulin, which is naturally produced by the pancreas and first discovered for medical use nearly a century ago, so expensive? The scientists who invented it in 1923 sold the patent for $1 to the University of Toronto for the purpose of making it accessible. But the way the drug is produced and delivered to the body has changed significantly since then. Insulin was initially isolated from animal pancreases, but today it is made by inserting the human insulin gene into bacteria, producing the insulin protein, and then purifying it. Insulin is derived from live organisms and put through a complex process to become a medicine — so it's hard for a competing drug company to make a generic version of it. A handful of drug manufacturers have essentially patented the processes for creating modern-day insulin products just enough to keep exclusive patents under their name, experts said. Only three drug companies sell insulin in the United States: Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk. ""Some of the insulins have dozens of patents on them even though the active ingredient patent has expired,"" said Jeannie Biniek, a health economist who co-wrote the Health Care Cost Institute report. ""There's a question of whether these additional patents are providing a justified return on the investment or, if at some point, they are just providing the company the opportunity to maintain a monopoly on the market."" And, as is the case with many prescription drugs, it's not clear how the ""list price"" of insulin — what a patient would have to pay out of pocket for it, if they do not have insurance — is determined because negotiations between drug companies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers about who pays what are considered proprietary. Drug companies say lowering the list price wouldn't necessarily lead to lower costs for consumers because part of the list price gets paid to pharmacy benefit managers. In recent weeks, amid growing pressure from Congress, the drug companies and some insurers have announced plans to make insulin more affordable. But they fall short of many consumers' expectations. Eli Lilly, which makes Humalog, announced in March it will offer a half-price version of the popular fast-acting insulin for $137 per vial, but has not said when it will be available. A Lilly spokesman said the company also offers a free hotline that consumers can call for information about out-of-pocket reductions at the pharmacy and clinics where donated insulin is available. In April, hours before Sanofi executives were set to testify before a congressional committee on rising insulin prices, the company announced it will sell its insulin products for a fixed price of $99 a month, for up to 10 vials or boxes of insulin pens, to patients paying with cash. Patients who have commercial health insurance are eligible for co-pay cards that may lower their out-of-pocket expenses, a Sanofi spokesman said. Last year, 246,000 people used the co-pay cards and paid nothing or $10 a month for their Sanofi insulin, he said. Sanofi also provides free insulin for low-income uninsured patients who make about $30,000 a year or less. Novo Nordisk has provided free insulin to tens of thousands of uninsured people with diabetes since 2003 and spends $200 million each year on co-pay assistance to patients with commercial health plans. ""We know how challenging it is for a growing number of Americans with diabetes to afford their medicines, including the ones we make,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesman said. ""As a company focused on improving the lives of people with diabetes, this is not acceptable."" Cigna and Express Scripts, which recently merged, announced that they would cap out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $25 a month for patients whose pharmacy plans are managed by Express Scripts. Up to 700,000 people who are on employer-sponsored plans are eligible to receive this benefit if their employer decides to opt in. ""I'm glad to see the mounting pressure and public outcry are having an impact in Lilly releasing this generic and Cigna capping spending, but that's not enough,"" said Lipska, of Yale. ""Those are Band-Aid solutions that don't resolve the underlying issue of very high prices for these insulins."" Indeed, the discount and savings programs aren't reaching everyone. Sabella Larkin of San Diego said she has had to buy insulin in Mexico three times — once in Tijuana and twice in Rosarito. The first time was several years ago, when she was a college student in Texas, while working full time at a tanning salon and struggling to pay her bills. Her insurance at the time wouldn't cover an insulin refill until a certain date, and she couldn't wait. One of her customers at the salon lent her $200 to buy an insulin pen. ""Two weeks later when I got paid, I tried to reimburse her and she said no,"" said Larkin, 28. ""Being in that situation, that's when I went to Mexico and happened to see the insulin I take. It was only $20. I literally cried."" Larkin said she has purchased both NovoLog and Lantus in Mexico for $20 to $25, for the same amount of insulin that would have cost her hundreds of dollars at U.S. pharmacies. ""It was life changing,"" she said. ""It was this added security across the border."" Catherine Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Diabetes Claims and Compensation,"Diabetes Claims and CompensationOur friendly team of specialist lawyers at Medical Solicitors are experienced in acting for clients with a diabetes negligence claims. Diabetes compensation can be claimed where there has been delayed diagnosis of diabetes or where diabetes treatment has fallen below a reasonable standard to the extent that it is considered to amount to actual Medical Negligence. Do contact our friendly team of specialist lawyers at Medical Solicitors. We conduct most of our Clinical and Medical Negligence claims under 'No Win, No Fee' agreements, also known as Conditional Fee Agreements. So, our clients do not have to worry about how they can possibly afford to pay for the cost of diabetes compensation claims. You have nothing to lose in speaking to us.A diabetes compensation claim can be made when a patient suffers injury, or a worsening of their condition, because of negligent failure to manage diabetes reasonably, or the failure to diagnose diabetes promptly.Failings can happen because a GP misdiagnose, or fail to take heed of their patient's worsening symptoms. Doctors can also overlook requesting tests to investigate, or fail to refer a patient to a Physician. Sometimes, care under a Physician is lacking, but we have also handled cases where there was poor communication between a GP practice and a Hospital, leading to patients being neglected.In the most severe cases, a patient can lose their eyesight, or a limb (through having to have an amputation), or lose a kidney. Clearly, such severe injuries have permanent life-changing consequences. Victims of this type of medical negligence for failure to manage diabetes will need compensation to help them to cope for the rest of their lives.Tragically, a teenage girl lost her life to diabetes when she was given sleeping tablets by her GP, instead of diabetes being diagnosed. Read more about her very sad case by clicking here.Figures provided by the NHS state there are 3.9 million people living with diabetes in the UK. That's more than one in 16 people in the UK who has diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed). This figure has more than doubled since 1996 when there were 1.4 million. By 2025, it is estimated that five million people will have diabetes in the UK.Clearly, the fact that people are living longer has contributed, and the rising population number. However, poor lifestyle choices- being sedentary and consuming processed sugar, etc are major contributory factors.Is diabetes curable?Unfortunately, once a person has developed diabetes, it is generally not a curable condition (some patients recover from Type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery). Some patients may find it goes into remission if they start to look after themselves properly, to exercise and to eat healthily and get to a healthy weight. However, for others, management has to be by either taking medication every day, in tablet form, or by way of insulin injections.It is extremely important that health care providers properly monitor patients who are clearly at risk of developing diabetes, and those who have already been diagnosed. This is because the condition of diabetes can worsen, leading to more aggressive treatment being required (such as moving from diet control, to diet control and tablets, or moving from tablets to injections) and failure to pick up on this can have the most serious consequences, even sudden death.This is not scare-mongering. A high blood sugar level is actually poisonous to the human body. This can be particularly damaging to small blood vessels, for example, supplying eye-sight. Badly controlled diabetes can also lead to problems in the outer parts of a person's limbs, which is why diabetic patients are at higher risk of amputation than the ordinary population. This can start with a simple case of a cut, or blister that refuses to heal. This is because there if no longer a good blood supply to the outer extremities.We have acted in various cases where elderly patients have been neglected, leading to cuts, or blisters on their toes eventually turning into gangrenous wounds. The patients end up being rushed to a hospital when it is usually too late to save them from having to undergo an amputation of a toe, or even all of the toes and part of their foot. For patients suffering serious injuries, clearly it is important they have access to justice and that they do bring a diabetes negligence claim.Doctors are under a reasonable duty of care to pay proper attention to injuries suffered by diabetic patients and to take into account their risk of poor healing, to avoid further complications occurring.Practical adviceOf course, patients should also be educated by their doctor in how to monitor their own blood glucose levels. They should also be educated about the importance of monitoring their own blood glucose levels every day. If you, or a loved one, is diabetic, don't allow yourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security just because all seems to be well and then stop seeing to the daily monitoring. You will just never know when things may change, and by then it may be too late to avoid an irreversible injury. Such injuries can lead to an inability to drive, work, or even to look after yourself on a daily basis without care from someone else. No one wants to end up in that position!Please don't miss your regular GP check-ups and blood tests and please don't forget your annual visit to the opticians. Your optician should be advised about your diagnosis of diabetes and should monitor the tiny vessels in your eyes for any early signs of change that need to be acted upon to ensure your eyesight is preserved.Support for DiabetesQuite apart from diabetes compensation monies, you may need emotional, practical, or even financial support.

"Metabolic and physiologic improvements from consuming a paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet.","BACKGROUND: The contemporary American diet figures centrally in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic diseases-'diseases of civilization'. We investigated in humans whether a diet similar to that consumed by our preagricultural hunter-gatherer ancestors (that is, a paleolithic type diet) confers health benefits.METHODS: We performed an outpatient, metabolically controlled study, in nine nonobese sedentary healthy volunteers, ensuring no weight loss by daily weight. We compared the findings when the participants consumed their usual diet with those when they consumed a paleolithic type diet. The participants consumed their usual diet for 3 days, three ramp-up diets of increasing potassium and fiber for 7 days, then a paleolithic type diet comprising lean meat, fruits, vegetables and nuts, and excluding nonpaleolithic type foods, such as cereal grains, dairy or legumes, for 10 days. Outcomes included arterial blood pressure (BP); 24-h urine sodium and potassium excretion; plasma glucose and insulin areas under the curve (AUC) during a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); insulin sensitivity; plasma lipid concentrations; and brachial artery reactivity in response to ischemia.RESULTS: Compared with the baseline (usual) diet, we observed (a) significant reductions in BP associated with improved arterial distensibility (-3.1+/-2.9, P=0.01 and +0.19+/-0.23, P=0.05);(b) significant reduction in plasma insulin vs time AUC, during the OGTT (P=0.006); and (c) large significant reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides (-0.8+/-0.6 (P=0.007), -0.7+/-0.5 (P=0.003) and -0.3+/-0.3 (P=0.01) mmol/l respectively). In all these measured variables, either eight or all nine participants had identical directional responses when switched to paleolithic type diet, that is, near consistently improved status of circulatory, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism/physiology.CONCLUSIONS: Even short-term consumption of a paleolithic type diet improves BP and glucose tolerance, decreases insulin secretion, increases insulin sensitivity and improves lipid profiles without weight loss in healthy sedentary humans.",https://t.co/tdlUhG3KWQ,others

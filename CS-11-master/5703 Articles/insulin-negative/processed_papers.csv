The present study examines the effect of a ketogenic diet (KD) and fasting on Cirbp expression in the mouse liver. Chronic KD administration induced time-dependent Cirbp expression with hypothermia in mice. The circadian expression of clock genes such as Bmal1 and Clock was phase-advanced and augmented in the liver of mice fed with a KD. Transient food deprivation also induced time-dependent Cirbp expression with hypothermia in mice. These findings suggest that hypothermia is involved in the increased expression of Cirbp under ketogenic or fasting conditions.Keywords: Circadian rhythm, Body temperature, Ketogenesis, Torpor, Peripheral clock1. IntroductionThe central clock that regulates most physiological and behavioral rhythms in mammals is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus in the brain [1,2]. The mammalian circadian clock system consists of a master pacemaker in the SCN and peripheral oscillators in most tissues. Many studies at the molecular level have found that circadian oscillators in both the SCN and peripheral tissues are driven by negative feedback loops comprising the periodic expression of clock genes [1,2]. Peripheral oscillators are self-sustained and cell-autonomous because peripheral tissues maintain circadian clock gene expression even in vitro [1,2]. However, peripheral clocks are entrained to the central clock in the SCN by systemic time cues such as neural, humoral and other signals including body temperature [1–3].Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) has been identified as a protein that is induced by cold stress in cultured cells [4]. Levels of Cirbp expression rhythmically fluctuate in the mouse liver independently of the molecular clock, suggesting that changes in body temperature are involved in daily Cirbp expression [3,5]. Morf et al. [5] demonstrated direct interaction between CIRBP and transcripts encoding circadian clock proteins in vitro and revealed via loss-of-function experiments that CIRBP enhances the amplitude of circadian gene expression.Ketogenic diets (KDs) comprise high-fat with low carbohydrate and protein contents, and they have been used as an approach to weight loss for both obese and non-obese individuals. Such diets mimic the metabolic conditions of fasting or caloric restriction and are based on theoretical concepts of the effects of dietary component ratios on energy expenditure [6]. We previously demonstrated that circadian clock gene expression is disrupted in peripheral tissues of hypothermic mice fed with a KD (KD mice) [7–9]. We examined the temporal expression profiles of Cirbp mRNA in mice under KD feeding and fasting to elucidate the regulation mechanism of CIRBP expression in vivo.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsMale ICR mice (Japan SLC Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan) aged 7–8 weeks were maintained under a 12:12 h light–dark cycle (lights on at 0:00 and lights off at 12:00). A white fluorescent lamp served as a daytime light source.In the KD feeding experiment, mice were fed ad libitum for two weeks with a normal diet (ND) (CE-2; Clea Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) or with a KD (73.9% fat, 8.3% protein and 0.73% carbohydrates, w/w; modified AIN-93G; Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The proportions of calories derived from fat, carbohydrate and protein in ND and KD were 12.6%, 58.3% and 29.3%, and 94.8%, 0.1% and 4.8%, respectively. The mice were then sacrificed at 2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, and 22:00, and tissues were dissected, quickly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.Mice were sacrificed under food deprivation at 2:00, 8:00, 14:00, and 20:00 after an overnight fast.All animal care, handling and experimentation proceeded under the approval of our institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Permissions #2010–020 and #2012–020).2.2. Monitoring core body temperatureMice were surgically implanted intra-abdominally with data loggers (TempDisk TD-LAB, Labo Support Co. Ltd., Suita, Osaka, Japan) that were programmed to record Tb ± 0.1 °C every 10 min. The data obtained from each logger were analyzed using RhManager Ver.2.09 (KN Laboratories Inc., Ibaraki, Osaka, Japan). Hourly Tb data were averaged.2.3. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCRTotal RNA was extracted using RNAiso (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kits with gDNA Eraser (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). Real-time RT-PCR proceeded using SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) and a LightCyclerTM (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The reaction conditions were 95 °C for 10 s followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 57 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 10 s. Supplemental Table 1 shows the sequences of the primer pairs. The amount of target mRNA was normalized relative to that of 18S rRNA.2.4. Statistical analysisAll values are expressed as means ± SEM. Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Circadian rhythms were analyzed using the modified cosinor method (nonlinear least-squares (NLLS) Marquardt–Levenberg algorithm) [10]. We defined the function as f(x) = M + A cos(2π/T(x − ø)) and set four variables (M, MESOR (mean statistics of rhythm); A, amplitude (one-half of the total peak-trough variation); T, period; ø, acrophase) as the fit parameters. The circadian period (T) was 24 h under LD 12:12. Acrophase is expressed in hours elapsed from 0:00. The significance of the circadian rhythm was tested by the zero-amplitude test; P &lt; 0.05 was considered evidence of statistically significant rhythmicity for the given period of the cosine curve approximation. Data from cosinor analyses were compared between groups using Welch's or Student's t-test. P &lt; 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference.3. ResultsCore Tb fluctuated bimodally with a peak at early night (activity onset) and at the night-to-day transition under ND feeding (). Chronic KD administration significantly decreased Tb particularly at midday and late in the dark period, suggesting the induction of time-of-day-dependent torpor in these mice. Averaged daily Tb declined from 37.3 °C to 36.3 °C during two weeks of KD feeding.Circadian rhythms of core body temperature (Tb) in mice fed with a ketogenic diet (KD).

The abundance of Cirbp mRNA was elevated during late nighttime, which corresponded to daily torpor (). On the other hand, levels of Cirbp mRNA expression were continuously elevated in the heart (Supplemental Fig. 1), although the relative abundance of basal Cirbp expression was 5.2-fold higher in the liver than in the heart (data not shown).Temporal mRNA expression profiles of Cirbp and ketogenesis-related genes in the KD mouse liver.

Notably, the KD-induced expression of these genes and Cirbp was considerably enhanced during the nighttime.The MESOR of Bmal1, Clock, Per3, and Per2 expression and of the amplitude of Bmal1 and Per3 expression were significantly increased in the liver of KD mice ( and ). The KD advanced the acrophase of circadian gene expression by 3.6, 3.8, 3.8, 7.3 and 3.9 h for Bmal1, Clock, Per3, Per2, Dbp, respectively, in the liver.Temporal mRNA expression profiles of circadian clock-related genes in the liver of mice fed with a ketogenic diet (KD).

The amplitude of the circadian mRNA expression of Bmal1, Clock, Per3, and Per2 was unaffected, whereas that of Dbp was significantly decreased in the hearts of KD mice. On the other hand, the phase-advancing effect in the heart was relatively larger (by 6.2, 7.3, 4.8, 5.6, 6.0 h for Bmal1, Clock, Per3, Per2, Dbp, respectively) than that in the liver.Food deprivation notably and time-dependently reduced Core Tb ((B)). Fasting decreased Tb particularly at midday and late in the dark period as well as chronic KD administration (). Average daily Tb declined from 37.0 °C to 35.6 °C on the sampling day.

DiscussionMammalian peripheral circadian clocks are self-sustained and cell autonomous, although they are synchronized by the central clock in the SCN. Several circadian genes are expressed in peripheral tissues. Peripheral circadian rhythms are controlled by both local oscillators and systemic cues such as hormones, neural signals, and body temperature [1–3]. Originally identified as a cold stress-induced protein in cultured cells [4], CIRBP was later found to directly interact with circadian RNAs such as Clock, Per3 and Dbp, and to maintain robust (high amplitude) circadian gene expression in vitro [5].The present study showed that chronic KD administration and fasting induce time-dependent hepatic Cirbp expression with hypothermia in mice. Expression levels of Cirbp that were obviously increased late in the dark period corresponded to daily torpor, suggesting that the KD- and fasting-induced mRNA expression of Cirbp was a direct effect of hypothermia. To the best our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the induction of Cirbp expression in vivo.The magnitude and amplitude of circadian gene expression were obviously increased in the KD mouse liver. Daily body temperature fluctuations are presently considered as possible systemic cues for resetting peripheral clocks [12]. Hypothermia-induced CIRBP expression might be responsible for the KD-induced robustness of peripheral oscillators in the liver, because the depletion of CIRBP by siRNA results in a reduction in the amplitude of circadian gene expression in fibroblasts [5]. The expression of CLOCK is extremely reduced in cells depleted of CIRBP, indicating that CIRBP positively regulates CLOCK [5]. Temperature-dependent peripheral clock regulation might be mediated by CIRBP through the induction of Clock gene expression, because CLOCK completely rescues disrupted circadian gene expression in CIRBP-depleted fibroblasts [5].On the other hand, the magnitude and amplitude of circadian gene expression remained essentially unaffected in the hearts of KD mice, although Cirbp expression levels were significantly increased in both tissues. Systemic signals tissue-dependently regulate peripheral oscillators. Non-neuronal signals are sufficient to generate peripheral rhythms in the liver, whereas neural signals are critical for generating circadian rhythms in the heart [13]. Oscillators in the liver might be more sensitive to changes in Tb than those in the heart.The phase of circadian gene expression was obviously advanced both in the KD mouse liver and heart as described [8,9]. We demonstrated the phase-advancing effects of a KD on the biological clock that governs rhythmic behavioral activity as well as the rhythmic expression of circadian genes in mouse peripheral tissues [8,9]. Therefore, chronic KD feeding seems to affect the circadian phase of the central nervous systems. Several studies have indicated that caloric restriction or fasting induces a phase-advance and enlarges the amplitude of various circadian rhythms such as locomotor activity, Tb and circadian gene expression [14,15]. Fasting or caloric restriction induces time-dependent hypothermia in mammals [16,17]. Hypothermia-induced CIRBP expression might be involved in the phase-advancing effect of KD or fasting on circadian clocks.The present study showed that KD and fasting induce time-dependent hepatic Cirbp expression accompanied by hypothermia in mice. Further study is required to elucidate direct interactions between hypothermia-induced CIRBP expression and circadian clocks in vivo.Footnotes☆This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Appendix.

"Saturated Fat, Inflammation, and Insulin Resistance in PCOS","Abstract and Introduction Abstract Context: Inflammation and insulin resistance (IR) are often present in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Objective: We determined the effect of saturated fat ingestion on circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mononuclear cell (MNC) toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) in women with PCOS. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Academic medical center. Patients: Nineteen reproductive-age women with PCOS (10 lean, 9 obese) and 19 ovulatory control subjects (10 lean, 9 obese). Main Outcome Measures: LPS and TNFα levels were measured in plasma. TLR-4 and SOCS-3 mRNA and protein content were quantified in MNC from blood collected after fasting and 2, 3, and 5 hours after saturated fat ingestion. Insulin sensitivity was derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (ISOGTT). Androgen secretion was assessed from blood collected after fasting and 24, 48, and 72 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration. Results: Regardless of PCOS status, subjects who were obese had lipid-induced increases in circulating LPS and TLR-4 protein content compared with subjects who were lean. Lean and obese women with PCOS had lipid-induced increases in plasma TNFα and SOCS-3 mRNA and protein content compared with lean control subjects. Both PCOS groups had lower ISOGTT and greater HCG-stimulated androgen secretion compared with control subjects. The LPS and SOCS-3 responses were negatively correlated with ISOGTT and positively correlated with HCG-stimulated androgen secretion. Conclusion: In PCOS, lipid-induced LPS-mediated inflammation through TLR-4 is associated with obesity and worsened by PCOS, whereas lipid-induced increases in SOCS-3 may represent an obesity-independent, TNFα-mediated mechanism of IR. Introduction Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a pro-oxidant, proinflammatory state characterized by increases in reactive oxygen species, nuclear factor κB activation (NFκB) and cytokine secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) in response to glucose ingestion.[1–5] Insulin resistance (IR) is also a common finding in PCOS, resulting from defective insulin signaling that attenuates facilitative glucose transport.[6,7] Similar metabolic aberrations have been described in obesity and type 2 diabetes, and alterations in the gut microbiome have recently been implicated as a contributor to IR.[8,9] Obese individuals have a less diverse gut microbiota enriched with bacteria that favor an increase in fatty acid absorption.[8,10] Saturated fat ingestion, in particular, promotes alterations in the gut microbiome toward that observed in obesity[11] and increases gut permeability to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a fat-soluble component of gut-related gram-negative bacteria.[12,13] In fact, elevated circulating LPS levels have been observed in obesity and are associated with components of the metabolic syndrome.[14] LPS binds to toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), a pathogen pattern-recognition receptor present on MNCs in the circulation and MNC-derived macrophages within tissue[15] after delivery by LPS binding protein (LBP) previously intercalated to the membrane of these cells.[16] This phenomenon activates NFκB, the cardinal signal of inflammation that promotes transcription of TNFα, a known mediator of IR.[17–19] Increased TNFα expression upregulates the transcription of suppressor of cytokine-3 (SOCS-3), thereby creating a negative feedback loop that inhibits TNFα signaling.[20] However, SOCS-3 can also bind tyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor, thereby preventing insulin receptor substrate-1 from binding to the insulin receptor.[20] Insulin receptor substrate-1 is subsequently targeted for degradation causing truncation of the insulin signaling cascade and attenuated mobilization of GLUT 4, the glucose transport protein.[21,22] In a recent study, obese women with PCOS had an altered gut microbiome with a preponderance of gram-negative bacteria compared with that of obese control subjects.[23] A similar phenomenon was evident in lean women with PCOS compared with lean control subjects but to a much lesser extent compared with obese women with PCOS. Interestingly, circulating LBP is elevated in lean women with PCOS but similar to control subjects in overweight and obese women with PCOS.[24] High LBP concentrations enhance circulating LBP-LPS complexation, thus neutralizing LPS action by impairing its ability to access membrane-bound LBP for binding to TLR-4.[16] To our knowledge, the contribution of LPS- and TLR-4–mediated inflammation to the proinflammatory state present in PCOS has never been evaluated. Similarly, the role of SOC-3 in defective insulin signaling in PCOS is unknown. We designed a study to evaluate the effect of saturated fat ingestion on circulating LPS levels and the mRNA and protein content of TLR-4 from MNCs in women with PCOS. We also evaluated this effect on circulating TNFα levels and the mRNA and protein content of MNC-derived SOCS-3. We hypothesized that in response to saturated fat ingestion, circulating LPS and TNFα levels and the mRNA and protein content of TLR-4 and SOCS-3 are increased in women with PCOS compared with ovulatory control subjects of similar age and body mass index (BMI); and that these markers of inflammation are linked to adiposity, insulin sensitivity, levels of fasting lipids, and ovarian androgen secretion. Lean women with PCOS, representing the authentic syndrome, were evaluated separately from obese women with PCOS, who represented the superimposed effects of obesity on this disorder.",https://t.co/8DrI6EZk71,papers

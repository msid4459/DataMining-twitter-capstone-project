Diabulimia: NHS cash to treat type 1 diabetes eating disorder,"At her worst point Zohra Allana was told she was ""going to die"".The 25-year-old has diabulimia - when someone with type 1 diabetes deliberately doesn't take their insulin to control their weight.""I look really awful, emaciated,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, while swiping through holiday photos from last year.The condition isn't medically recognised, but now NHS England is putting just under Â£1m into two pilot projects to help people like Zohra.Type 1 diabetes is an irreversible autoimmune disease which requires constant care - people who have it need their insulin to stay alive.

I never want to go back to this"" Zohra was diagnosed with type 1 when she was 19: ""I was in my flat near uni and I just collapsed.""""So my flatmates took me to the nearest hospital and that's when they told me I had type 1.""I practically screamed the hospital down.""The leading type 1 diabetes charity JDRF estimates 60,000 15 to 30-year-olds are living with T1 in the UK.Diabetes and mental health experts believe up to 40% of those will at some point restrict their insulin over a ""fear of fatness"".""That first year I was coping well,"" Zohra remembers. ""Eating, injecting, going to uni - but when I realised I was putting on weight because of the insulin that's when it kind of slipped.""Eventually she was taking hardly any insulin.She remembers her holiday in Romania in October 2018 being more like a ""nightmare"", ""I couldn't control my bladder, I could barely walk and keep up with my friends.""""I just look extremely ill.""Just before that trip she said: ""It came to a point they wanted to admit me - they said I was going to die.""

That's where Zohra was admitted.Professor Janet Treasure is a consultant at SLaM: ""We're seeing more and more of it over time but because there hasn't been enough of a group power between diabetic and eating disorder clinics we have reached optimal levels of what to do about the illness.""The people running these pilots are hoping to change that. Image caption ""Every organ of the body can suffer,"" says prof. Janet Treasure Thanks to the treatment she received, Zohra did start taking her insulin.""Once you're eating and injecting you don't feel hungry - I hadn't felt full in a long time.""I was sleeping, I hadn't slept for four years.""In Zohra's case, you could see obvious weight loss, but experts believe it's hidden for thousands of sufferers.

"Insulin is a lifesaving drug, but it has become intolerably expensive. And the consequences can be tragic.","At first, it seemed like the stomach flu. Weeks before his 24th birthday in May 2015, Alec Raeshawn Smith was overcome by troubling symptoms. His body ached, his stomach hurt and he wasn't sleeping well. Laine Lu, a co-worker at his restaurant job, urged him to see a doctor. ""This is not normal,"" she recalls telling him. ""Go get checked out."" His mother, Nicole Smith-Holt, worried too. He called her when he decided to go to a health clinic near Minneapolis. He said, ""Seriously, Mom, I think something is really wrong with me."" Listen to this and other great stories from The Washington Post Magazine on the Curio app. The diagnosis was surprising: Type 1 diabetes. Alec's blood sugar levels were nearly twice the healthy limit. His family didn't have a history of diabetes, and lanky, 6-foot-3 Alec looked like the picture of health. At 23, he seemed too old for Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes because it often strikes children. But as Alec discovered, Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune response that can appear at any age. It is not preventable, and there is no known cure. At the clinic, a nurse practitioner discussed the potential complications of the chronic disease, including blindness, nerve damage, and kidney and heart problems, according to medical records. Alec came home with prescriptions for two kinds of insulin: One was long-acting; the other gave him short bursts before meals. He wrote on Facebook: ""Today a lot has changed. … I would never wish this upon anybody. So whoever reads this take care of yourself."" Even for his older sister, Brittany Smith, who is a nurse, the learning curve about Type 1 diabetes was steep. ""I didn't really have a handle on it,"" she says. Most of her diabetic patients had the far more common Type 2. Both types involve an imbalance of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels. For Type 1 diabetics, the body produces little to no insulin. In Type 2, generally, the body has become resistant to insulin's effects. Not all Type 2 diabetics take insulin, but all Type 1 diabetics do. Alec would need a steady supply for the rest of his life. What had been a carefree 20-something existence was now dominated by insulin injections, timing of doses and taking a blood sample four times a day to measure glucose levels. ""I know he'd get frustrated,"" Nicole says. Within three months, though, Alec had gotten his blood sugar under control. He maintained healthy levels as that first year wore on. He began dating Laine and worked as a manager at the restaurant where they'd met. Eventually, he moved out of his parents' home and into his own apartment on a tree-lined street near downtown Minneapolis. In 2017, as his 26th birthday neared, his mother had a new worry: He would no longer be covered by her health insurance through her job in the financial aid department of a community college. Nicole paid about $100 per biweekly paycheck for a family plan, and it had not cost extra to include Alec. With it, she says, he initially had been paying about $200 to $300 a month out-of-pocket for his diabetic supplies and prescriptions, an amount he could just afford. The restaurant did not offer insurance, and his $35,000 salary put him above the income limit for Medicaid in Minnesota. His mother helped him look for a health plan on the marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act, but his options were expensive. To keep going to the same doctors, she says, he was looking at paying about $450 monthly, in addition to a high deductible of more than $7,000, which would mean months of paying out-of-pocket for most of his medical care. He opted to go without insurance, forgoing that expense to focus on paying for his insulin and supplies until he could find a better option. What Alec soon learned was just how much his insulin would end up costing: more than $1,000 a month. The price of insulin — once modest — has skyrocketed in recent years, making the lifesaving medication a significant, even burdensome, expense, especially for the uninsured and underinsured. The costs are so heavy that they have driven some patients to ration their supplies of the drug in a dangerous gamble with life-threatening consequences. At the time Alec discussed skipping insurance coverage, he told his mother, ""It can't be that bad."" Within a month of going off her policy, he would be dead. Laine Lu, Alec Raeshawn Smith's girlfriend, had looked for prescription discounts for him; she eventually would find him dead in his apartment.

Erick Borrome shows a photo of his best friend. (Photos by Caroline Yang for The Washington Post) Insulin, in its various manufactured forms, has been used to treat diabetes for almost a century, since Canadian researchers isolated the hormone in a lab in 1921. Before their discovery, what we now know as Type 1 diabetes was fatal. Even after being put on starvation diets, patients often lived no more than a few years. The researchers who transformed diabetes treatment won the Nobel Prize, and they sold their patent to the University of Toronto for a total of $3. ""Above all, these were discoverers who were trying to do a great humanitarian thing, and they hoped their discovery was a kind of gift to humanity,"" historian Michael Bliss told The Washington Post in 2016. Soon, though, insulin became a commercial enterprise. By 1923, the American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly was manufacturing enough insulin for diabetics across North America. For decades, manufacturers improved formulas, first using animal parts, then producing human insulin using bacteria and recombinant DNA. The 1990s saw the advent of insulin analogs, synthetic drugs made to better mimic the body's own insulin production. Today, critics argue that the price of insulin has far outpaced any innovations. In the past decade alone, U.S. insulin list prices have tripled, according to an analysis of data from IBM Watson Health. In 1996, when Eli Lilly debuted its Humalog brand of insulin, the list price of a 10-milliliter vial was $21. The price of the same vial is now $275. Those costs can be compounded by the multiple vials that diabetics may require to survive each month. ""It's a very big problem,"" says Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. ""It's a tragic barrier to care."" The global insulin market is dominated by three companies: Eli Lilly, the French company Sanofi and the Danish firm Novo Nordisk. All three have raised list prices to similar levels. According to IBM Watson Health data, Sanofi's popular insulin brand Lantus was $35 a vial when it was introduced in 2001; it's now $270. Novo Nordisk's Novolog was priced at $40 in 2001, and as of July 2018, it's $289. In Washington, the soaring price of insulin has provoked bipartisan concern. Members of Congress are trying to parse the factors that have caused the spike. In November, a congressional caucus released a report on insulin, urging legislation aimed at lowering prices through increased competition and pricing transparency, among other recommendations. In June, the American Medical Association called on the government ""to monitor insulin pricing and market competition and take enforcement actions as appropriate."" Insulin, in some ways, serves as a proxy for the rising prices across the U.S. prescription drug market. On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump railed against high drug prices, and his administration has vowed to lower them, releasing a flurry of proposals in the past year. In the meantime, a portion of the more than 7 million diabetic Americans who take insulin are stuck with debilitating costs. Though most don't pay the full list price for insulin because of insurance coverage and other rebates, some do, especially those who are uninsured, underinsured or facing a coverage gap through Medicare. ""The most vulnerable patients are subsidizing the system,"" William Cefalu, the chief scientific, medical and mission officer of the American Diabetes Association, told a Senate committee in May. ""People should not have to pay significant high prices for accessing a treatment that keeps them well,"" says economist Rena Conti. At the same hearing, a father from Maine told senators that a 90-day prescription for just one of his son's insulins would cost him $1,489.46. That's with his high-deductible insurance. He testified that he has taken to buying the same three-month supply from a Canadian pharmacy for about $300 plus $50 in shipping. (It's technically illegal to import medication from other countries, but the Food and Drug Administration generally doesn't prosecute individuals if it's a short-term supply for personal use.) He is not alone in his dilemma: The website GoFundMe has thousands of posts with people pleading for help to pay for insulin. Patients who struggle to afford insulin sometimes ration their supply to make it last longer — a dangerous practice that can create disabling or deadly complications. ""It's very shortsighted to skimp on insulin,"" says Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist and diabetes researcher at Yale School of Medicine. ""In the long term, it's going to cost us much more."" Poor glycemic control can lead to blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart disease and stroke. In the short term, patients who stop taking enough insulin can lapse into diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition where blood sugars get too high and the body's blood becomes acidic. It can become fatal in just hours or a few days. At the Yale Diabetes Center, Lipska and her colleagues recently found that one in four diabetic patients reported rationing insulin because of the cost. Very few of those patients were uninsured, but their out-of-pocket expenses still created a financial burden. These patients were also, not surprisingly, almost three times as likely to have poor blood sugar control as patients who didn't underuse insulin. Alec's mother, Nicole Smith-Holt. Under her insurance, he initially had been paying about $200 to $300 a month for his supplies and prescriptions. Without insurance, he would pay more than $1,000 a month for insulin. (Caroline Yang for The Washington Post) Did Alec die because he was rationing? The answer may never be absolutely clear, but his family is convinced that he was skimping on his doses. He never told his loved ones that he was rationing because of the expense, but they knew that the disease and its cost wore on him. He had talked to his parents about searching for jobs that offered health insurance. Laine had scouted the Internet for prescription discounts. Alec vented to his best friend, Erick Borrome, whose wife, Arizbeth, offered to get him cheap insulin from a pharmacy in Mexico, where she had family and a vial cost roughly $50. She says: ""We had many conversations about the insulin and the cost. He was pretty worried about it."" But, she adds, ""he was too shy to accept help."" He never took her up on the offer. Nicole got the call that Alec had died on a Tuesday. It was Laine who found him. She hadn't heard from him since Sunday night, so she went to his apartment to check on him. He was on the floor beside his bed. ""I grabbed his shoulder, and it was ice cold,"" Laine says. ""I just knew he was gone."" Alec's funeral was held the day after the Fourth of July, his favorite holiday. Family and friends gathered at his parents' house in Richfield, a Minneapolis suburb, to shoot off fireworks in his memory. Those first few weeks were a blur, as Nicole tried in her grief to piece together the last days of Alec's life. The medical examiner had listed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the cause of death. By definition, he had died of a lack of insulin, but why and how did that happen? In speaking with Laine, Nicole learned that Alec had indicated he was running low on insulin before he died. That Sunday, Laine had suggested they go to a food truck festival, but she remembered Alec saying, ""No, I don't think I have enough insulin for that."" That night, he was tired and complaining about abdominal pains. Hearing this, Nicole deduced that those symptoms may have been warning signs of DKA. There were more clues: There was some healthy food in his fridge, but no stockpile of insulin. As Nicole cleaned out his cluttered blue car, littered with old prescription receipts, she started to cobble together just how much his insulin and blood sugar testing supplies cost without insurance or discounts. The total, by her count, was nearly $1,300 per month. That was roughly the same amount that Alec's local pharmacy tallied for me nearly a year later, using a list of his medications and medical supplies. ""It's very expensive to be diabetic without insurance,"" the pharmacist said. That $1,300 was almost $200 more than Alec's biweekly paycheck. Nicole now believes that Alec was rationing his insulin because of the cost. ""Based upon what he had left when he was found, we came to the conclusion that he had not filled his prescription, so he had to have been rationing for a short period of time,"" Nicole told me. ""We realized that he had been taking less insulin and less often than he should, trying to make it stretch until he got his next paycheck."" He was found dead three days before payday. No one can truly know what happened in those final days. Alec may not have realized that his condition was so serious, or perhaps he thought he would be fine, just as he had been when he was diagnosed. DKA creates confusion as it progresses, and it can progress quickly, shutting down vital organs. ""If I could go back in time,"" Nicole says, ""I would have found a way for him to not move out … so I could monitor this or see that he was struggling in some kind of way, and force him to take our help."" One afternoon, sitting at their dining room table, her husband, James Holt, recalled encouraging Alec to get his own place. ""I think back and regret that,"" he said, wiping away tears. In their search for answers, there was enough blame to go around. His family blamed the broken health-care system. They blamed unaffordable insurance and high out-of-pocket costs. They blamed a lot of things, including, in darker moments, themselves. But they kept coming back to the price of insulin. Why was a treatment that had been around for nearly 100 years so expensive? And what could be done about it? (Edmon de Haro for The Washington Post) Nicole hadn't known much about the world of diabetes advocacy before Alec died. But now she felt a budding activism as she encountered a flood of information and stories like her own online. Advocates were rallying around the hashtag #insulin4all, which the nonprofit organization T1International helped create in 2014 to raise awareness about the inaccessibility of insulin, particularly in developing countries. T1International's founder, Elizabeth Pfiester, an American Type 1 diabetic who now lives in the United Kingdom, still marvels at how much more affordable diabetes care is in her adopted country. ""It's really a shame that #insulin4all is needed as a rallying cry in the U.S.,"" she says. There are T1International activists like Hattie Saltzman, a college student in Missouri who went a year without buying insulin because she couldn't afford her monthly $550 insulin bill. Her father shared some of his insulin, and she got free samples from her doctor. At one point, she told me, ""I had rationed insulin so extensively that it expired. I didn't catch that until I went to the ER because my blood sugars were through the roof."" When the diabetic daughter of family friends died of cystic fibrosis, the family donated her leftover insulin to Saltzman. That got her through the year until she qualified for better insurance coverage. There are new cases all the time. In July, Long Island resident Doreen Rudolph tweeted about her young adult daughter's struggle to afford insulin: ""I just bought 2 vials of insulin for my daughter cost me $524. With a discount card. All I could buy. I left the pharmacy and sat in my car and cried."" Her message struck a chord: Within five days, her tweet had been liked 70,000 times, and her $8,000 GoFundMe campaign was fully funded. To buy insulin, Rudolph told me, ""We've taken out loans. We've borrowed from retirement. You think, 'Where else can I get it?' "" A pharmacist and a number of physicians told me about older insulins available from Walmart. The type of insulin first came out in the 1980s and now costs about $25 per vial. So-called ""Walmart insulin"" is a controversial solution for Type 1 diabetics, many of whom believe that older formulas are more likely to lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels. A few doctors echoed that concern. Yet it could still save lives. ""It's very good insulin,"" one physician told me. Another said, ""It's obviously better than nothing."" Researchers have found that these older insulins work just as well for Type 2 diabetics as pricier analog insulins, but some research shows a slightly better outcome for Type 1 diabetics on newer formulas. Many diabetics continue to hunt for coupons and discounts on high-priced insulins. Some doctors will give out samples to struggling patients. The constant search for more insulin can become all-consuming. ""I think about it when I wake up. I think about it when I go to bed,"" says Michelle Fenner, an #insulin4all activist whose diabetic son is 17. She worries about what will happen when he is a young adult and on his own. ""There is no way he can pay what I do,"" she says. Eli Lilly, which hasn't raised its insulin prices since May 2017, declines to discuss its pricing strategies in general. Asked for comment, it offered a statement: ""Some people pay too much for insulin at the pharmacy, and there are several reasons — including high deductible insurance plans that require people to pay thousands of dollars in medical bills before coverage is triggered. We're focused on finding solutions to the problem."" In August, the company started the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, a help line to ""assist people who need help paying for their insulin."" Fenner said a coupon she received from the help line dropped the monthly cost of one of her son's insulins from $900 to $95. It's an incredible boon, but she already worries how long Eli Lilly will keep the savings going. According to the American Diabetes Association, these kinds of measures are just a stopgap: The organization's June 2018 report concluded that corporate patient assistance programs are ""not deemed to be a long-term or comprehensive answer to the rising cost of insulin for the vast majority of people with diabetes."" Several people, including Fenner, described insulin as being like oxygen: Scavenging for it invokes a primal fear, like the gasp you make just before you run out of air.

(Photos by Caroline Yang for The Washington Post) In early May, 10 months after Alec died, Nicole flew to Indianapolis to attend a shareholder meeting at Eli Lilly headquarters. Her trip had been coordinated in part by T1International. Before the meeting, a small band of activists gathered outside. One held a neon-pink poster that read: ""Your insulin is a life saver. Your prices are poison."" Camera crews set up on a street corner. For more than half an hour, Nicole answered the same questions from reporters. Why are you here? What do you want from Eli Lilly? She told them she was there for Alec. ""I feel like I am leaving a legacy for him,"" she said. ""That's what is really important to me. I don't want any other person to die the way that he did. If I can prevent it, that's what I'm here to do."" Nicole wanted pharmaceutical companies to start by being more transparent about their prices — to disclose how much it costs to manufacture a vial of insulin and what the profit margin on each vial is. Ultimately, she wanted them to reduce the price. ""They're going to tell you it's complicated or they can't share that information with you,"" she said to a reporter. ""It's not all that complicated. They're choosing to make it complicated. It's just plain greed."" The rising prices from Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk have raised suspicions. The companies appear to have increased them in lockstep over a number of years, prompting allegations of price fixing. All three companies denied these charges when I contacted them. (In 2010, Mexico fined Eli Lilly and three Mexican companies for price collusion on insulin, an allegation Eli Lilly also denied.) In the United States, a federal prosecutor and at least five state attorneys general are currently investigating the companies' pricing practices, according to Kaiser Health News. In October, Minnesota became the first state to sue the companies over insulin prices. And in January 2017, potential class-action lawsuits alleging price fixing by the three companies began making their way through the courts on behalf of diabetics. The companies denied the suits' allegations. There is also another, less known corporate entity in the mix: pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which include Express Scripts, OptumRx and CVS Health; all are now named in lawsuits on high insulin prices, but these companies also deny any wrongdoing. PBMs manage the prescription drug benefits that are part of insurance plans, working with pharmaceutical companies to negotiate discounts on behalf of insurance providers. ""Every time a PBM extracts a deeper discount, an insulin manufacturer has the incentive to take a price increase to quote 'make themselves whole,' "" says Rena Conti, a health economist at Boston University. That's probably one reason why, even as Eli Lilly's list price for Humalog insulin has increased by 175 percent since 2009, the company maintains that its net price — the amount the company earns after rebates, discounts and fees — has remained steady. Both drug companies and PBMs play a role in escalating drug prices. ""It's almost like Kabuki theater where one guy points to the other guy and says, 'It's not me, it's him,' "" says Jing Luo, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and a faculty member at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital who studies insulin pricing. These corporate entities are powerful special interests. In 2017, the pharmaceutical and health product industry — which includes drug companies and PBMs — spent nearly $280 million on lobbying, the biggest spender by far of 20 top industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Even some patient advocacy organizations, like the American Diabetes Association, receive millions in funding from pharmaceutical companies. The industry also has a revolving door to government. Alex Azar, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, was the president of Eli Lilly's U.S. division until 2017. Under his watch, the price of the company's analog insulin doubled. Now he is tasked with overseeing the government's plan to lower those same prices. At Eli Lilly, Nicole met with Mike Mason, the vice president of U.S. Lilly's diabetes division. The company declined to make Mason available for an interview for this article, but Nicole says he seemed compassionate. She held a photo of Alec during the meeting and placed it on the table in front of her while she read a statement. ""Profits should never come before the lives of people,"" she told Mason and the other representatives in the room, before asking them to remember her family's grief. She struggled to maintain her composure, she told me later, but when she brought up ""corporate greed"" with Mason, she says, ""I stopped and looked him dead in the face. He looked away."" ""We've taken out loans. We've borrowed from retirement. You think, 'Where else can I get it?' "" says Doreen Rudolph of the struggle to afford insulin for her daughter. On May 11, four days after Nicole's trip to Eli Lilly, President Trump and Azar stood in the White House Rose Garden to unveil ""American Patients First,"" the administration's ""blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs."" The president told the crowd, ""We will have tougher negotiation, more competition and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter. And it will start to take effect very soon."" The blueprint includes more than 50 proposals. ""There is not a single silver bullet that's going to reduce drug prices across the board,"" says Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor and drug-pricing researcher who is a colleague of Luo's at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Some of the proposals are nonstarters, he argues, such as punishing other countries for the low prices they pay on drugs. (Americans pay more for drugs than any other nationality, but the governments of many other developed countries regulate drug prices, which keeps them lower.) ""A better solution would be to focus on what makes our pharmaceutical market inefficient,"" Kesselheim says. ""Focusing on this concept of foreign freeloading is, I think, a political distraction."" For Conti, the Boston University economist, the administration's blueprint doesn't go far enough in addressing insurers. To guarantee that ""real people pay lower prices"" at the pharmacy, the first thing she would do is eliminate insurance plans that allow large out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs — including the kind of high-deductible plan that Alec opted not to take. ""It's insurance principles 101,"" Conti says. ""People should not have to pay significant high prices for accessing a treatment that keeps them well."" The blueprint overall is just that: a starting framework. One promising idea calls for increased pricing transparency, a popular idea among insulin-access activists that has also been gaining ground in state legislatures. The blueprint also recommends bringing more generic drugs onto the market. Right now, the United States has two relatively new ""follow-on"" insulins, which are similar to generics, but they are only marginally cheaper. Some experts say more competition is needed to lower prices. In December, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement on policies that will put more generics on the U.S. market, including for insulin starting in 2020, as part of a transition that was written into the Affordable Care Act. ""We've heard frequent reports of patients rationing insulin, and in some cases dying because they can't afford the injections they need to survive,"" the statement read. ""These tragic stories aren't isolated occurrences. And they're not acceptable for a drug that's nearly a century old."" Trump has said that drug companies are ""getting away with murder,"" and he has singled them out on Twitter, but some experts say his administration's blueprint takes a harder line on PBMs than it does on pharmaceutical companies. And though Trump pledged in late May that drug manufacturers would lower their prices — and a few voluntarily did so — none lowered the price of insulin. In July, Novo Nordisk raised its list prices on two insulins another 5 percent. Alec's family, from left: Alexis Holt, James Holt, Nicole Smith-Holt, Brittany Smith and Jamisen Holt at their home in Richfield, Minn. Nicole Smith-Holt is working to get drug manufacturers to lower the price of insulin. (Caroline Yang for The Washington Post) May through July would bring some of the hardest days, but Nicole and James pressed on, hosting a rally for affordable insulin at the Minnesota state Capitol. Their story reached the ears of lawmakers: In the state legislature, the Alec Smith Emergency Insulin Act was introduced to provide insulin to those in need. It didn't come up for a vote, but they laminated a copy of the bill's text anyway. On her first Mother's Day without Alec, Nicole spent hours planting a memorial garden in a corner of her yard. A week later, on May 20, the family invited loved ones over to visit the space and commemorate Alec's first ""heavenly birthday."" Brittany had driven a half-hour across the Wisconsin state line to buy fireworks. In the kitchen, there were hamburgers and hot dogs waiting. There was even a cake: store-bought with thick white frosting — the kind a diabetic might be told to avoid. In green letters, it read: ""Forever 26."" The long Minnesota winter had given way to one of those perfect days, 70 degrees and sunny. James fired up the grill, and music piped through speakers. The Borromes arrived, and so did Laine, who dabbed her eyes with a napkin as they shared stories about Alec. For Nicole, it was too much at times. When she needed to, she retreated from the 40 people gathered and smoked a Newport alone on the deck. When James escorted a group of Alec's friends over to the garden, where they sprinkled some of Alec's ashes, Nicole backed away from the huddle, saying, ""I can't do this."" Some days, she told me later, ""it's all a lot."" Alec would continue to be the face of a growing movement. In a few weeks, a letter from Nicole would be read at a conference in Washington about making prescription medicine affordable. In June, during a hearing on rising drug prices with Azar, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota would invoke Nicole: ""Her son Alec passed away last year because he couldn't afford his insulin,"" she told Azar. Later in the summer, Democratic senators would invite the family to Washington to share their story. There would be plenty of time for more activism, but today was meant for those who knew Alec best.

'Your days are numbered!' House lawmakers get angry over insulin prices,"A House hearing on the affordability of insulin turned tense Wednesday, as visibly frustrated lawmakers repeatedly pressed pharmaceutical executives to explain how a drug patented for $1 ballooned to as much as $280 per vial for Americans.The hearing, by the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, was a rare display of bipartisanship as both Republicans and Democrats chastised the nation's three biggest insulin makers for high list prices.For their part, the company executives returned repeatedly to carefully scripted talking points. List prices can be high, they said, because of a convoluted system of rebates negotiated with prescription benefits plans. The officials also said that their companies were using much of their profits to develop other innovative products that would benefit diabetic patients. And they noted that their companies offered special pricing programs for people who qualify.But lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were having none of it. At one point, Schakowsky suggested illegal price collusion might even be in play, calling insulin costs ""curiously close"" and declaring ""you're in trouble.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" said Schakowsky, D-Illinois.""If you think you can out-talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" she said.Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, said the company will start as of June offering uninsured patients the ability to access insulin for $99 a month. But Rep. Joe Kennedy said the companies only seemed to be moving toward lowering costs when facing pressure from the public and potential regulation from Congress.""No one should be rationing insulin,"" Tregoning said at one point.""And they do every day!"" Kennedy, D-Mass., interrupted.Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which can be controlled by a person's diet, people with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections to regulate their blood sugar.John Locher/AP, FILEA woman with Type 2 diabetes prepares to inject herself with insulin at her home in Las Vegas, April 18, 2017.The Senate Finance Committee this year launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices, citing skyrocketing prices. According to that panel, the insulin drug NovoLog cost 87 percent more in 2019 compared to 2013, while Sanofi's Lantus drug jumped 77 percent. And Eli Lilly's drug Humalog increased 585 percent between 2001 and 2015.Republican Rep. David McKinley said he couldn't understand why a drug that had been around for nearly 100 years would suddenly spike in cost. The inventors of insulin originally sold the patent to the University of Toronto for a single dollar.""I'm a strong, strong supporter of innovation,"" said McKinley of West Virginia. ""But help me out a bit … Innovation is supposed to drive the price down, not up.""Doug Langa, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., which makes NovoLog, said drug companies are researching innovative ways to make life easier for diabetics patients, such as limiting the number of shots they need per day. He also said there were ""perverse"" incentives when it comes to pricing, noting the $18 billion a year his company spends on rebates, discounts and fees.""The higher the rebate, the higher the list price,"" he said.Tregoning of Sanofi said the money negotiated through rebates don't always make it back to the customer.""We don't have visibility on how those rebates are used,"" she told the panel.Rep. Diana DeGette, who chaired the hearing, said: ""it seems to me what is happening is that every component of the drug system is contributing to an upward pressure on the drug price.""",https://t.co/VTekGlXBfx,news
U.S. insulin costs per patient nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016: study,"(Reuters) - The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States nearly doubled over a five-year period, underscoring a national outcry over rising drug prices, according to a new analysis shared with Reuters. Insulin supplies are pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 18, 2019. REUTERS/Carlo AllegriA person with type 1 diabetes incurred annual insulin costs of $5,705, on average, in 2016. The average cost was roughly half that at $2,864 per patient in 2012, according to a report due to be released on Tuesday by the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI). The figures represent the combined amount paid by a patient and their health plan for the medicine and do not reflect rebates paid at a later date. The increasing cost of insulin has led some patients to put their own health at risk. In recent months, anecdotal stories have cropped up from family members and patients describing the rationing of the life-saving medication because they could not afford out-of-pocket expenses for insulin. That has also led to some protests outside company headquarters of insulin makers. HCCI said the jump in spending was driven primarily by higher insulin prices overall and, to a lesser extent, a shift toward more expensive insulin products. Average daily insulin use rose only 3 percent over the same five-year period, the report found. ""It's not that individuals are using more insulin or that new products are particularly innovative or provide immense benefits,"" Jeannie Fuglesten Biniek, a senior researcher at HCCI and the report's co-author said in a phone interview. ""Use is pretty flat, and the price changes are occurring in both older and newer products. That surprised me. The exact same products are costing double,"" she said. Drugmakers say they periodically need to raise U.S. list prices of their medications to help offset steep rebates they must offer to get them covered by insurance plans. In the last two years, major pharmaceutical makers have limited annual price hikes of prescription medicines under growing pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress. NEW OUTRAGE HCCI, based in Washington, D.C., tracks insurance claims data on about 80 million people, drawing on information from the government's Medicare health plan for Americans aged 65 and older and four of the industry's largest health insurers: UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, now owned by CVS Health Corp, Humana Inc and Kaiser Permanente. The insulin report analyzed commercial claims data for about 15,000 patients with type 1 diabetes annually who had at least one prescription for an insulin product during the year. From 2012 to 2016, the average price of insulin increased from 13 cents per unit to 25 cents per unit, according to the report. For the average patient using 60 units per day, the daily cost went from $7.80 in 2012 to $15 in 2016. The findings come amid new outrage over the cost of prescription drugs in the United States, the highest in the world. This month, Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation aimed at lowering prescription medicine costs for consumers and sent letters to 12 drugmakers seeking information on price hikes. They included the top three insulin manufacturers - Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly and Co, Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S and France's Sanofi SA. In October, the Minnesota attorney general sued the three main insulin makers and accused them of deceptively raising prices. A similar proposed class action lawsuit on behalf of patients is pending in New Jersey federal court. ""Different actors want to make an example of insulin now and how its cost is a huge barrier for millions of patients,"" said Rachel Sachs, an associate law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. So far in 2019, Sanofi raised prices on some insulin products between 4.4 percent and 5.2 percent, while Novo Nordisk raised prices on some of its insulins by 4.9 percent. As of Jan. 17, Lilly had not raised prices on its insulins. Sanofi told Reuters that about 85 percent of people who manage their diabetes with its insulin products pay less than $50 a month. Novo Nordisk said a majority of people who manage their diabetes with its insulin products also pay less than $50 a month. Lilly did not respond to a request for comment. About 1.2 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, a chronic condition in which the pancreas stops producing insulin. Type 2 diabetes, a growing problem linked to the obesity epidemic, is far more common, affecting nearly 30 million people in the United States, according to the American Diabetes Association. While type 2 diabetes is treated with a variety of other medicines, those patients may also eventually become dependent on insulin as the disease progresses.

The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/TRmoSFO4xK,news
Non-nutritive sweetener effects may contribute to insulin resistance in consumers with obesity,"NEW ORLEANS — Sucralose, a no-calorie sweetener widely used in beverages, may adversely affect glucose metabolism in consumers with obesity, according to a presenter here. ""There seem to be differential effects of sucralose on glucose metabolism in normal-weight people and in people with obesity, so previous findings in lean subjects cannot be extrapolated to what will be the effects of sucralose in subjects with obesity (and vice versa),"" Marta Yanina Pepino De Gruev, PhD, assistant professor in food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois in Urbana, told Endocrine Today. ""Clinicians may find surprising that sucralose is not metabolically inert, as generally thought, at least for people with obesity."" In a randomized crossover study, Pepino and colleagues conducted 5-hour modified oral glucose tolerance tests on two separate occasions in eight normal-weight adults (mean BMI, 22.9 kg/m2) and seven with obesity (mean BMI 37.9 kg/m2) to determine metabolic effects of sucralose ingestion. All participants had normal insulin response based on Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR score, &lt; 2.6) and were not regular users of non-nutritive sweeteners. Ten minutes before each OGTT, participants consumed either water or the amount of sucralose typically found in a single serving of a diet soda, Pepino said during the presentation. Area under the curve for glucose response was similar in all tests. However, following the sucralose test, area under the curve was increased in the group with obesity by 18% for insulin response and by 12% for C-peptide (P &lt; .02); no differences were seen between the water and sucralose tests in the group with normal weight. Pepino reported that this finding replicated results from a previous trial conducted by her group ""that acute sucralose consumption increases insulin responses to a glucose load in people with obesity, which in the long term may have adverse effects on glucose metabolism."" ""Perhaps we should revise the recommendation of replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with non-caloric sweetened beverages for subjects with obesity who are trying to control their weight,"" Pepino told Endocrine Today. ""We may benefit from considering sweet-tasting beverages, regardless if sweetened with sugars or non-caloric sweeteners, really as a treat, and move toward the recommendation of replacing such beverages with water.""

Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip.

Americans are dying because they can't afford their insulin. That's now a 2020 campaign issue.,"Once a month, Sarah Stark makes the trip to her local pharmacy to pick up the insulin she needs to keep her diabetes in check. She has health insurance through her job and uses a $100 manufacturer's coupon to help defray the cost. Even so, she ends up paying a whopping $728.40.Stark, 28, is not the only one to experience sticker shock when making the purchase. Invariably, the pharmacist who rings her up is taken aback by the price of the medication, and asks if she's certain she wants to complete the purchase. Not that Stark really has a choice. She's a a type 1 diabetic who has had the ailment since childhood. She's willing to pay the price for her daily dose of insulin, even though it poses financial hardship.""Those out of pocket costs add up,"" Stark said during a recent interview with ThinkProgress. ""Not a lot of people could afford that co-pay… and I've seen them have to walk away.""The issue is a matter of life and death — and it's one Stark says deeply informs the choices she makes at the ballot box. ""I one hundred percent vote with my pancreas,"" she said. ""One of my values is that health is a human right. I'm not interested in a candidate who doesn't feel that way.""Insulin pricing may seem like a niche issue, but it's one that affects millions of people across the country. As the 2020 Democratic primary field grows, a few candidates have latched onto the rapidly spiraling price of the medication as a campaign issue, revealing the range of ideas in the party for addressing monopolies and reforming the health care system.More than 30 million people in the United States have diabetes and as of last year, an estimated 7.4 million people like Stark used insulin daily, according to the American Diabetes Association. Without her insurance and the manufacturer's coupon, Stark's insulin would cost about $1,005, so Stark has it easier than some diabetics, 3 percent of whom, according to the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, have no health coverage at all.In recent years, insulin prices have skyrocketed, according to figures compiled by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating possible price gouging in the industry.Between 2001 and 2005, Eli Lilly's Humalog increased from $35 to $234, a 585 percent increase, the Senate panel found.Novo Nordisk's Novolog rose from $289 in 2013 to to $540 in 2019, an 87 percent increase. Sanofi's Lantus, meanwhile, increased in price from $244 to $431 between 2013 and 2019, an approximately 77 percent increase.""Drug companies in general have figured out how to price better from a profit-making perspective,"" Columbia University economist Bhaven Sampat explained. ""They've gotten more sophisticated about finding the maximum price the market can bear and gotten less bashful about it.""That, coupled with the fact that generic versions of a drug cannot be made until the original patent expires — which hasn't happened for insulin yet — has helped create conditions for a system that requires people like Stark to fork over hundreds of dollars each month just to remain healthy.Apparently sensing rising fury from consumers, Eli Lilly recently announced it would offer a half-price version of Humalog. The new drug however would cost $137 a vial, a price that is still unconscionably high, said Christel Aprigliano, CEO of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition (DPAC).""It's not sustainable,"" Aprigliano told ThinkProgress. ""It truly has become a perverted system in which the list price of a drug that is life essential for 8 million Americans just has become unaffordable… [and] the people who are paying the list price are the people who can afford it the least.""Aprigliano said she's heard time and again of diabetics being forced to choose between a life-saving drug and paying other bills, like rent or buying food. Additionally, she said, one in four people on insulin has rationed their medication — purposely taking less than they need — in order to stretch the expensive drug over a longer period of time.""We shouldn't have to spend our days wondering whether we pay rent or pay for food or for my child's health,"" Aprigliano said.As the Democratic primary race begins to take shape, that message seems to have reached the ears of some 2020 contenders.Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) talked about the issue in her announcement speech last month, sharing the story of a 26-year-old man who, three days short of payday, was forced to ration his insulin and ultimately died due to lack of access to the medication.""This disgrace should never have happened in the United States of America. Not with a simple drug that's been around for nearly a century,"" Klobuchar said in Minneapolis. ""The obstacle to change? The big pharma companies think they own Washington. Well they don't own me.""Klobuchar said the Senate needs to pass legislation that would allow health care providers to import drugs from other countries. Additionally, she would stop Big Pharma's practice of ""paying off generic companies to keep their products off the market,"" and ""harness the negotiating power of 43 million seniors"" to lift the ban on negotiating cheaper drug prices under Medicare.The issue of rising insulin has caught the attention of two other 2020 contenders, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ), in the early days of their campaigns. Just days before announcing his presidential bid, Sanders was tweeting about insulin pricing.""Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all,"" he wrote. ""97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can't afford their medication. Outrageous.""Conservative estimates have found that, under Sanders' Medicare for All plan — a central plank of his White House bid — the government would save $61 billion on pharmaceuticals. The single payer advocacy group Physicians for a National Program has estimated that, given the government's strengthened negotiating power under a single-payer system, drug savings — especially for high cost pharmaceuticals like insulin — would be three times that. Another 2020 contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who co-sponsored Sanders' Medicare for All bill, has proposed yet another idea: Let the federal government begin to produce its own pharmaceuticals, including insulin, in order to counter the exorbitant costs of some drugs.Sampat, the Columbia University economist, thinks Warren's idea could work. He believes that the federal government would be immune from patent infringement. The argument some of his colleagues have made against government involvement in production, Sampat said, is that such a program would be inefficient. But, he said, ""We're dealing with an extremely inefficient system already. We could tolerate someone doing that with 80 percent of the acumen.""Both Stark and Aprigliano said they are excited that a health issue as specific as the rising cost of insulin has become a campaign issue. But Stark said that she's glad candidates are considering proposals to lower the cost of insulin and other drugs, talk isn't enough. She the presidential contenders to walk the talk, and swear off donations from pharmaceutical companies.Booker — who during his Senate campaign took more money from Big Pharma in 2014 than any other Democrat — did exactly that last year.""It arouses so much criticism and [we] just stopped taking it,"" Booker told NPR in June. In a statement following the interview, Booker's spokesman Jeff Giertz said the donations from Big Pharma ""became a distraction from his efforts to bring down prescription drug costs"" and that they would not resume.In the last election cycle, 2020 contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), joined Booker, Sanders, and Warren in taking $0 from pharmaceutical companies, according to Kaiser Health News. Those who did take pharmaceutical dollars last cycle ultimately took relatively modest donations: Klobuchar took $8,500, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who is also a presidential contender, took $9,500. (Like Booker, however, Gillibrand has a long history of accepting drug company donations, having accepted more than $200,000 since 2007.)Aprigliano said the next item on her wish list in the fight against ever-inflating drug prices is a candidate willing to take up rebate reform. Right now, pharmacy benefit managers and health plans don't have to disclose how many rebates they pass along or the total value of such price breaks. One way to bring down insulin prices, advocates say, would be to make sure that patients pay the price negotiated between manufacturer and middle man, rather than a mysteriously negotiated list price.Aprigliano said the challenges faced by people who rely on insulin and other medications illustrate the ways in which our broader health care system is broken, and she wants to hear the more candidates address these concerns on the campaign trail.""There's so many things that are complex,"" she said. ""This shouldn't be one of them.""",https://t.co/JXiTzkOein,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients.

Diabetics struggle as drug prices soar,"Struggling to stay alive: Rising insulin prices cause diabetics to go to extremes The escalating cost of insulin has desperate diabetics rationing medication, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from Canada or Mexico. Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY Corrections &amp; Clarifications: This story has been updated to reflect royalty payments for a 1923 patent.Meaghan Carter died alone on the sofa of her suburban Dayton, Ohio, apartment last Christmas.Like most people with Type 1 diabetes, the 47-year-old nurse had a kit of essential supplies within reach. It contained two empty vials of her preferred insulin, a partial vial of inexpensive Walmart insulin and a half-filled container of testing strips to measure blood glucose levels.Uninsured, between jobs and with $50 in a bank account, Carter probably had attempted to stretch a limited supply of insulin until she got a final paycheck from her last job, family members say. She was scheduled to begin a new nursing job the following week that offered health insurance.""There was no insulin at all in the refrigerator,"" says Mindi Patterson, Carter's sister-in-law. ""She had gauze, bandages and all her nursing supplies. She had plenty to take care of others but not enough to take care of herself."" She buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive in the US Deidre Waxman buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive for her on MedicareErin Clark and Jasper Colt, USA TODAYThe cost of insulin for diabetics such as Carter has drawn national scrutiny as Congress examines factors contributing to the nation's escalating prescription drug prices. All people with Type 1 and some with Type 2 diabetes need the drug, but regular price hikes make insulin difficult to afford for the uninsured and those whose coverage requires significant cost sharing.Patient advocates are becoming increasingly vocal about the affordability of a drug invented nearly a century ago by scientists who took steps to make the medicine inexpensive. One group staged protests outside the offices of the nation's three dominant insulin makers.Canadian scientists discovered insulin in 1921, treated the first diabetic patient in 1922 and sold the patent to the University of Toronto for 3 Canadian dollars. The university administered the patent and received royalty payments from drug companies that sold human insulin.The price of modern versions of a drug that more than 7 million Americans need to live nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013, according to one study. Type 1 diabetics paid an average of $5,705 for insulin in 2016 – nearly double what they paid in 2012, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.Diedre Waxman lives in Newton, Mass., and has Type 1 diabetes. Diagnosed six years ago, Waxman has adopted a strict diet, so she doesn't need as much insulin, which she purchases from Canada.Erin Clark for USA TODAYPatient advocates say people have resorted to extreme measures such as taking less than the doctor prescribed to make it last longer, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from less expensive pharmacies in Canada or Mexico.More: Lack of insulin could affect 40 million people with diabetes by 2030, study findsLast month, the powerful Senate Finance Committee asked the three dominant insulin makers detailed questions about the drugs' price increases. The price for one vial of Eli Lilly's Humalog surged from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015. From 2013 to this year, Novo Nordisk's Novolog jumped from $289 to $540 and Sanofi's Lantus from $244 to $431, according to a committee letter.A vial of insulin loses potency after being opened for 28 days. The amount of insulin a patient needs varies depending on such factors as age, weight, diet and overall health.Among things senators want to know: How do drugmakers set insulin prices, and what's the role of rebates and discounts to middlemen pharmacy benefit managers?Senators are not limiting questions to Big Pharma. The nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, who drew scrutiny for their increasingly powerful role as middlemen in the drug supply chain, will appear before the committee April 3.Drugmakers say they've taken steps to address prices, offered co-pay cards to limit out-of-pocket expenses and funded patient-assistance programs that provide free medication to thousands of vulnerable Americans.Sanofi pledged to limit annual price increases to less than the average health spending rate.This month, Eli Lilly unveiled a half-price version of Humalog called insulin lispro for $137.50 for a single vial. It's the same drug as Humalog, only with a different label.In a statement, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the lower-cost insulin is a ""bridge that addresses gaps in the system until a more sustainable model is achieved.""Simeon Taylor, a University of Maryland School of Medicine diabetes researcher, says Type 1 diabetics without adequate insurance coverage are vulnerable to price increases because they can't live without the drug.""Insulin is not an optional medication,"" says Taylor, who formerly worked for Eli Lilly and the National Institutes of Health. ""People have to buy insulin no matter what the cost is. That gives a lot of strength to the people selling insulin.""'Whole system needs to be evaluated'Some suggest that a simple across-the-board price cut might not work for all patients under the system.The American Diabetes Association convened an Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group to study rising insulin prices and affordability of the life-sustaining medicine. The group's study concluded that a complex supply chain from the drug factory to the pharmacy might promote higher prices.Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers, demand rebates from drug manufacturers. Their leverage: placing the drug on an insurer's formulary – the list of drugs that the insurance company will cover for insured consumers.A drugmaker that offers a lower rebate might be excluded from a prescription drug plan or be placed on a less favorable tier that requires consumers to pay a larger portion on the tab.More: Insulin costs nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, report saysThe ADA's working group's report found that even though drugmakers' ""list prices"" for insulin have surged, their ""net prices"" have grown at a more modest rate. The list price is how much the drugmaker charges. The net price is money the drugmaker gets after fees, discounts and rebates to wholesalers or pharmacy benefit managers.Consumers are not privy to these behind-the-scenes negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers and drug manufacturers. All of this is done outside the public's view.""A lot of attention has focused on the manufacturers and less on the other players in the supply chain,"" says Karen Van Nuys, a research professor at USC's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and member of the ADA's working group. ""We think those players also share responsibility for what happens to prices and access.""Van Nuys says that if one drugmaker lowers insulin prices, that could put it at a competitive disadvantage compared with peers. That is because pharmacy benefit managers might still require a significant rebate.Novo Nordisk says its insulin net prices declined at double-digit rates in 2017 and 2018 because of rebate demands.""The whole system needs to be evaluated,"" Van Nuys says.Study: Cost affects insulin useNewton, Massachusetts, resident Deidre Waxman has good prescription-drug coverage through Medicare.But she worries that the $1,300 to $1,500 monthly retail cost of her insulin will be unaffordable if she reaches the doughnut hole, Medicare's deductible that kicks in once drug spending exceeds $3,820.She does not fill insulin prescriptions at her neighborhood pharmacy; she gets her medicine from Canada. Her husband buys insulin during his frequent work trips there, and she will take a six-hour car trip to Canada once a year to get insulin. A third source is Mark's Marine, a Vancouver, British Columbia, pharmacy that ships to U.S. patients.Waxman does not need much insulin because she is on a low-carbohydrate diet. If she has excess insulin, she packs it in styrofoam containers cooled with ice packs and sends it to fellow diabetes patients who can't afford the drug.""I send it to friends who are in dire need,"" Waxman says. ""These are people who would die without insulin.""Diedre Waxman's diabetes bag includes the pen she loads with cartridges to administer her insulin.Erin Clark for USA TODAYFor those without robust insurance coverage, there are signs they are having difficulty affording insulin.Kasia Lipska is an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. Lipska noticed that more Yale Diabetes Center patients seemed to struggle to pay for insulin, so doctors surveyed patients about whether cost influenced their insulin use.One in four patients responded that cost prompted them to use less insulin than prescribed, take smaller doses, stretch out supplies, not fill a prescription or not start the drug. It was a small study at one center in Connecticut, and researchers can't be certain whether insulin affordability is better or worse in other states.People who struggle to pay are ""more in the middle,"" Lipska says.

'Your days are numbered!' House lawmakers get angry over insulin prices,"A House hearing on the affordability of insulin turned tense Wednesday, as visibly frustrated lawmakers repeatedly pressed pharmaceutical executives to explain how a drug patented for $1 ballooned to as much as $280 per vial for Americans.The hearing, by the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, was a rare display of bipartisanship as both Republicans and Democrats chastised the nation's three biggest insulin makers for high list prices.For their part, the company executives returned repeatedly to carefully scripted talking points. List prices can be high, they said, because of a convoluted system of rebates negotiated with prescription benefits plans. The officials also said that their companies were using much of their profits to develop other innovative products that would benefit diabetic patients. And they noted that their companies offered special pricing programs for people who qualify.But lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were having none of it. At one point, Schakowsky suggested illegal price collusion might even be in play, calling insulin costs ""curiously close"" and declaring ""you're in trouble.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" said Schakowsky, D-Illinois.""If you think you can out-talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" she said.Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, said the company will start as of June offering uninsured patients the ability to access insulin for $99 a month.

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/hgDsHmiHRU,news
8 Reasons Why Insulin is so Outrageously Expensive,"Why does insulin cost so much to patients in the USA and around the world? Why is insulin, a widely sold drug of which most forms are now off-patent, so incredibly expensive? These are simple questions, but ones with a number of complicated answers. This post will break some of those answers down and point you in the direction further reading if you want to dive deeper.1. Only 3 Companies Control 90% of the Global Insulin Market The 'big three' insulin producers – Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi – dominate more than 90% of the world insulin market by value. Often only one of these companies supplies insulin in a country, which means they more or less hold a monopoly there and can set prices as they wish. In some countries, notably China and India, there are domestic insulin companies that can help drive down the price. This means we need more companies in markets like the USA to help bring prices down. We'll touch on that a bit further down the list. 2. No Generic InsulinWhen it comes to the question of generic insulin, we are faced with another complicated issue. Insulin is a therapeutic biological product (or 'biologic'), rather than a chemically synthesized molecule. This means it cannot be made as generic in the same way as other drugs. Creating what is called a biosimilar is a lot more complicated and expensive than just duplicating a chemical molecule. There is little market incentive to produce biosimiliars because it costs nearly as much as making new drug, and companies must go through all the approval stages and trials that a new drug is required to go through. Not to mention, current biosimilar insulins on the market – primarily produced by the 'big three' – have only reduced the price by about 10-15%. For more on biosimilars and the 2018 FDA announcement read this and this.3. Pay-for-Delay Schemes &amp; LawsuitsA 'Pay for delay' agreement is a patent dispute settlement in which a generic (in the case of insulin, a biosimilar) manufacturer acknowledges the original patent of a pharmaceutical company and agrees to refrain from marketing its product for a specific period of time. In return, the company receives a payment from the patent-holder. This means it is actually legal for one insulin producer to pay another one not to enter the market. A few years ago the company Merck announced plans to sell a biosimilar version of Sanofi's Lantus. Sanofi sued, and eventually Merck announced that it was no longer pursuing it's biosimilar, presumably due to payments from Sanofi to stay away. If Pay for delay schemes don't work, the 'big three' can still sue other players, prolonging processes and pushing players out of the market because of legal fees and time-wasting. All of these are win-wins for companies, and lose-lose for patients.4. Patents Why aren't we seeing more companies making insulin? There are many reasons for this, but patent evergreening is a big one. Patents give a person or organization a monopoly on a particular invention for a specific period of time. In the USA, it is generally 20 years. Humalog, Lantus and other previous generation insulins are now off patent, as are even older animal based insulins. So what's going on? Pharmaceutical companies take advantage of loopholes in the U.S. patent system to build thickets of patents around their drugs which will make them last much longer (evergreening). This prevents competition and can keep prices high for decades. Our friends at I-MAK recently showed that Sanofi, the maker of Lantus, is no exception. Sanofi has filed 74 patent applications on Lantus alone, that means Sanofi has created the potential for a competition-free monopoly for 37 years. 5. PoliticsCompanies are not in the habit of throwing money away, and they are not in the habit of staying out of politics. Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi collectively rake in several billions of dollars in profits. That's not millions, but billions – with a B. We know they spend millions on marketing, but they also spend millions on lobbying politicians and donating to our decision-makers so that they keep quiet about price gouging. Check if your representatives receive contributions from one of the 'big three' insulin manufacturers or any pharmaceutical company. Chances are, they do. Not to mention, the revolving door between pharma companies and US Government positions. Our current secretary of Health and Human Services was previously an Eli Lilly executive. Obviously, his interests are not with people, but with power. This is why independent patient voices are so important.6. Price FixingThese Business Insider graphs pretty much say it all. Several lawsuits alleging some form price-fixing are currently in the works. You can read more here and here.7. Pharma Marketing SchemesPhysicians in the United States and some other countries are allowed to collect fees from pharmaceutical companies for talks, advice, and more. Supposedly, these are to compensate physicians for their expertise and time. However, they can create loyalty to a company and may influence prescribing habits – a belief shared by some pharmaceutical salespeople. In some countries like India, physicians are allowed to sell and profit off insulin directly through patients, or through pharmacies they themselves own, cutting out middlemen and the retail pharmacies. Thus, they lose the incentive to find the lowest price insulin for their patients. Insulin companies also focus on 'insulin-starts', or the insulin the physician diagnosing patients begins with. As patients are reluctant to change, a number of marketing and financial incentives are employed to influence this decision.8. Payment for Influence (or Silence)Many major key opinion leaders, influencers, and patient advocacy organizations take pharma cash. For example, the two biggest diabetes organizations – The American Diabetes Association and The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation – have accepted huge sums from insulin manufacturers. Other groups were actually created by money from the 'big three', like the World Diabetes Foundation which is funded by Novo Nordisk, and other supposed advocacy groups that are actually doing pharma's bidding, or at least are highly influenced by them. If this issue is important to you, check the funders of an organization you want to support, and if it's not transparent, you can ask if they take industry money.What Can be Done?Patients are speaking out about these issues all around the world. In the USA where prices have skyrocketed especially, T1International Chapters are being formed where patient advocates are educating and pushing for policy change. You can learn more about Chapter here and find more information and action related to the insulin price crisis here.

Want to Reduce Opioid Deaths? Get People the Medications They Need,"A federally funded report released last week came to a striking conclusion: More than 80 percent of the roughly two million people struggling with opioid addiction in the United States are not being treated with the medications most likely to nudge them into remission or prevent them from overdosing. This denial of care is so pervasive and egregious, the report's authors found, that it amounts to a serious ethical breach on the part of both health care providers and the criminal justice system.The Food and Drug Administration has approved three medications to treat opioid use disorder — methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. All of them work by binding to the brain's opiate receptors in a way that reduces the cravings that people addicted to drugs like OxyContin and heroin experience, but without causing the same euphoric high as those drugs. Methadone and buprenorphine have proved especially effective. Patients who take one of those medications are half as likely to die from their addiction; they are also more likely to stay in treatment, and they tend to have better long-term health outcomes.Neither drug is new or experimental — methadone was approved to treat opioid addiction in 1972 and buprenorphine in 2002. Some countries have shown that increasing access to them can significantly drive down the rate of overdose deaths. In France, for example, policies that enabled more doctors to prescribe buprenorphine helped lead to a tenfold increase in the number of people whose opioid use disorder was being treated and to a nearly 80 percent decline in overdose deaths in just four years.Yet, many drug courts and most residential treatment programs in the United States prevent participants from using these medications; and the rehabilitation programs that do offer them rarely offer all three options. The treatments are not available in most emergency rooms, as The Times has reported, even though studies show that patients given buprenorphine in an E.R. are twice as likely to be in treatment a month later than those who are given an information pamphlet. They are also not available in most prisons, even though a significant portion of the federal inmate population suffers from opioid use disorder. Opioid overdose is a leading cause of death among those who've been recently released.Part of the problem is stigma and a profound lack of awareness. Methadone and buprenorphine are opioids. They are weaker than drugs like OxyContin, fentanyl and heroin that have fueled the current crisis, but many law enforcement and medical professionals still see them as trading one addiction for another. Or they mistakenly believe that the medications should be used only temporarily, to help wean patients off stronger opioids. Or they see them as an optional complement to behavioral interventions instead of an essential component of opioid addiction management.None of these perceptions is supported by the balance of scientific evidence. There's also a logistical barrier to getting these drugs into the hands of people who need them. Doctors are allowed to give methadone only at specialized clinics where patients must report every day for their dose. Lines at such clinics are often long, and according to the report, which came from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, Medicaid does not cover the treatment in at least 14 states.Buprenorphine is available by prescription, but health care professionals must obtain a special license to write those prescriptions, a process that requires them to complete hours of additional training, grant the Drug Enforcement Administration access to all of their patient records and agree to strict limits on the number of patients they can treat with the medication. In many states, would-be buprenorphine prescribers also must submit to stringent criteria for insurance reimbursement. These restrictions also are not justified by scientific evidence. They are not employed by other countries, and they are not used to manage the treatment of other chronic medical conditions in the United States.Fewer than seven percent of the nation's doctors have gone through the trouble of clearing these hurdles. As a result, more than half of all counties have no licensed buprenorphine prescriber at all. That's too bad. According to the national academies report, just about anyone with opioid use disorder — teenagers, pregnant women, people with other serious medical conditions — can be treated safely and effectively with the medication.President Trump declared a public health emergency to respond to the opioid crisis in 2017, but so far that declaration has led to very little meaningful action. Congress passed a suite of opioid bills in the fall, but that legislation contained almost no funding. And in most states, strategies that might truly mitigate the disaster — from evidence-based addiction treatments like methadone and buprenorphine to proven harm-reduction approaches like needle exchanges and safe injection sites — remain vastly underutilized or outright illegal.Public health forecasts indicate that the opioid overdose epidemic might claim another 500,000 lives in the next decade. Many of those deaths could be avoided — if existing technologies would just be put to use.",https://t.co/J00UJTlwwz,news

To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/E2SGzZVCNt,news
"On rising insulin prices, lawmaker tells pharma execs: 'Your days are numbered'","The hearing, held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on Capitol Hill, was the second this month to examine how fast-rising insulin costs affect diabetes patients across the United States. The average price of insulin tripled over the course of a decade, from $4.34 per milliliter in 2002 to $12.92 per milliliter in 2013, according to a study published in the medical journal JAMA in 2016.Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky vehemently said during the hearing that prices of insulin are ""curiously close"" between manufacturers and ""way too high.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" she told the panel of executives.""We have the names of people who have died because they couldn't get their insulin,"" she said. ""This is a commitment on the part of the Congress to get drug prices -- particularly life-saving life necessities -- to get those prices under control. ... Your days are numbered.""In response, several executives -- including Doug Langa of Novo Nordisk and Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi -- pointed to how the health care system is ""broken,"" and they all agreed it was unacceptable that some patients are struggling to afford medications.As the hearing adjourned, lawmakers made clear that an investigation into the rising cost of insulin and what can be done about the issue will continue.Companies aim to lower costs; lawmakers argue it's not enoughPeople with diabetes are prescribed insulin because their bodies either do not produce it (as with Type 1 diabetes) or do not use it properly (as with Type 2 diabetes). There are more than 20 types of insulin sold in the United States, according to the American Diabetes Association.Ahead of Wednesday's hearing, pharmaceutical company Sanofi announced plans to reduce the price of insulin for qualifying patients to $99 a month for up to 10 boxes of pens or 10-milliliter vials. The new monthly price for qualifying patients will start in June, according to the company.""It is unacceptable to Sanofi that some people living with diabetes are struggling to pay for their insulin, so we have moved to act creatively and aggressively to help address affordability and access needs,"" Michelle Carnahan, head of North America Primary Care at Sanofi, said in the announcement. ""By giving those who require both long-acting and/or mealtime insulins or use more than one box of pens or one vial per month access to their insulins for one flat price, we aim to help limit the burden on the individuals who have high out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter,"" she said.US Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who helped launch a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices in February, called the move ""a step in the right direction"" in a written statement Wednesday.""But like Cigna's announcement on insulin prices last week, this raises a lot of questions. Why was Sanofi charging so much more before this announcement? What took them so long to offer the price reduction?"" he added. ""It shouldn't take months of bad press, persistent public outcry and increasing congressional scrutiny to get a company to charge a fair price. That's not how a functioning marketplace works.""Health insurer Cigna said last week that it's launching a program that will cap out-of-pocket expenses at $25 for a 30-day supply of insulin. Last year, patients paid an average of $41.50 a month out of pocket, including deductibles, copays or coinsurance, for the lifesaving diabetes drug, according to the company.Its Patient Assurance Program will be available to members of participating nongovernment-funded pharmacy plans managed by Express Scripts, including Cigna and other plans. Cigna acquired Express Scripts, the largest US pharmacy benefit management company, in December.""In most cases, people who use insulin will see lower out-of-pocket costs without any increased cost to the plan,"" the company said.'A matter of life and death'Also last week, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that it intends to bring competition to the insulin market as a way to lower prices. Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the agency would change how insulin is regulated in order to enable products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, insulin to come to market.""Access to affordable insulin can be a matter of life and death for Americans with diabetes. Insulin is a critical hormone that regulates sugar metabolism,"" Gottlieb said in the announcement.""But access to this critical drug can be increasingly difficult for these Americans. Insulin list prices regularly increase by double digits annually,"" he said. ""Driving down drug prices requires a comprehensive approach. But one impactful route is through competition. This is particularly true following the introductions of generics, especially when there are three or more generic competitors -- which has been shown to bring down prices more sharply than with only one or two generic competitors.""In March, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a cheaper generic version of its rapid-acting insulin Humalog. At half the price of Humalog, the generic insulin lispro will carry a list price of $137.35 per vial, the company said, or $265.20 for a pack of five pens. Brand-name Humalog will remain on the market.Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette, chairwoman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, said at Wednesday's hearing that Humalog cost only $35 a vial in 2001 and that the price increased even though the drug formulary remained the same.""Let's not kid ourselves that the generic equivalent of this is really any cheaper,"" she said shortly before the hearing adjourned.",https://t.co/MCKZA0pvBQ,news
"Why is insulin so expensive? The absurd cost of a diabetes drug, explained.","When inventor Frederick Banting discovered insulin in 1923, he refused to put his name on the patent. He felt it was unethical for a doctor to profit from a discovery that would save lives. Banting's co-inventors, James Collip and Charles Best, sold the insulin patent to the University of Toronto for a mere $1. They wanted everyone who needed their medication to be able to afford it. Today, Banting and colleagues would be spinning in their graves: Their drug, which many of the 30 million Americans with diabetes rely on, has become the poster child for pharmaceutical price gouging. The cost of the four most popular types of insulin has tripled over the past decade, and the out-of-pocket prescription costs patients now face have doubled. By 2016, the average price of insulin rose to $450 per month — and costs continue to rise, so much so that as many as one in four people with diabetes are now skimping on or skipping lifesaving doses.Members of Congress have been pressuring drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers to bring insulin costs under control. Last Wednesday, one health care company showed that it's attempting to respond to the problem.The insurance behemoth Cigna, and its pharmacy benefit arm Express Scripts, announced a new program that'll cap the 30-day cost of insulin at $25. That's a 40 percent reduction from the $41.50-per-month fee people with Express Scripts benefits were paying in 2018. The program is expected to launch later this year for insurance plans that work with Express Scripts benefits. By next year, all diabetes patients on Cigna plans will be able to join, according to the Washington Post. It could affect as many as 700,000 patients who rely on Cigna or Express Scripts for insulin coverage, and will apply even before they've met their deductible. But there are several catches here. In order for Cigna patients to participate, their employers will have to opt into the change in plan, Stat reported. And Cigna is just one of many insurance companies out there, covering less than 1 percent of the 23 million living with diabetes in America.""Any measure that helps only a portion of the population through opaque deals between the players responsible for this crisis is not a solution,"" Elizabeth Pfiester, the founder and executive director of the patient group T1International, told Vox. ""We need long-term assurance that manufacturers will be held accountable and prices will be affordable — not another Band-Aid.""Most patients with diabetes are still going to be vulnerable to the whims of drug company pricing, since companies can still set whatever prices they wish. And no drug is better for understanding how that happened than insulin. How the companies justify their price increases With Type 1 diabetes, which affects about 5 percent of people with diabetes in the US, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leaving the body with little or none of the hormone. With Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas still makes insulin, but the body has grown resistant to its effects. In both cases, patients rely on insulin medication to keep energy from food flowing into their bodies. But the US is a global outlier on money spent on the drug, representing only 15 percent of the global insulin market and generating almost half of the pharmaceutical industry's insulin revenue. According to a recent study in JAMA Internal Medicine, in the 1990s Medicaid paid between $2.36 and $4.43 per unit of insulin; by 2014, those prices more than tripled, depending on the formulation. Medicaid reimbursement trends for covered insulin products from 1991 to 2014. JAMA Internal Medicine The doctors and researchers who study insulin say it is yet another example — along with EpiPens and decades-old generic drugs — of companies raising the cost of their products because of the lax regulatory environment around drug pricing. ""They are doing it because they can,"" Jing Luo, a researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told Vox in 2017, ""and it's scary because it happens in all kinds of different drugs and drug classes.""In countries with single-payer health systems, governments exert much more influence over the entire health care process.In England, for example, the government has an agency that negotiates directly with pharmaceutical companies. The government sets a maximum price it will pay for a drug, and if companies don't agree, they simply lose out on the entire market. This puts drugmakers at a disadvantage, driving down the price of drugs.The US doesn't do that. Instead, America has long taken a free market approach to pharmaceuticals.Drug companies haggle separately over drug prices with a variety of private insurers across the country. Meanwhile, Medicare, the government health program for those over 65, which is also the nation's largest buyer of drugs, is actually barred from negotiating drug prices.That gives pharma more leverage, and it leads to the kind of price surges we've seen with EpiPens, recent opioid antidotes — and insulin.Insulin manufacturers say the increases are just the price tag that comes with innovation — creating more effective insulin formulations for patients. According to a 2017 Lancet paper on insulin price increases, ""Older insulins have been successively replaced with newer, incrementally improved products covered by numerous additional patents."" The result is that more than 90 percent of privately insured patients with Type 2 diabetes in America are prescribed the latest and costliest versions of insulin. But soaring prices for these newer formulations is out of step with how much they improve treatment for patients, said Yale endocrinologist Kasia Lipska. For Type-1 diabetes, newer formulations appear to be more effective at controlling blood sugar than older formulations. ""For Type-2 diabetes, it's less clear — the benefits are not as strong."" So, Lipska asked, ""Are [the new insulins] 20 times better? I'm not sure."" Luo, the Lancet paper's lead author, doesn't find the ""cost of innovation"" argument very convincing. In his research, he's come across many examples of the same insulin products that have been continuously available for years without improvements, yet their price tags have gone up at a much higher rate than inflation.""The list price of these products are already out of reach for most Americans living with diabetes — in some cases, over $300 a vial,"" he said. ""It is also strange to see Humulin still priced at over $150 a vial considering this product was first sold in the US in 1982.""Drugmakers do this because they canSo insulin's drug pricing problem is much bigger than anything Cigna alone can fix. But more changes in the market may be on the horizon. The three major insulin makers — Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi — will testify before the House Energy and Commerce's oversight subcommittee this week, focusing more attention on the issue. Lawmakers, including Chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), have also been investigating the problem and sending letters to drug companies asking them to account for their outrageous price hikes. But while the pressure around insulin may be mounting, we're also seeing the terrible impact of rising insulin prices on patients: people being forced to taper off insulin so they can pay their medical bills and winding up with kidney failure, blindness, or even death. One clear solution to the problem would be to bring a generic version of insulin to the market. There are currently no true generic options available. (Though there are several rebranded and biosimilar insulins.) This is in part because companies have made those incremental improvements to insulin products, which has allowed them to keep their formulations under patent, and because older insulin formulations have fallen out of fashion. But not all insulins are patent-protected. (For example, none of Eli Lilly's insulins are, according to the drugmaker.) In those cases, Luo said, potential manufacturers may be deterred by secondary patents on non-active ingredients in insulins or on associated devices (such as insulin delivery pens). There's also ""extreme regulatory complexity"" around bringing follow-on generic insulins to market, Luo added. And that's something regulators, such as the Food and Drug Administration, have been working to streamline. History has shown that their efforts are worthwhile: When cheaper generic options are introduced to the market, overall drug prices come down. A century after insulin was discovered, it's about time we had one.",https://t.co/Orl6AGRqm8,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/YoLZYXMBXf,news

But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/5SSW3hufWA,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"".

'Your days are numbered!' House lawmakers get angry over insulin prices,"(WASHINGTON) — A House hearing on the affordability of insulin turned tense Wednesday, as visibly frustrated lawmakers repeatedly pressed pharmaceutical executives to explain how a drug patented for $1 ballooned to as much as $280 per vial for Americans.The hearing, by the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, was a rare display of bipartisanship as both Republicans and Democrats chastised the nation's three biggest insulin makers for high list prices.For their part, the company executives returned repeatedly to carefully scripted talking points. List prices can be high, they said, because of a convoluted system of rebates negotiated with prescription benefits plans. The officials also said that their companies were using much of their profits to develop other innovative products that would benefit diabetic patients. And they noted that their companies offered special pricing programs for people who qualify.But lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were having none of it. At one point, Schakowsky suggested illegal price collusion might even be in play, calling insulin costs ""curiously close"" and declaring ""you're in trouble.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" said Schakowsky, D-Illinois.""If you think you can out-talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" she said.Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, said the company will start as of June offering uninsured patients the ability to access insulin for $99 a month. But Rep. Joe Kennedy said the companies only seemed to be moving toward lowering costs when facing pressure from the public and potential regulation from Congress.""No one should be rationing insulin,"" Tregoning said at one point.""And they do every day!"" Kennedy, D-Mass., interrupted.Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which can be controlled by a person's diet, people with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections to regulate their blood sugar.The Senate Finance Committee this year launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices, citing skyrocketing prices. According to that panel, the insulin drug NovoLog cost 87 percent more in 2019 compared to 2013, while Sanofi's Lantus drug jumped 77 percent. And Eli Lilly's drug Humalog increased 585 percent between 2001 and 2015.Republican Rep. David McKinley said he couldn't understand why a drug that had been around for nearly 100 years would suddenly spike in cost. The inventors of insulin originally sold the patent to the University of Toronto for a single dollar.""I'm a strong, strong supporter of innovation,"" said McKinley of West Virginia. ""But help me out a bit … Innovation is supposed to drive the price down, not up.""Doug Langa, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., which makes NovoLog, said drug companies are researching innovative ways to make life easier for diabetics patients, such as limiting the number of shots they need per day. He also said there were ""perverse"" incentives when it comes to pricing, noting the $18 billion a year his company spends on rebates, discounts and fees.""The higher the rebate, the higher the list price,"" he said.Tregoning of Sanofi said the money negotiated through rebates don't always make it back to the customer.""We don't have visibility on how those rebates are used,"" she told the panel.Rep. Diana DeGette, who chaired the hearing, said: ""it seems to me what is happening is that every component of the drug system is contributing to an upward pressure on the drug price.""Copyright © 2019, ABC Radio.

Diabetes behind bars results in deadly toll,"After Douglas Brown was booked into the Fulton County Jail for failing to pay child support, he repeatedly complained that he wasn't receiving his twice-daily insulin for his diabetes. Despite his pleas, he missed doses and his health grew progressively worse. Over the next 10 days, the 41-year-old Army veteran struggled with increasing pain, seizures, incontinence, confusion and lethargy until, finally, he was found dead on the floor of his cell with traces of vomit on his face. Brown was among at least a dozen people who have died in Georgia's prisons and jails over the last decade due to diabetic ketoacidosis, a first-of-its-kind investigation by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has found. Like Brown, many died gruesomely. And like Brown, they died because those responsible for their care failed to properly treat a disease managed daily by millions of Americans.Diabetic ketoacidosis, often simply referred to as DKA, is fatal only when diabetes is left untreated. As blood sugar surges, the blood turns acidic. Eventually, organs shut down. » AJC INVESTIGATES | Twelve who died from diabetes in jail or prison » RELATED | Another victim adds to Georgia prison doctor's grim legacyIn some of the cases examined by the AJC, inmates died from diabetic ketoacidosis when their dependence on insulin and other drugs should have been known to doctors and nurses based on intake screening exams. Had the inmates received their regular dosages of insulin and other drugs, DKA could have been prevented. Others apparently weren't known to have diabetes when they were locked up. Yet, according to experts, their symptoms should have been a sign that they needed immediate medical attention, including monitoring of their blood sugar. If they'd been treated, usually with insulin and hydration, they could have recovered. ""This is just a bad situation — really bad — and it shouldn't happen to anyone,"" said Brown's 80-year-old father, Robert Brown, himself an insulin-dependent diabetic.Some states have treated such failures as crimes. In Mississippi and Arkansas, nurses have gone to prison or jail themselves for neglect of diabetic inmates. So, too, has an Oklahoma county jail administrator charged by federal prosecutors with depriving an inmate of insulin. Yet none of the deaths documented by the AJC led to criminal charges.What's more, neither of the two agencies responsible for medical care in the Georgia prison system has a comprehensive policy for treating the thousands of incarcerated diabetics, nor can they say exactly how many diabetics are being treated.Because diabetes is such a pervasive problem in correctional institutions, the American Diabetes Association has written policies to guide inmate care. One of the ADA's key points is that diabetics ""at all levels of custody"" should have access to medication and dosing consistent with their usual treatment plans. The organization also says staff must be trained to recognize and respond to acute health crises.Based on the ADA's recommendations, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has adopted detailed protocols for diabetes management in its facilities.But the AJC's investigation indicates that across Georgia, in correctional facilities of all kinds, those concepts have yet to take hold.""I know it's not easy working in a jail,"" said Dr. Bruce Bode, an Atlanta diabetes specialist and Emory School of Medicine faculty member. ""They (inmates) can tell you anything and everything to get what they want. But if it's a medical issue, you've got to evaluate it, and diabetes is clearly something that has to be evaluated. If you don't give them insulin, they're going to die.""Defining a problemDiabetes has become an increasingly significant issue in prisons and jails across the country as the inmate population has aged. Between 2004 and 2012, the rate of diabetes among state and federal inmates nearly doubled, according to a 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Justice.There is no data, though, that show how many die from diabetic ketoacidosis.Sarah Fech-Baughman, the director of litigation for the American Diabetes Association, said the AJC's investigation is the first she's aware of to document DKA deaths for one state or prison system. The 12 Georgia deaths speak to a nationwide problem, she said.""In a prison, it shouldn't happen. There should be a system of care that's effective enough to prevent DKA deaths most of the time."" —Dr. Michael Puerini, a past president of the American College of Correctional Physicians""Unfortunately, that statistic is not surprising to me, and is in line with what I would expect, based on what we hear from folks,"" she wrote in an email.To identify DKA deaths in Georgia, the AJC analyzed in-custody deaths since 2008 and found the condition reported as the cause for 11 men and one woman.Seven of the deaths were in county and city lockups, including the Fulton County Jail, the Atlanta City Detention Center and the Cobb County Adult Detention Center. Five were in prisons operated by the Georgia Department of Corrections.In half of all cases, evidence developed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and other agencies indicated that doctors, nurses and jailers knew or should have known that those in their care were diabetics, yet failed to make sure they received proper dosages of insulin or other drugs.The National Commission on Correctional Health Care, which sets standards for health services in prisons and jails, says screening exams for inmates must cover current medications and past and present health issues and symptoms of any chronic diseases. Anyone with diabetes should have a blood glucose screening.Many family members contacted for this story expressed outrage as they learned for the first time that their loved ones died from a condition that can be prevented.""We just thought it was probably a freak situation,"" said Sandra Smith, whose brother, 34-year-old Tyrence Mobley, died at Hays State Prison in 2011. ""Then we hear this. Something's definitely wrong.""'It shouldn't happen'The deaths in Georgia's state prison system raise particular questions because those facilities, unlike smaller city and county jails, typically have full-time medical directors and others in place to deal with chronic health issues.In Oregon, Dr. Michael Puerini, a past president of the American College of Correctional Physicians, said he couldn't recall a single death due to diabetic ketoacidosis in the 10 years he worked as medical director in his state's prison system.""In a prison, it shouldn't happen,"" he said. ""There should be a system of care that's effective enough to prevent DKA deaths most of the time.""About 50 physicians work in Georgia prison facilities as employees of Georgia Correctional HealthCare, a branch of Augusta University that contracts with the Department of Corrections to provide medical services. Even some of the prison system's most experienced physicians have failed to diagnose diabetes, as revealed by a federal lawsuit the state settled last year for $215,000. The suit was brought by the family of 63-year-old Esteban Mosqueda-Romero, who died from DKA in January 2014 at Hays State Prison.Mosqueda-Romero never was treated for diabetes even though a blood sugar test indicated that he had the disease when he entered the prison system in April 2013 to begin serving a 25-year sentence for child molestation in Hall County, records show.On the day before he died, his blood sugar was 1,472, nearly 13 times a normal reading and one so high that healthcare workers rarely see it.After reviewing Mosqueda-Romero's medical records, the medical director for the Salt Lake County Jail System, Dr. Todd Wilcox, wrote that the inmate died ""very painfully as his bodily systems gradually deteriorated to the point that he was no longer responsive."" The physician who was then the medical director at Hays State Prison, Dr. Monica Hill, acknowledged in an account for the state's mortality review that Mosqueda-Romero's death would have been prevented had she and other doctors paid closer attention to his medical records.""This resulted from failure by the upper-level providers at three institutions to diagnose Type II diabetes,"" she wrote.Hill and the physician responsible for the inmate's initial evaluation, Dr. Joseph Fowlkes, still work in the prison system. Fowlkes remains at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison, while Hill is the medical director at Lee Arrendale State Prison, the state's largest facility for women.Christen Engel, Augusta University's senior associate vice president of communications, declined to make those physicians or Dr. Billy Nichols, the statewide medical director for Georgia Correctional HealthCare, available to be interviewed.Instead, she issued a written statement saying Georgia Correctional HealthCare would partner with the Department of Corrections to review the deaths documented by the AJC and ""act accordingly.""The state prison system's ability to deal with diabetes has previously drawn scrutiny as a result of lawsuits by two diabetic inmates who each had to have a leg amputated after minor cuts became severely infected. One of those cases was settled with the state paying the inmate, Michael Tarver, $550,000.Grim death in AtlantaGeorgia's city and county correctional facilities also have failed to recognize and adequately treat those with diabetes, with some of the most troubling cases in Atlanta.Wickie Bryant, 55, died in October 2015 after a month in the Atlanta City Detention Center, where she was being held on a disorderly conduct charge. When her body was discovered, she was lying on her bunk in full rigor, an indication that she had been dead for hours. Vomit was on the floor, on her face and on the sheet underneath her. Reporting on the death for the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office, investigator Betty Honey wrote that she couldn't find anyone at the jail who could explain why Bryant was in such a state.""I asked if she was taking medications while in jail and what her history was,"" Honey wrote. ""No one could tell me about her history or if meds were given while she has been there.""Bryant's sister, Mildred Sims, is suing the city in federal court. The lawsuit notes that Bryant, who had a history of mental problems, refused insulin and blood sugar testing while she was in jail, but it contends that those overseeing her care should have referred her to a physician or seen that she was hospitalized.» MORE | Georgia to pay $550,000 to convicted murderer because of amputationBrown's death in the Fulton County Jail in October 2013 was the first of two in the facility as it cycled through two companies to provide medical care, Corizon Health and Correct Care Solutions. The jail has since moved on to a third firm, NaphCare Inc.In a lawsuit alleging medical malpractice on the part of Corizon and others, Brown's father claimed that a nurse took no action when she found Brown on the floor, groaning and incapable of following commands, in the hours before his death.The lawsuit was resolved through a confidential settlement with Corizon, according to Robert Brown's attorney, Mawuli Davis. That's small consolation for the elder Brown, who said he visited the front desk at the jail four times in an effort to convince administrators that his son needed insulin.""My son didn't get (his medication) for his diabetes,"" he said in a recent interview. ""How can that happen in this day and time? More should be done to hold people responsible other than going to court and getting money for losing a loved one."" Four years later, Willie Green III died eight days after he was booked into the Fulton jail. The 41-year-old was arrested at the Greyhound bus station downtown on charges of criminal trespass and obstruction of a law enforcement officer while changing buses on his way home to Simpsonville, S.C.Green was transferred to Grady Memorial Hospital four days after his arrest when his blood sugar spiked to four times the normal range and his body was ""ice cold,"" according to jail records. He died at the hospital.According to Green's friends and family members, he was an insulin-dependent diabetic who stayed on top of the disease, keeping his medications in a case.Fulton County's chief jailer, Mark Adger said Green should have been taken directly to Grady after his arrest because his blood sugar was so high when he entered the jail. If that had occurred, he might have survived, Adger said.""My concern before he passed was when they checked his blood sugar, it was higher than I'd ever seen, and, for some reason, we decided to take him,"" Adger said.A prosecution declinedThe circumstances in several of the Georgia deaths are similar to those in the case of 20-year-old Morgan Angerbauer, who died of DKA in a Texarkana, Arkansas jail in 2016. The case made national headlines because a nurse, Brittany Johnson, pleaded guilty to negligent homicide and was sentenced to three months in jail herself.The prosecutor, Stephanie Barrett, told the AJC she had no hesitation in charging Johnson after jail video showed her refusing to check Angerbauer's blood sugar as the inmate begged for help.""If I saw something like this, someone just refusing when an inmate asked for help, I'd prosecute every time,"" she said. The AJC could find only one case in Georgia in which criminal charges were contemplated. A coroner's inquest in Whitfield County in 2009 ruled that the death of 39-year-old truck driver Barnes Nowlin Jr. was a homicide. Yet even then, the county's district attorney at the time, Kermit McManus, declined to prosecute.Nowlin died three days after being booked into the jail for failing to pay a fine for a traffic accident in which he clipped a mailbox and left the scene. He had driven to Dalton from his home in Rome to pay the fine, but he was taken into custody because he had missed an earlier court date.The GBI concluded that Nowlin died from natural causes. But it also found evidence that the nurse in charge left the jail just hours before Nowlin's death even though the nurse knew the inmate was a diabetic and that his health was failing.In statements to the GBI, two jailers said they told the nurse, Robert Pierce, that Nowlin had been vomiting and repeatedly falling down. In response, they said, Pierce instructed them to have Nowlin fill out a medical request form so he could be seen the next day.Pierce, in his statement to the GBI, confirmed the jailers' accounts but said he didn't believe Nowlin was in serious jeopardy. Pierce also noted that he had previously been admonished by his superiors for being ""too nice"" to inmates. At the inquest, jurors heard from a GBI deputy medical examiner, Dr. Jacqueline Martin, who testified that had Nowlin's blood sugar been tested at the time the officers expressed their concerns, it might have saved his life.""If they would have tested the sugar at an earlier time and it was noted that it was elevated, yes, this condition could have been treated,"" Martin testified.In 2012, Whitfield County, which employed Pierce, paid $850,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by Nowlin's wife.McManus, who retired in 2012, wrote in an email to the AJC that he didn't have an ""independent recollection"" of the case. Interviewed by the Dalton Daily Citizen-News at the time of the inquest, he downplayed the finding, saying it ""does not create a case and has no meaning whatsoever.""﻿Data specialist Jennifer Peebles contributed to this report.--Support real journalism.

The cost to taxpayersSome 80,000 people held in U.S. prisons or jails have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.If diabetics aren't provided with proper care, they can develop other serious health issues that are costlier to treat. Some state and local governments also have had to pay out hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to resolve lawsuits accusing them of deliberate indifference to the medical needs of diabetic inmates.What is Diabetic Ketoacidosis?Diabetic ketoacidosis, commonly known as DKA, is a serious and potentially fatal complication of diabetes that develops when the body can't produce enough insulin.The lack of insulin leads to severely elevated blood glucose levels, causing the body to break down fat as fuel. That turns the blood acidic. And that, if left untreated, causes organs to fail.DKA is more common for people with type 1 diabetes because they are totally insulin dependent, but it also can affect those with type 2.Symptoms include nausea and vomiting, frequent urination, thirst, weakness or fatigue and confusion. Treatment involves administering insulin and fluids.",https://t.co/FRMTmiaTps,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/UTNzHqF8GG,news
Diabetes behind bars results in deadly toll,"After Douglas Brown was booked into the Fulton County Jail for failing to pay child support, he repeatedly complained that he wasn't receiving his twice-daily insulin for his diabetes. Despite his pleas, he missed doses and his health grew progressively worse. Over the next 10 days, the 41-year-old Army veteran struggled with increasing pain, seizures, incontinence, confusion and lethargy until, finally, he was found dead on the floor of his cell with traces of vomit on his face. Brown was among at least a dozen people who have died in Georgia's prisons and jails over the last decade due to diabetic ketoacidosis, a first-of-its-kind investigation by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has found. Like Brown, many died gruesomely. And like Brown, they died because those responsible for their care failed to properly treat a disease managed daily by millions of Americans.Diabetic ketoacidosis, often simply referred to as DKA, is fatal only when diabetes is left untreated. As blood sugar surges, the blood turns acidic. Eventually, organs shut down. » AJC INVESTIGATES | Twelve who died from diabetes in jail or prison » RELATED | Another victim adds to Georgia prison doctor's grim legacyIn some of the cases examined by the AJC, inmates died from diabetic ketoacidosis when their dependence on insulin and other drugs should have been known to doctors and nurses based on intake screening exams. Had the inmates received their regular dosages of insulin and other drugs, DKA could have been prevented. Others apparently weren't known to have diabetes when they were locked up. Yet, according to experts, their symptoms should have been a sign that they needed immediate medical attention, including monitoring of their blood sugar. If they'd been treated, usually with insulin and hydration, they could have recovered. ""This is just a bad situation — really bad — and it shouldn't happen to anyone,"" said Brown's 80-year-old father, Robert Brown, himself an insulin-dependent diabetic.Some states have treated such failures as crimes. In Mississippi and Arkansas, nurses have gone to prison or jail themselves for neglect of diabetic inmates. So, too, has an Oklahoma county jail administrator charged by federal prosecutors with depriving an inmate of insulin. Yet none of the deaths documented by the AJC led to criminal charges.What's more, neither of the two agencies responsible for medical care in the Georgia prison system has a comprehensive policy for treating the thousands of incarcerated diabetics, nor can they say exactly how many diabetics are being treated.Because diabetes is such a pervasive problem in correctional institutions, the American Diabetes Association has written policies to guide inmate care. One of the ADA's key points is that diabetics ""at all levels of custody"" should have access to medication and dosing consistent with their usual treatment plans. The organization also says staff must be trained to recognize and respond to acute health crises.Based on the ADA's recommendations, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has adopted detailed protocols for diabetes management in its facilities.But the AJC's investigation indicates that across Georgia, in correctional facilities of all kinds, those concepts have yet to take hold.""I know it's not easy working in a jail,"" said Dr. Bruce Bode, an Atlanta diabetes specialist and Emory School of Medicine faculty member. ""They (inmates) can tell you anything and everything to get what they want. But if it's a medical issue, you've got to evaluate it, and diabetes is clearly something that has to be evaluated. If you don't give them insulin, they're going to die.""Defining a problemDiabetes has become an increasingly significant issue in prisons and jails across the country as the inmate population has aged. Between 2004 and 2012, the rate of diabetes among state and federal inmates nearly doubled, according to a 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Justice.There is no data, though, that show how many die from diabetic ketoacidosis.Sarah Fech-Baughman, the director of litigation for the American Diabetes Association, said the AJC's investigation is the first she's aware of to document DKA deaths for one state or prison system. The 12 Georgia deaths speak to a nationwide problem, she said.""In a prison, it shouldn't happen. There should be a system of care that's effective enough to prevent DKA deaths most of the time."" —Dr. Michael Puerini, a past president of the American College of Correctional Physicians""Unfortunately, that statistic is not surprising to me, and is in line with what I would expect, based on what we hear from folks,"" she wrote in an email.To identify DKA deaths in Georgia, the AJC analyzed in-custody deaths since 2008 and found the condition reported as the cause for 11 men and one woman.Seven of the deaths were in county and city lockups, including the Fulton County Jail, the Atlanta City Detention Center and the Cobb County Adult Detention Center. Five were in prisons operated by the Georgia Department of Corrections.In half of all cases, evidence developed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and other agencies indicated that doctors, nurses and jailers knew or should have known that those in their care were diabetics, yet failed to make sure they received proper dosages of insulin or other drugs.The National Commission on Correctional Health Care, which sets standards for health services in prisons and jails, says screening exams for inmates must cover current medications and past and present health issues and symptoms of any chronic diseases. Anyone with diabetes should have a blood glucose screening.Many family members contacted for this story expressed outrage as they learned for the first time that their loved ones died from a condition that can be prevented.""We just thought it was probably a freak situation,"" said Sandra Smith, whose brother, 34-year-old Tyrence Mobley, died at Hays State Prison in 2011. ""Then we hear this. Something's definitely wrong.""'It shouldn't happen'The deaths in Georgia's state prison system raise particular questions because those facilities, unlike smaller city and county jails, typically have full-time medical directors and others in place to deal with chronic health issues.In Oregon, Dr. Michael Puerini, a past president of the American College of Correctional Physicians, said he couldn't recall a single death due to diabetic ketoacidosis in the 10 years he worked as medical director in his state's prison system.""In a prison, it shouldn't happen,"" he said. ""There should be a system of care that's effective enough to prevent DKA deaths most of the time.""About 50 physicians work in Georgia prison facilities as employees of Georgia Correctional HealthCare, a branch of Augusta University that contracts with the Department of Corrections to provide medical services. Even some of the prison system's most experienced physicians have failed to diagnose diabetes, as revealed by a federal lawsuit the state settled last year for $215,000. The suit was brought by the family of 63-year-old Esteban Mosqueda-Romero, who died from DKA in January 2014 at Hays State Prison.Mosqueda-Romero never was treated for diabetes even though a blood sugar test indicated that he had the disease when he entered the prison system in April 2013 to begin serving a 25-year sentence for child molestation in Hall County, records show.On the day before he died, his blood sugar was 1,472, nearly 13 times a normal reading and one so high that healthcare workers rarely see it.After reviewing Mosqueda-Romero's medical records, the medical director for the Salt Lake County Jail System, Dr. Todd Wilcox, wrote that the inmate died ""very painfully as his bodily systems gradually deteriorated to the point that he was no longer responsive."" The physician who was then the medical director at Hays State Prison, Dr. Monica Hill, acknowledged in an account for the state's mortality review that Mosqueda-Romero's death would have been prevented had she and other doctors paid closer attention to his medical records.""This resulted from failure by the upper-level providers at three institutions to diagnose Type II diabetes,"" she wrote.Hill and the physician responsible for the inmate's initial evaluation, Dr. Joseph Fowlkes, still work in the prison system. Fowlkes remains at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison, while Hill is the medical director at Lee Arrendale State Prison, the state's largest facility for women.Christen Engel, Augusta University's senior associate vice president of communications, declined to make those physicians or Dr. Billy Nichols, the statewide medical director for Georgia Correctional HealthCare, available to be interviewed.Instead, she issued a written statement saying Georgia Correctional HealthCare would partner with the Department of Corrections to review the deaths documented by the AJC and ""act accordingly.""The state prison system's ability to deal with diabetes has previously drawn scrutiny as a result of lawsuits by two diabetic inmates who each had to have a leg amputated after minor cuts became severely infected. One of those cases was settled with the state paying the inmate, Michael Tarver, $550,000.Grim death in AtlantaGeorgia's city and county correctional facilities also have failed to recognize and adequately treat those with diabetes, with some of the most troubling cases in Atlanta.Wickie Bryant, 55, died in October 2015 after a month in the Atlanta City Detention Center, where she was being held on a disorderly conduct charge. When her body was discovered, she was lying on her bunk in full rigor, an indication that she had been dead for hours. Vomit was on the floor, on her face and on the sheet underneath her. Reporting on the death for the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office, investigator Betty Honey wrote that she couldn't find anyone at the jail who could explain why Bryant was in such a state.""I asked if she was taking medications while in jail and what her history was,"" Honey wrote. ""No one could tell me about her history or if meds were given while she has been there.""Bryant's sister, Mildred Sims, is suing the city in federal court. The lawsuit notes that Bryant, who had a history of mental problems, refused insulin and blood sugar testing while she was in jail, but it contends that those overseeing her care should have referred her to a physician or seen that she was hospitalized.» MORE | Georgia to pay $550,000 to convicted murderer because of amputationBrown's death in the Fulton County Jail in October 2013 was the first of two in the facility as it cycled through two companies to provide medical care, Corizon Health and Correct Care Solutions.

The 41-year-old was arrested at the Greyhound bus station downtown on charges of criminal trespass and obstruction of a law enforcement officer while changing buses on his way home to Simpsonville, S.C.Green was transferred to Grady Memorial Hospital four days after his arrest when his blood sugar spiked to four times the normal range and his body was ""ice cold,"" according to jail records. He died at the hospital.According to Green's friends and family members, he was an insulin-dependent diabetic who stayed on top of the disease, keeping his medications in a case.Fulton County's chief jailer, Mark Adger said Green should have been taken directly to Grady after his arrest because his blood sugar was so high when he entered the jail. If that had occurred, he might have survived, Adger said.""My concern before he passed was when they checked his blood sugar, it was higher than I'd ever seen, and, for some reason, we decided to take him,"" Adger said.A prosecution declinedThe circumstances in several of the Georgia deaths are similar to those in the case of 20-year-old Morgan Angerbauer, who died of DKA in a Texarkana, Arkansas jail in 2016. The case made national headlines because a nurse, Brittany Johnson, pleaded guilty to negligent homicide and was sentenced to three months in jail herself.The prosecutor, Stephanie Barrett, told the AJC she had no hesitation in charging Johnson after jail video showed her refusing to check Angerbauer's blood sugar as the inmate begged for help.""If I saw something like this, someone just refusing when an inmate asked for help, I'd prosecute every time,"" she said. The AJC could find only one case in Georgia in which criminal charges were contemplated. A coroner's inquest in Whitfield County in 2009 ruled that the death of 39-year-old truck driver Barnes Nowlin Jr. was a homicide. Yet even then, the county's district attorney at the time, Kermit McManus, declined to prosecute.Nowlin died three days after being booked into the jail for failing to pay a fine for a traffic accident in which he clipped a mailbox and left the scene. He had driven to Dalton from his home in Rome to pay the fine, but he was taken into custody because he had missed an earlier court date.The GBI concluded that Nowlin died from natural causes. But it also found evidence that the nurse in charge left the jail just hours before Nowlin's death even though the nurse knew the inmate was a diabetic and that his health was failing.In statements to the GBI, two jailers said they told the nurse, Robert Pierce, that Nowlin had been vomiting and repeatedly falling down. In response, they said, Pierce instructed them to have Nowlin fill out a medical request form so he could be seen the next day.Pierce, in his statement to the GBI, confirmed the jailers' accounts but said he didn't believe Nowlin was in serious jeopardy. Pierce also noted that he had previously been admonished by his superiors for being ""too nice"" to inmates. At the inquest, jurors heard from a GBI deputy medical examiner, Dr. Jacqueline Martin, who testified that had Nowlin's blood sugar been tested at the time the officers expressed their concerns, it might have saved his life.""If they would have tested the sugar at an earlier time and it was noted that it was elevated, yes, this condition could have been treated,"" Martin testified.In 2012, Whitfield County, which employed Pierce, paid $850,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by Nowlin's wife.McManus, who retired in 2012, wrote in an email to the AJC that he didn't have an ""independent recollection"" of the case. Interviewed by the Dalton Daily Citizen-News at the time of the inquest, he downplayed the finding, saying it ""does not create a case and has no meaning whatsoever.""﻿Data specialist Jennifer Peebles contributed to this report.--Support real journalism.

The cost to taxpayersSome 80,000 people held in U.S. prisons or jails have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.If diabetics aren't provided with proper care, they can develop other serious health issues that are costlier to treat. Some state and local governments also have had to pay out hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to resolve lawsuits accusing them of deliberate indifference to the medical needs of diabetic inmates.What is Diabetic Ketoacidosis?Diabetic ketoacidosis, commonly known as DKA, is a serious and potentially fatal complication of diabetes that develops when the body can't produce enough insulin.The lack of insulin leads to severely elevated blood glucose levels, causing the body to break down fat as fuel. That turns the blood acidic. And that, if left untreated, causes organs to fail.DKA is more common for people with type 1 diabetes because they are totally insulin dependent, but it also can affect those with type 2.Symptoms include nausea and vomiting, frequent urination, thirst, weakness or fatigue and confusion. Treatment involves administering insulin and fluids.",https://t.co/bx4lRr5OOq,news
Oral delivery of biologics,"Both Rani Therapeutics and researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have separately developed orally administered capsules, the RaniPill and the self-orienting micro-applicator (SOMA), to replace the injections often required for biologics and insulin.Drug delivery of insulin has long been subcutaneous, often meaning that diabetic patients are required to inject themselves multiple times a day or rely on a pump. Additionally, patients requiring repeated dosing of biologics have also had to rely on injections.The drug delivery devices developed have the potential to remove the barrier that needle injection represents and would make the benefits of biological medicines more accessible for patients.Mechanism of action ​Both innovative pills have a specific mechanism of actions to enter the gastrointestinal tract and inject at specific points for optimal absorption.(Image: Rani Therapeutics)Mir Imran, CEO of Rani Therapeutics, told us, ""We started with the premise that injecting the drug into the intestinal wall would be ideal because there are no sharp-pain receptors in the intestine, rendering the injection painless. In addition, the intestinal w​all is highly vascularized, which means that the drug, once delivered, will be quickly absorbed.""​The enteric coating of Rani's RaniPill protects the capsule from the acidic environment of the stomach and instead dissolves in the intestine, which causes a pressure change and inflates the pill. The microneedles are then released into the vascular wall, providing a dosage with the same bioavailability of a subcutaneous injection.""Once the needle is delivered, all that is left is a deflated polymer, having the consistency of a bell pepper skin or tomato skin, which the patient passes out,""​ said Imran.The RaniPill can enable the delivery of biologics at any molecular weight, regardless of the drug's structure or properties, making it viable for therapeutic antibodies, as well as small peptides and proteins.A brave new world of drug delivery​Similarly, MIT's pill, SOMA, uses a micro-injector made of dried compressed insulin, which is powered by a tiny spring attached to a sugar disk to administer the insulin into the wall of the stomach.While the stomach wall is not as vascular as the intestinal wall and uptake is not as immediate, MIT researchers said that due to the muscular nature of the stomach, there is no danger in puncturing the stomach with a micro-needle.Getting the capsule to the right placement in the stomach presents a challenge, the SOMA can self-right itself in the stomach to ensure the needle is injected into the stomach epithelium, or stomach lining.While the RaniPill has moved into in-human safety and tolerability studies, the SOMA capsule is still in early stages and is waiting for preclinical studies to examine the effects of daily micro-injections in the stomach. MIT researchers stated that they hope to enter the drug delivery device into human testing within the next three years.",https://t.co/gIGgIu7bhA,news
The ER Doctor Ordered Insulin When She Was Hypoglycemic,"–Linda Crasco/Linda CIt's the middle of the night, and Joe* hears his seven-year-old daughter cry out. His wife, who gave birth to their second son only a few weeks before, is still sleeping beside him. Joe goes to comfort his daughter, who he assumes just had a nightmare. Instead, he finds she is confused, shaking, and soaked with sweat. Jessica was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was three, and Joe recognizes she is experiencing hypoglycemia. There is too much injected insulin in her system, and he knows he needs to give her some kind of sugary snack or drink to bring her blood sugar levels back up. But Jessica becomes combative and won't eat or drink.Frightened, Joe calls 911. While waiting for the ambulance, he wakes his wife. They agree that she should stay home with their other children. The local hospital is only five minutes away, he says, and he will call her if she should come.Want more type 1 diabetes-related news stories, and the chance to help type 1 diabetes research? Take a moment to join Glu now by clicking here: https://myglu.org/sign_up.The EMTs arrive, bundle Jessica onto a stretcher, and race her to the community hospital. Once there, Joe tells the triage nurse his daughter has type 1 diabetes and is hypoglycemic. The nurse uses a handheld glucose meter to measure her levels. When the doctor arrives, the nurse turns to him and says the reading was 300 mg/dL.""No"", says Joe. ""There is no way her blood sugar is that high. Her blood sugar is low. Something must be wrong with the meter.""The doctor ignores Joe and orders insulin.Joe panics, knowing that if they give his daughter a dose of insulin when her low blood sugar is so low, it could kill her.""No,"" he says again, his voice rising. ""She has low blood sugar. I won't allow you to give her insulin.""The doctor tells him, ""She is a type 1 diabetic; she needs insulin.""Joe steps between the doctor and his daughter, a move the doctor will later claim was aggressive. He requests an ambulance to another hospital. The doctor tells Joe he is interfering with his daughter's treatment, and the police will be called if he doesn't step away. Joe doesn't budge. A police officer arrives soon, and Joe and the doctor each give their side of the story. The officer asks the doctor to test with a different meter. ""What can it hurt?"" the officer asks.With a new meter, Jessica's blood glucose is tested, and it comes back in the twenties. Jessica is given glucagon and her condition improves.Joe still thinks of how close he came to losing his daughter that night. It took a police officer to prescribe the right treatment instead of the doctor, who didn't seem to know the symptoms of hypoglycemia. The next time you worry you're talking too much to others about your type 1 diabetes or asking too many questions of a doctor or nurse, just remember that you might be educating an ER doctor or a police officer who could make all the difference in a crisis.*We changed the father's name to protect the family's privacy.

The inventors of insulin sold their patent for a buck. Why is it so expensive?,"On March 22, 1922, the discovery of insulin was announced. Here's what happened after.That's Frederick Banting, photographed less than an hour before he left on a secret medical mission to Britain on February 22, 1941. He never made it; the plane crashed in Newfoundland.Toronto Star, March 22, 1922/viaA few years earlier, on March 22, 1922, Banting and his co-discover Charles Best announced the discovery of insulin, described in the Toronto Star as a ""diabetes cure."" But it wasn't a cure, it is just a replacement for the insulin that diabetics are not producing themselves, and they have to keep taking it forever.Fortunately, Banting and Best thought it should be available for everyone, so they sold the patent to the University of Toronto for one dollar. According to the Canadian Encyclopaedia: ""Arguably one of Canada's greatest contributions in the area of medical research, the discovery of insulin completely transformed the treatment of diabetes, saving millions of lives worldwide.""So on this 97th anniversary of its public announcement, why are there headlines like ""Americans are dying because they can't afford their insulin""? Bernie Sanders wondered this too, although he got the dates wrong:""Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all,"" he wrote. ""97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can't afford their medication. Outrageous.""In Canada, that same insulin costs $32. What's happening here?It turns out that in 1972 the University of Toronto sold Connaught Labs, which made insulin, to the Canada Development Corporation, which sold it to Sanofi, which is now one of the big producers. In 1982 Eli Lilly started selling genetically engineered synthetic insulin, and now, according to Wikipedia, ""The vast majority of insulin currently used worldwide is now biosynthetic recombinant 'human' insulin or its analogues.""OK, but even that patent would have expired. Except the companies keep making changes. According to T1International,Pharmaceutical companies take advantage of loopholes in the U.S. patent system to build thickets of patents around their drugs which will make them last much longer (evergreening). This prevents competition and can keep prices high for decades. Our friends at I-MAK recently showed that Sanofi, the maker of Lantus, is no exception. Sanofi has filed 74 patent applications on Lantus alone, that means Sanofi has created the potential for a competition-free monopoly for 37 years.So in the USA they can charge whatever they think they can get away with. As Christel Aprigliano, CEO of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition (DPAC), told Think Progress,""It's not sustainable,"" Aprigliano told ThinkProgress. ""It truly has become a perverted system in which the list price of a drug that is life essential for 8 million Americans just has become unaffordable… [and] the people who are paying the list price are the people who can afford it the least."" Aprigliano said she's heard time and again of diabetics being forced to choose between a life-saving drug and paying other bills, like rent or buying food.OK, it is not, as Dr. Brian Goldman notes, your great grandmother's insulin.Insulin itself has been modified chemically to make versions that work faster or last longer. The delivery system has changed a lot. Instead of needles and syringes, there are insulin pumps, pens and other methods.But on March 22 we should salute Frederick Banting, Charles Best and, I suppose, the dog that supplied the pancreatic extract that became the first supplier of insulin that saved millions of lives.Frederick Banting/ Photo F.W.W. Hipwell via Lloyd Alter/CC BY 2.0Why is this on TreeHugger? I am still inspired by the fact that they sold it for a buck.

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/MBqIOk9J22,news
'Your days are numbered!' House lawmakers get angry over insulin prices,"A House hearing on the affordability of insulin turned tense Wednesday, as visibly frustrated lawmakers repeatedly pressed pharmaceutical executives to explain how a drug patented for $1 ballooned to as much as $280 per vial for Americans.The hearing, by the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, was a rare display of bipartisanship as both Republicans and Democrats chastised the nation's three biggest insulin makers for high list prices.For their part, the company executives returned repeatedly to carefully scripted talking points. List prices can be high, they said, because of a convoluted system of rebates negotiated with prescription benefits plans. The officials also said that their companies were using much of their profits to develop other innovative products that would benefit diabetic patients. And they noted that their companies offered special pricing programs for people who qualify.But lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were having none of it. At one point, Schakowsky suggested illegal price collusion might even be in play, calling insulin costs ""curiously close"" and declaring ""you're in trouble.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" said Schakowsky, D-Illinois.""If you think you can out-talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" she said.Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, said the company will start as of June offering uninsured patients the ability to access insulin for $99 a month. But Rep. Joe Kennedy said the companies only seemed to be moving toward lowering costs when facing pressure from the public and potential regulation from Congress.""No one should be rationing insulin,"" Tregoning said at one point.""And they do every day!"" Kennedy, D-Mass., interrupted.Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which can be controlled by a person's diet, people with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections to regulate their blood sugar.John Locher/AP, FILEA woman with Type 2 diabetes prepares to inject herself with insulin at her home in Las Vegas, April 18, 2017.The Senate Finance Committee this year launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices, citing skyrocketing prices. According to that panel, the insulin drug NovoLog cost 87 percent more in 2019 compared to 2013, while Sanofi's Lantus drug jumped 77 percent. And Eli Lilly's drug Humalog increased 585 percent between 2001 and 2015.Republican Rep. David McKinley said he couldn't understand why a drug that had been around for nearly 100 years would suddenly spike in cost. The inventors of insulin originally sold the patent to the University of Toronto for a single dollar.""I'm a strong, strong supporter of innovation,"" said McKinley of West Virginia. ""But help me out a bit … Innovation is supposed to drive the price down, not up.""Doug Langa, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., which makes NovoLog, said drug companies are researching innovative ways to make life easier for diabetics patients, such as limiting the number of shots they need per day. He also said there were ""perverse"" incentives when it comes to pricing, noting the $18 billion a year his company spends on rebates, discounts and fees.""The higher the rebate, the higher the list price,"" he said.Tregoning of Sanofi said the money negotiated through rebates don't always make it back to the customer.""We don't have visibility on how those rebates are used,"" she told the panel.Rep. Diana DeGette, who chaired the hearing, said: ""it seems to me what is happening is that every component of the drug system is contributing to an upward pressure on the drug price.""",https://t.co/FDBd6okypU,news
Diabetes Winter Hacks: 7 Tips To Staying On Track During Cold Weather Season,"A big thanks to Miranda Lowery, CDE, RD, for stopping by with 7 tips for managing your diabetes even when the temperature drops.1. Keep your diabetes devices and insulin out of the coldJust like extreme heat, extreme cold can affect your insulin (insulin solutions freeze near 32 degrees Fahrenheit), and we recommend that you avoid exposing your insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor to weather below 34 degrees Fahrenheit. If you're outside in cold weather, wear your pump close to your body and cover it with an accessory or warm clothing. Just like in heat, freezing temperatures can break down insulin and cause it lose its effectiveness. Make sure your blood glucose (BG) meter is protected in a case, and bundled up too!2. Protect your immune systemWinter is flu season, and when you're sick, you're probably stressed, both of which can raise BG levels. Talk to your doctor about whether or not you should be getting an annual flu shot to help protect yourself against the flu. And wash your hands often with soap and water, or keep hand sanitizer nearby, so you don't spread germs. Just remember, hand sanitizer may have sugar alcohols so could affect your BG readings and dry out your hands, so make sure you wash them before you pull out your meter. If you do get sick, follow sick day rules provided by your healthcare team.3. Test, don't guessDramatic temperature changes may affect your BG levels. As the seasons change, pay close attention to your CGM trend, because you'll likely be experiencing different activities or schedules than other times during the year.4. Keep your hands warmCold weather can leave you with cold hands, making testing your BG more difficult. When your hands are warmer, it brings more blood to your fingers. Wearing gloves outside is one of the easiest ways to keep your hands warm during the cold months. There are also special mittens available that allow you to take the finger portion off, so you won't need to remove the full glove just to expose a finger. If your hands are cold before testing, warm them up on a warm mug or with warm soapy water.5. Don't stop movingCold weather can make us want to bundle up by the fire and skip our exercise routine, especially when the sun goes down earlier in the day. It's important to continue moving during the winter season to help keep your BG levels under control, keep you warm, and relax your mind. Look for ways to work in your daily exercise, such as walking at your local mall, joining a gym, trying activities you can do at home, taking up a new winter sport, or bundling up with a buddy and continuing your outdoor routine.6. Beat the winter bluesThe holiday season can be stressful, and the shorter winter days can affect your mood and emotions. Getting exercise, eating well, and keeping busy with the things you enjoy can help keep your spirits up. If you're having trouble with depression, talk to a peer and contact your healthcare team for help.7. Keep an eye on your feetWinter air can dry out and crack your skin, especially on your feet, which can open doors to wounds and infections. Be sure to protect your feet with the necessary winter footwear, especially in the snow and below freezing temperatures. Apply moisturizer to your feet to keep your skin healthy, and inspect them daily. If you notice an injury that isn't healing, be sure to contact your healthcare team immediately.What are your tips for managing your diabetes during the cold season?Guest Blogger – Miranda Lowery, CDE, RDMiranda Lowery is a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE), Registered Dietitian (RD), and Medtronic Diabetes Clinical Manager in Savannah, Georgia. Living with type 1 diabetes since the age of 2, she has dedicated her career to helping those living with diabetes learn to live a healthier, rewarding life with diabetes – ""control diabetes instead of letting diabetes control you.""

The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/hvjYj68n1V,news
'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/SyRGZAv5Vo,news
Drug prices are killing diabetics. 'Walmart insulin' isn't the solution.,"Much to the relief of insulin affordability advocates, who have been raising awareness about costs and pushing for policy changes, the public is increasingly aware of this crisis. But instead of working with advocates to rectify the situation, too many people are simply promoting older, cheaper insulin. This was evident in early February when a Facebook post touting ""Walmart insulin"" went viral. Such gestures come from a good place, but they put insulin-dependent people at greater risk and threaten to exacerbate the larger problem.It started on Feb. 4, when a news station in Texas shared a viewer's letter suggesting that struggling people should simply go to Walmart to purchase insulin without a prescription for $25. This viewer claimed that her husband buys three vials a month. The anchor admitted that he ""can't vouch for Linda"" but told viewers, ""Try it. Let me know if it works.""Keeping my kids with diabetes alive costs thousands of dollars a yearA woman watching snapped a photo of her television and shared it on Facebook with the comment, ""I don't use this but I hope it helps someone that does. Please talk with your Dr before making any changes in medications."" Within 24 hours, the post had 132,000 shares. It has since accumulated more than 12,000 comments, many of them tagging diabetics in the apparent hope of assisting those who are struggling with the cost of critical medications.But many people with Type 1 diabetes and their caregivers (I am one of the latter) cringed as the post went viral. It wasn't just comments like ""Yes this is true. I get it for my dog"" that irked us, but also that the advice signals a cavalier attitude toward diabetics' health.As those of us within the Type 1 diabetes community know, and as a subsequent Snopes entry clarified, ""Walmart"" insulin is an older form, one that few Type 1 diabetics use. The chain store sells short- and long-acting human insulin (commonly known as R and N), rather than short- and long-acting analog insulin, which is the variety that costs over $300 per vial. Human insulin was created in the 1970s to better imitate a human pancreas over the animal insulin that was initially used. While that might seem like a good thing, synthetic insulin poorly approximates the insulin secretion of a healthy pancreas. Among other things, it can take an hour to begin absorbing, while more recently developed rapid-acting analog insulin starts to take effect in 20 minutes or less after an injection.This means that, like midcentury patients, people on the older formulary experience a blood sugar spike after eating — which can lead to long-term complications — or must dose well before eating. Doing that requires a level of planning that is not always feasible at home, let alone in professional or educational settings.In 2016, Nicki Nichols blogged about the challenges of this regimen with her young daughter. ""Going out to dinner?"" she wrote. ""You must decide on your meal before you leave the house. If you're hungry for a snack, you must bolus the insulin and then wait an hour."" To avoid life-threatening hypoglycemia (low blood glucose, which can lead to seizures and other complications), Nichols had to compel her 5-year-old to eat every carbohydrate on her plate, even if she was already full. She also had to make her daughter eat by herself an hour before the family meal when ""her father wasn't even home yet.""Insulin is too expensive for many of my patients. It doesn't have to be.Another disparity between human and analog insulin is the duration in the bloodstream. Older human insulin can linger up to eight hours after meals, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia, especially during sleep. Many who've used this insulin report seizures and losing consciousness from drops in blood sugar, as well as frequent hospital visits.Despite all of this, proponents sometimes argue that financially struggling diabetics should use it for the simple reason that it will keep them alive. This claim is routinely lobbed by social media users who point to the family members of Alec Raeshawn Smith, Antavia Lee Worsham, Justin Lutgen and others who died after rationing analogues. Isn't being ""kept alive"" a rather low threshold for outcomes?The claim is also not necessarily true, as insulin advocate Mindi Patterson knows well. Her sister-in-law died within days of transitioning to human insulin. In June 2018, Meaghan Carter lost her insurance and couldn't afford to pay $900 a month for insulin. She managed to obtain the drug for a few months but then purchased a vial from Walmart in December. Carter did not have the physical or financial resources to succeed on human insulin. Having lived with diabetes for 18 years, she had developed high blood pressure and other heart problems, which may have left her poorly equipped to withstand the new regimen.Carter also lacked an endocrinologist to supervise her and an adequate supply of test strips to monitor her glucose levels. According to Patterson, Carter was down to half a bottle of strips when she died, and her glucose meter revealed that she was testing her levels only once daily in the days leading up to her death. Even off-label test strips can cost 40 cents each, and some diabetics test 10 or more times a day. This figure can be even higher for someone adjusting to dosing changes. Such an expense can be prohibitive for those living on the edge of their means, which is supposedly the whole point of switching to human insulin.Why prescription drug prices have skyrocketedYet there is something worse than seeing the public tout ""Walmart"" as a solution to high insulin costs: seeing the major diabetes organizations do so. Last year, the American Diabetes Association released a white paper in which it advised physicians to prescribe older insulins in cases where the patient cannot afford analogues, though it allowed that taking such an approach would require ""significant education"" of both health-care providers and diabetics. In a newsletter issued this week, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Association also recommended older formularies to patients needing assistance with drug costs.These suggestions give the lie to the organizations' own calls for reduced insulin prices, confuse the public and distract from advocates' efforts to reduce insulin prices. These calls are also alarming for the reason that the nonprofit T1International notes: They ""[exacerbate] a two-tiered system where the rich get the 'better insulin' and the poor are forced to use the older, and often more problematic, insulin."" (Disclosure: I volunteer for T1International.)Rather than telling the most vulnerable members of the community to seek outdated treatments, these organizations should pressure insulin manufacturers to lower list prices. Likewise, members of the public should support meaningful efforts to make insulin more affordable for all, perhaps including drug price transparency legislation, anti-competitive lawsuits, caps on drug prices, and the removal of barriers to importation. Calls to embrace human insulin, no matter how well-meaning, are only intensifying a problem that demands more sweeping solutions.Correction: An earlier version of this article gave the wrong decade for the creation of human insulin.",https://t.co/pJnyadsymT,news

Insulin Has Become Unaffordable. Patients Are Dying In Their Efforts To Ration Doses,"Find our buildout from this hour, featuring a partial transcription, here.With Meghna ChakrabartiSix million Americans rely on insulin to survive. Many can no longer afford it. What happens when big pharma, big profits and strong patent laws lead to dying patients?GuestsDylan Scott, health care reporter at Vox. ()Vikas Saini, cardiologist and president of the Lown Institute, a nonpartisan think tank dedicated to promoting health care equity. Co-chair of The Right Care Alliance. ()Dr. Kasia Lipska, endocrinologist and diabetes outcomes research at Yale School of Medicine. ()In The News: The Right Care Alliance Protests At Sanofi Offices In MassachusettsVikas Saini, left, speaks with On Point host Meghna Chakrabarti at a protest against high insulin prices at pharmaceutical company Sanofi's offices in Cambridge, Mass. (Anna Bauman/On Point)The Right Care Alliance held a protest against high insulin prices, which have led some to the dangerous practice of cutting doses to save, at Sanofi offices in Cambridge, Mass., Tuesday. (Anna Bauman/On Point)Statements From Insulin Manufacturers Eli Lilly, Sanofi And Novo NordiskEli LillyWe want to provide help for people who need it while not disrupting access for the thousands of Humalog patients who pay lower prices because of their insurance designs. The significant rebates we pay on insulins do not directly benefit all patients, and this needs to change. For people with diabetes, a lower-priced insulin can serve as a bridge that addresses gaps in the system until a more sustainable model is achieved.The current healthcare system operates on a high list price/high rebate model. Cutting the list prices would significantly disrupt the healthcare system for patients. Approximately 95 percent of people who use Humalog pay less than $100 for their monthly prescription because of their insurance design and or cost-savings programs. Lilly Insulin Lispro is a less disruptive approach to reducing list prices that still provides an answer for people who need help.SanofiSince 2012, the net price of Sanofi insulins has declined by 25 percent, yet patient out-of-pocket costs has continued to rise. Take Lantus, for example, our most prescribed insulin. The net price has fallen over 30 percent since 2012. Over this very same period, average out-of-pocket costs for patients with commercial insurance and Medicare has risen approximately 60 percent.Lastly, it's important to note that Sanofi has implemented new innovative programs to ensure individuals without insurance or those without adequate insurance have access to our medicines. The most notable is our Insulins Valyou Savings Program, which sets a fixed, deeply discounted price ($99 for each 10 mL vial or $149 for each box of pens) to help lower out-of-pocket costs for Sanofi insulins (Lantus, Toujeo, Admelog, and Apidra). For some patients with diabetes, the program could offer a savings of up to $3,000 per year.Again we really insist on the following for your coverage: anyone who is prescribed a Sanofi medicine, and who may be having financial challenges or trouble navigating their insurance, please call (800) 633-1610 where eligible patients can be connected to the resources they need at no cost.Novo NordiskWe know a growing number of Americans with diabetes struggle to pay for their healthcare, and this can include paying for medicines we make.One of the reasons for the disparity between list prices and net prices is the demand by payers for higher rebates. These increasing demands for rebates from payers allow Novo Nordisk to maintain and expand the availability of its medicines on formularies – the lists of medicines health plans cover – and ensure that patients have access. However, Novo Nordisk has no ability to control whether the rebates it pays to enable broader access to medicines result in lower out-of-pocket costs. What a patient pays at the pharmacy counter is also influenced by how one's insurance plan is designed, which causes those in high-deductible health plans to pay list prices.We've provided several offerings for some time to support people who have difficulty affording their insulin, including: Human insulin – the type of insulin used to establish the current diabetes standards of care – can be found at many national pharmacy chains for $25/vial. This has been used effectively to lower blood glucose for decades by millions of Americans and people around the world Co-pay cards to help defray the costs of those who are experiencing high out-of-pocket costs driven by list price, and A patient assistance program that, in 2018, provided free medicines to tens of thousands of people with diabetes who didn't have health insuranceBecause people are looking to us to continue innovating against this serious disease, we remain committed to identifying additional solutions to address access and affordability. It will require efforts from all parties in the US health care system to solve this challenge, and we want to be part of the solution.Ultimately, any solution has to make buying medicines easier for patients, and effectively work within the broader healthcare system.From The Reading ListWashington Post: ""Life, Death and Insulin"" — ""Insulin, in its various manufactured forms, has been used to treat diabetes for almost a century, since Canadian researchers isolated the hormone in a lab in 1921. Before their discovery, what we now know as Type 1 diabetes was fatal. Even after being put on starvation diets, patients often lived no more than a few years. The researchers who transformed diabetes treatment won the Nobel Prize, and they sold their patent to the University of Toronto for a total of $3. 'Above all, these were discoverers who were trying to do a great humanitarian thing, and they hoped their discovery was a kind of gift to humanity,' historian Michael Bliss told The Washington Post in 2016.""Soon, though, insulin became a commercial enterprise. By 1923, the American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly was manufacturing enough insulin for diabetics across North America. For decades, manufacturers improved formulas, first using animal parts, then producing human insulin using bacteria and recombinant DNA. The 1990s saw the advent of insulin analogs, synthetic drugs made to better mimic the body's own insulin production.""Today, critics argue that the price of insulin has far outpaced any innovations. In the past decade alone, U.S. insulin list prices have tripled, according to an analysis of data from IBM Watson Health. In 1996, when Eli Lilly debuted its Humalog brand of insulin, the list price of a 10-milliliter vial was $21. The price of the same vial is now $275. Those costs can be compounded by the multiple vials that diabetics may require to survive each month. 'It's a very big problem,' says Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. 'It's a tragic barrier to care.' ""Vox: ""Congress is grilling pharma CEOs. Here are 8 ideas for bringing down drug prices."" — ""Americans have said for years that they're frustrated with the price of medicine and it should be high on lawmakers' to-do list.

'Your days are numbered!' House lawmakers get angry over insulin prices,"A House hearing on the affordability of insulin turned tense Wednesday, as visibly frustrated lawmakers repeatedly pressed pharmaceutical executives to explain how a drug patented for $1 ballooned to as much as $280 per vial for Americans.The hearing, by the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, was a rare display of bipartisanship as both Republicans and Democrats chastised the nation's three biggest insulin makers for high list prices.For their part, the company executives returned repeatedly to carefully scripted talking points. List prices can be high, they said, because of a convoluted system of rebates negotiated with prescription benefits plans. The officials also said that their companies were using much of their profits to develop other innovative products that would benefit diabetic patients. And they noted that their companies offered special pricing programs for people who qualify.But lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were having none of it. At one point, Schakowsky suggested illegal price collusion might even be in play, calling insulin costs ""curiously close"" and declaring ""you're in trouble.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" said Schakowsky, D-Illinois.""If you think you can out-talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" she said.Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, said the company will start as of June offering uninsured patients the ability to access insulin for $99 a month. But Rep. Joe Kennedy said the companies only seemed to be moving toward lowering costs when facing pressure from the public and potential regulation from Congress.""No one should be rationing insulin,"" Tregoning said at one point.""And they do every day!"" Kennedy, D-Mass., interrupted.Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which can be controlled by a person's diet, people with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections to regulate their blood sugar.John Locher/AP, FILEA woman with Type 2 diabetes prepares to inject herself with insulin at her home in Las Vegas, April 18, 2017.The Senate Finance Committee this year launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices, citing skyrocketing prices. According to that panel, the insulin drug NovoLog cost 87 percent more in 2019 compared to 2013, while Sanofi's Lantus drug jumped 77 percent. And Eli Lilly's drug Humalog increased 585 percent between 2001 and 2015.Republican Rep. David McKinley said he couldn't understand why a drug that had been around for nearly 100 years would suddenly spike in cost. The inventors of insulin originally sold the patent to the University of Toronto for a single dollar.""I'm a strong, strong supporter of innovation,"" said McKinley of West Virginia. ""But help me out a bit … Innovation is supposed to drive the price down, not up.""Doug Langa, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., which makes NovoLog, said drug companies are researching innovative ways to make life easier for diabetics patients, such as limiting the number of shots they need per day. He also said there were ""perverse"" incentives when it comes to pricing, noting the $18 billion a year his company spends on rebates, discounts and fees.""The higher the rebate, the higher the list price,"" he said.Tregoning of Sanofi said the money negotiated through rebates don't always make it back to the customer.""We don't have visibility on how those rebates are used,"" she told the panel.Rep. Diana DeGette, who chaired the hearing, said: ""it seems to me what is happening is that every component of the drug system is contributing to an upward pressure on the drug price.""",https://t.co/0IhMzqih5l,news
Diabetics struggle as drug prices soar,"Struggling to stay alive: Rising insulin prices cause diabetics to go to extremes The escalating cost of insulin has desperate diabetics rationing medication, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from Canada or Mexico. Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY Corrections &amp; Clarifications: This story has been updated to reflect royalty payments for a 1923 patent.Meaghan Carter died alone on the sofa of her suburban Dayton, Ohio, apartment last Christmas.Like most people with Type 1 diabetes, the 47-year-old nurse had a kit of essential supplies within reach.

She was scheduled to begin a new nursing job the following week that offered health insurance.""There was no insulin at all in the refrigerator,"" says Mindi Patterson, Carter's sister-in-law. ""She had gauze, bandages and all her nursing supplies. She had plenty to take care of others but not enough to take care of herself."" She buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive in the US Deidre Waxman buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive for her on MedicareErin Clark and Jasper Colt, USA TODAYThe cost of insulin for diabetics such as Carter has drawn national scrutiny as Congress examines factors contributing to the nation's escalating prescription drug prices. All people with Type 1 and some with Type 2 diabetes need the drug, but regular price hikes make insulin difficult to afford for the uninsured and those whose coverage requires significant cost sharing.Patient advocates are becoming increasingly vocal about the affordability of a drug invented nearly a century ago by scientists who took steps to make the medicine inexpensive. One group staged protests outside the offices of the nation's three dominant insulin makers.Canadian scientists discovered insulin in 1921, treated the first diabetic patient in 1922 and sold the patent to the University of Toronto for 3 Canadian dollars. The university administered the patent and received royalty payments from drug companies that sold human insulin.The price of modern versions of a drug that more than 7 million Americans need to live nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013, according to one study. Type 1 diabetics paid an average of $5,705 for insulin in 2016 – nearly double what they paid in 2012, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.Diedre Waxman lives in Newton, Mass., and has Type 1 diabetes. Diagnosed six years ago, Waxman has adopted a strict diet, so she doesn't need as much insulin, which she purchases from Canada.Erin Clark for USA TODAYPatient advocates say people have resorted to extreme measures such as taking less than the doctor prescribed to make it last longer, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from less expensive pharmacies in Canada or Mexico.More: Lack of insulin could affect 40 million people with diabetes by 2030, study findsLast month, the powerful Senate Finance Committee asked the three dominant insulin makers detailed questions about the drugs' price increases. The price for one vial of Eli Lilly's Humalog surged from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015. From 2013 to this year, Novo Nordisk's Novolog jumped from $289 to $540 and Sanofi's Lantus from $244 to $431, according to a committee letter.A vial of insulin loses potency after being opened for 28 days. The amount of insulin a patient needs varies depending on such factors as age, weight, diet and overall health.Among things senators want to know: How do drugmakers set insulin prices, and what's the role of rebates and discounts to middlemen pharmacy benefit managers?Senators are not limiting questions to Big Pharma. The nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, who drew scrutiny for their increasingly powerful role as middlemen in the drug supply chain, will appear before the committee April 3.Drugmakers say they've taken steps to address prices, offered co-pay cards to limit out-of-pocket expenses and funded patient-assistance programs that provide free medication to thousands of vulnerable Americans.Sanofi pledged to limit annual price increases to less than the average health spending rate.This month, Eli Lilly unveiled a half-price version of Humalog called insulin lispro for $137.50 for a single vial. It's the same drug as Humalog, only with a different label.In a statement, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the lower-cost insulin is a ""bridge that addresses gaps in the system until a more sustainable model is achieved.""Simeon Taylor, a University of Maryland School of Medicine diabetes researcher, says Type 1 diabetics without adequate insurance coverage are vulnerable to price increases because they can't live without the drug.""Insulin is not an optional medication,"" says Taylor, who formerly worked for Eli Lilly and the National Institutes of Health. ""People have to buy insulin no matter what the cost is. That gives a lot of strength to the people selling insulin.""'Whole system needs to be evaluated'Some suggest that a simple across-the-board price cut might not work for all patients under the system.The American Diabetes Association convened an Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group to study rising insulin prices and affordability of the life-sustaining medicine. The group's study concluded that a complex supply chain from the drug factory to the pharmacy might promote higher prices.Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers, demand rebates from drug manufacturers. Their leverage: placing the drug on an insurer's formulary – the list of drugs that the insurance company will cover for insured consumers.A drugmaker that offers a lower rebate might be excluded from a prescription drug plan or be placed on a less favorable tier that requires consumers to pay a larger portion on the tab.More: Insulin costs nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, report saysThe ADA's working group's report found that even though drugmakers' ""list prices"" for insulin have surged, their ""net prices"" have grown at a more modest rate. The list price is how much the drugmaker charges. The net price is money the drugmaker gets after fees, discounts and rebates to wholesalers or pharmacy benefit managers.Consumers are not privy to these behind-the-scenes negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers and drug manufacturers. All of this is done outside the public's view.""A lot of attention has focused on the manufacturers and less on the other players in the supply chain,"" says Karen Van Nuys, a research professor at USC's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and member of the ADA's working group. ""We think those players also share responsibility for what happens to prices and access.""Van Nuys says that if one drugmaker lowers insulin prices, that could put it at a competitive disadvantage compared with peers. That is because pharmacy benefit managers might still require a significant rebate.Novo Nordisk says its insulin net prices declined at double-digit rates in 2017 and 2018 because of rebate demands.""The whole system needs to be evaluated,"" Van Nuys says.Study: Cost affects insulin useNewton, Massachusetts, resident Deidre Waxman has good prescription-drug coverage through Medicare.But she worries that the $1,300 to $1,500 monthly retail cost of her insulin will be unaffordable if she reaches the doughnut hole, Medicare's deductible that kicks in once drug spending exceeds $3,820.She does not fill insulin prescriptions at her neighborhood pharmacy; she gets her medicine from Canada. Her husband buys insulin during his frequent work trips there, and she will take a six-hour car trip to Canada once a year to get insulin. A third source is Mark's Marine, a Vancouver, British Columbia, pharmacy that ships to U.S. patients.Waxman does not need much insulin because she is on a low-carbohydrate diet. If she has excess insulin, she packs it in styrofoam containers cooled with ice packs and sends it to fellow diabetes patients who can't afford the drug.""I send it to friends who are in dire need,"" Waxman says. ""These are people who would die without insulin.""Diedre Waxman's diabetes bag includes the pen she loads with cartridges to administer her insulin.Erin Clark for USA TODAYFor those without robust insurance coverage, there are signs they are having difficulty affording insulin.Kasia Lipska is an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. Lipska noticed that more Yale Diabetes Center patients seemed to struggle to pay for insulin, so doctors surveyed patients about whether cost influenced their insulin use.One in four patients responded that cost prompted them to use less insulin than prescribed, take smaller doses, stretch out supplies, not fill a prescription or not start the drug. It was a small study at one center in Connecticut, and researchers can't be certain whether insulin affordability is better or worse in other states.People who struggle to pay are ""more in the middle,"" Lipska says. They don't qualify for Medicaid, the state insurance plan for low-income residents, and some earn too much to qualify for patient-assistance programs.A person with Type 1 diabetes who discontinues the drug might get sick, hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis or die, she says.More: Eli Lilly to introduce generic version of insulin drug Humalog that cuts price in halfThe health problems of diabetics who take less than they need might take longer to detect but can be just as serious.Taking less insulin than prescribed can lead to serious health harms, Lipska says. Those could include a diabetic ulcer, a foot infection that leads to amputation or kidney damage.""We know it's a problem,"" Lipska says. ""The problem leads to, in very severe cases, patients dying, people having complications, people being admitted to the hospital.""'You realize you don't have any left'Blind in one eye and her vision rapidly deteriorating in the other, Sarah Theubet could not afford the medicine her body needed to slow the harmful effects of diabetes.Insulin was too expensive.

As these middlemen gained more clout, they began to demand higher rebates. Drug companies raised prices by amounts that are slightly less than what pharmacy benefit managers demanded.""This is a symptom of a dysfunctional health care system in the United States,"" Taylor says.

The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/KLUw1zYpwU,news
'Your days are numbered!' House lawmakers get angry over insulin prices,"A House hearing on the affordability of insulin turned tense Wednesday, as visibly frustrated lawmakers repeatedly pressed pharmaceutical executives to explain how a drug patented for $1 ballooned to as much as $280 per vial for Americans.The hearing, by the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, was a rare display of bipartisanship as both Republicans and Democrats chastised the nation's three biggest insulin makers for high list prices.For their part, the company executives returned repeatedly to carefully scripted talking points. List prices can be high, they said, because of a convoluted system of rebates negotiated with prescription benefits plans. The officials also said that their companies were using much of their profits to develop other innovative products that would benefit diabetic patients. And they noted that their companies offered special pricing programs for people who qualify.But lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were having none of it. At one point, Schakowsky suggested illegal price collusion might even be in play, calling insulin costs ""curiously close"" and declaring ""you're in trouble.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" said Schakowsky, D-Illinois.""If you think you can out-talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" she said.Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, said the company will start as of June offering uninsured patients the ability to access insulin for $99 a month. But Rep. Joe Kennedy said the companies only seemed to be moving toward lowering costs when facing pressure from the public and potential regulation from Congress.""No one should be rationing insulin,"" Tregoning said at one point.""And they do every day!"" Kennedy, D-Mass., interrupted.Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which can be controlled by a person's diet, people with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections to regulate their blood sugar.John Locher/AP, FILEA woman with Type 2 diabetes prepares to inject herself with insulin at her home in Las Vegas, April 18, 2017.The Senate Finance Committee this year launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices, citing skyrocketing prices. According to that panel, the insulin drug NovoLog cost 87 percent more in 2019 compared to 2013, while Sanofi's Lantus drug jumped 77 percent. And Eli Lilly's drug Humalog increased 585 percent between 2001 and 2015.Republican Rep. David McKinley said he couldn't understand why a drug that had been around for nearly 100 years would suddenly spike in cost. The inventors of insulin originally sold the patent to the University of Toronto for a single dollar.""I'm a strong, strong supporter of innovation,"" said McKinley of West Virginia. ""But help me out a bit … Innovation is supposed to drive the price down, not up.""Doug Langa, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., which makes NovoLog, said drug companies are researching innovative ways to make life easier for diabetics patients, such as limiting the number of shots they need per day. He also said there were ""perverse"" incentives when it comes to pricing, noting the $18 billion a year his company spends on rebates, discounts and fees.""The higher the rebate, the higher the list price,"" he said.Tregoning of Sanofi said the money negotiated through rebates don't always make it back to the customer.""We don't have visibility on how those rebates are used,"" she told the panel.Rep.

Intensive intervention fails to improve insulin persistence in type 2 diabetes,"Increasing the focus and intensity of an intervention for a targeted group of adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes did not increase the likelihood that they would continue to fill prescriptions for insulin, according to study results.However, a modest improvement in glycemic control was observed in the targeted group compared an unselected group of patients who received a lower-intensity intervention.""Given that more intensive interventions tend to result in larger improvements in adherence, focusing only on individuals most likely to benefit may allow more resources to be devoted to fewer individuals without increasing overall costs of an intervention program,"" Julie C. Lauffenburger, PharmD, PhD, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and an associate epidemiologist in the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and colleagues wrote. ""A more potent effect for a comparatively small subgroup may also make it more likely to observe population-level effects when appropriately analyzing quality improvement trials using intention-to-treat principles, even though patient acceptance of interventions may be less than 30%.""Lauffenburger and colleagues analyzed data from 6,000 adults with type 2 diabetes prescribed basal insulin therapy insured by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey between July 7, 2016, and Oct. 5, 2017 (mean age, 56 years; 59.8% men). Researchers assigned participants to one of three arms, based on HbA1c level, with arms designed to be equivalently priced to mirror the type of choice a health insurer would make to allocate funds for a quality improvement program (costs were determined by Magellan Rx Management). Arm 1 offered a low-intensity intervention to all patients, with all participants receiving a letter informing them about pharmacist outreach, a reminder postcard and a small pillbox, along with two follow-up phone calls. Arm 2 offered a moderate-intensity intervention to 60% of patients (n = 1,200) based on their predicted risk for insulin nonadherence, and included up to six follow-up calls and two calls with a patient's primary care physician or pharmacy to clarify treatment issues or receive recommendations for therapeutic changes. Patients were also offered enrollment in a weekly text messaging program focused on medication-taking behaviors.Arm 3 offered a high-intensity intervention to 40% of patients (n = 800) based on glycemic control and predicted risk for insulin nonadherence, including up to 12 follow-up calls and PCPs or pharmacists called as often as necessary. Patients were also offered text messages delivered weekly, every 3 days or daily. ""Arm 3 was designed to mimic the most intensive type of strategy that a telephone-based disease management program could offer,"" the researchers wrote. Primary outcome was continuing to fill prescriptions for insulin. Secondary outcomes were changes in HbA1c and health care utilization. Researchers evaluated outcomes in arms 2 and 3 vs. arm 1 using claims data, intention-to-treat principles and multiple imputation for missing values during 12 months of follow-up.Among targeted patients, 24.7% in arm 1, 30.7% in arm 2 and 34.3% in arm 3 completed a telephone consultation with a pharmacist.Patients with an initial consultation received a mean of 1.7 calls in arm 1, 1.8 calls in arm 2 and 2.1 calls in arm 3.

Increasing the focus and intensity of an intervention for a targeted group of adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes did not increase the likelihood that they would continue to fill prescriptions for insulin, according to study results.However, a modest improvement in glycemic control was observed in the targeted group compared an unselected group of patients who received a lower-intensity intervention.""Given that more intensive interventions tend to result in larger improvements in adherence, focusing only on individuals most likely to benefit may allow more resources to be devoted to fewer individuals without increasing overall costs of an intervention program,"" Julie C.

Researchers assigned participants to one of three arms, based on HbA1c level, with arms designed to be equivalently priced to mirror the type of choice a health insurer would make to allocate funds for a quality improvement program (costs were determined by Magellan Rx Management). Arm 1 offered a low-intensity intervention to all patients, with all participants receiving a letter informing them about pharmacist outreach, a reminder postcard and a small pillbox, along with two follow-up phone calls. Arm 2 offered a moderate-intensity intervention to 60% of patients (n = 1,200) based on their predicted risk for insulin nonadherence, and included up to six follow-up calls and two calls with a patient's primary care physician or pharmacy to clarify treatment issues or receive recommendations for therapeutic changes. Patients were also offered enrollment in a weekly text messaging program focused on medication-taking behaviors.Arm 3 offered a high-intensity intervention to 40% of patients (n = 800) based on glycemic control and predicted risk for insulin nonadherence, including up to 12 follow-up calls and PCPs or pharmacists called as often as necessary. Patients were also offered text messages delivered weekly, every 3 days or daily.PAGE BREAK""Arm 3 was designed to mimic the most intensive type of strategy that a telephone-based disease management program could offer,"" the researchers wrote.

Sanofi to cut U.S. insulin costs for some patients to $99 per month,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanofi SA said on Wednesday it will cut the cost of its insulin products to $99 per month for uninsured patients and others who pay cash for it in the United States, as the French drugmaker contends with intense criticism over the high price of the life-sustaining diabetes medication. FILE PHOTO - The logo of Sanofi is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Charles PlatiauSanofi announced the plan hours before one of its executives was set to testify before a congressional committee on the rising prices of insulin. Executives from the other leading insulin producers - Eli Lilly &amp; Co and Novo Nordisk A/S - will also testify. The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five-year period, leading some patients to put their own health at risk by rationing the medication. Under its plan, Sanofi said people with diabetes in the United States can buy up to 10 boxes of insulin pens or vials with a valid prescription for $99 per month, beginning in June. The price of other manufacturers' leading insulin products is $178 to $300 per vial and $235 to $563 per pack of pens, according to Sanofi. The move is an expansion of Sanofi's ""Insulin Valyou Savings Program"" launched last year and represents a significant savings for patients already enrolled who had been paying $99 for each vial of insulin and $149 for each pack of insulin pens. ""When you hear us say in our testimony in the hearing tomorrow that it is heartbreaking and no one should have to go without insulin, we mean it,"" Michelle Carnahan, Head of North America primary care at Sanofi, said in an interview on Tuesday. Sanofi is not the first company to cut insulin prices in response to intensifying criticism from patients and politicians. Last month, Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a half price, authorized generic version of its popular Humalog insulin injection. The list price for Lilly's authorized generic, to be sold only in the United States, will be $137.35 per vial. Patients with high out-of-pocket insulin costs can participate in the Sanofi program regardless of their income level, Sanofi said. Under current regulations, it can not offer the plan to patients insured under the government's Medicare or Medicaid programs or similar federal and state health programs. In terms of profitability, Sanofi said it believes the pricing program is sustainable for the long term. The company's diabetes business brought in about 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in U.S. sales last year. Since Sanofi launched its ""Insulins Valyou Savings Program"" last April around 12,000 patients have utilized the program, saving about $10 million, the company said.

The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/LQt5dbJLxq,news
"US Researchers Explore Link Between Sugar, Insulin, Keto, and Cancer","Diet fads- we know them, we try them, we love them, we hate them. Among today's top trending diet is the low carb regimen known as ""keto"". What started out as a diet fad among celebrities like Lebron James and Halle Berry, turned into the most googled diet on the internet in 2018. (1) But there are more benefits to the keto diet than the notion of losing weight. There's now been an exciting discovery within the research of cancer potentially linking the ketogenic diet to an anti-cancer drug. The increasing evidence behind the findings are taking the medical media by storm. The Link Between Sugar and Cancer U.S Cancer researcher, Lewis Cantley, Ph.D., and his team led a research program where an anti-cancer drug was paired with the ketogenic diet. The theory was intended to starve cancer cells of the necessary glucose and insulin that's required in order to grow and spread. Cantley's work began in the 1980s when he initially discovered an enzyme known as PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase). Known as the 'master switch' by many scientists, PI3K has been involved in approximately 80% of all cancers. (2)The study, which was featured in The Medical Express, stated, ""It turned out that the gene that encodes the PI3K is the most frequently mutated cancer-promoting gene in humans – and in the years since Dr. Cantley's revolutionary discovery. It has been implicated in as many as 80 percent of cancers, including those of the breast, brain, and bladder."" (3) PI3K is responsible for bridging the gap between insulin being released in the body, cell glucose utilization, growth, and survival. In instances of cancer, the process works overtime. This allows for the sugar-addicted cancer cells to collect more glucose, which is exactly what they need to survive and thrive. The ResearchThe study was conducted using mice that were genetically engineered to develop pancreatic, bladder, endometrial, and breast cancers. When treated with a new PI3K inhibitor, the researchers noted spikes of insulin reactivated the pathway in tumors, overall countering the anti-cancer effect of the drug. However, tumors shrank when researchers combined the medication with a diet that restricted carbohydrates. The researchers noted, ""Our preclinical research suggests that if somewhere in your body you have one of these PI3K mutations and you eat a lot of rapid-release carbohydrates, every time your insulin goes up, it will drive the growth of a tumor. The evidence really suggests that if you have cancer, the sugar you're eating may be making it grow faster."" (2)The Future of KetoKetosis is known as a state in which the body relies on the metabolism of fat to be used as the primary source of fuel. The fat is used to supply energy demands as opposed to the preferred source of energy known as glucose. (1) The metabolic process of ketosis has been practiced since the early 20th century serving as a treatment to minimize seizures for epilepsy patients. Since then the processes of ketosis has evolved, which has resulted in mammals being able to survive food shortages. From Cantley's studies, the keto diet has taken on a whole new meaning. With the potential to aid in further cancer research and treatment, his research has shifted to clinical trials in humans. This new addition to cancer therapies means we now are gaining a sharper understanding with the correlation of glucose and insulin when utilizing the ketogenic diet. While there's a vast amount of research that will need to be done, these exciting findings within cancer research leave many helpful.",https://t.co/jfKrIuKGDC,news

According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/RayBHuddP2,news
'Your days are numbered!' House lawmakers get angry over insulin prices,"A House hearing on the affordability of insulin turned tense Wednesday, as visibly frustrated lawmakers repeatedly pressed pharmaceutical executives to explain how a drug patented for $1 ballooned to as much as $280 per vial for Americans.The hearing, by the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, was a rare display of bipartisanship as both Republicans and Democrats chastised the nation's three biggest insulin makers for high list prices.For their part, the company executives returned repeatedly to carefully scripted talking points. List prices can be high, they said, because of a convoluted system of rebates negotiated with prescription benefits plans. The officials also said that their companies were using much of their profits to develop other innovative products that would benefit diabetic patients. And they noted that their companies offered special pricing programs for people who qualify.But lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were having none of it. At one point, Schakowsky suggested illegal price collusion might even be in play, calling insulin costs ""curiously close"" and declaring ""you're in trouble.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" said Schakowsky, D-Illinois.""If you think you can out-talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" she said.Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, said the company will start as of June offering uninsured patients the ability to access insulin for $99 a month. But Rep. Joe Kennedy said the companies only seemed to be moving toward lowering costs when facing pressure from the public and potential regulation from Congress.""No one should be rationing insulin,"" Tregoning said at one point.""And they do every day!"" Kennedy, D-Mass., interrupted.Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which can be controlled by a person's diet, people with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections to regulate their blood sugar.John Locher/AP, FILEA woman with Type 2 diabetes prepares to inject herself with insulin at her home in Las Vegas, April 18, 2017.The Senate Finance Committee this year launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices, citing skyrocketing prices. According to that panel, the insulin drug NovoLog cost 87 percent more in 2019 compared to 2013, while Sanofi's Lantus drug jumped 77 percent. And Eli Lilly's drug Humalog increased 585 percent between 2001 and 2015.Republican Rep. David McKinley said he couldn't understand why a drug that had been around for nearly 100 years would suddenly spike in cost. The inventors of insulin originally sold the patent to the University of Toronto for a single dollar.""I'm a strong, strong supporter of innovation,"" said McKinley of West Virginia. ""But help me out a bit … Innovation is supposed to drive the price down, not up.""Doug Langa, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., which makes NovoLog, said drug companies are researching innovative ways to make life easier for diabetics patients, such as limiting the number of shots they need per day. He also said there were ""perverse"" incentives when it comes to pricing, noting the $18 billion a year his company spends on rebates, discounts and fees.""The higher the rebate, the higher the list price,"" he said.Tregoning of Sanofi said the money negotiated through rebates don't always make it back to the customer.""We don't have visibility on how those rebates are used,"" she told the panel.Rep. Diana DeGette, who chaired the hearing, said: ""it seems to me what is happening is that every component of the drug system is contributing to an upward pressure on the drug price.""",https://t.co/lDZrIbBj7a,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits.

The Blame Game: Everyone And No One Is Raising Insulin Prices,"A casual observer of Wednesday's House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing might think insulin prices just go up by themselves.After all, the key industry executives filed opening statements to the congressional panel outlining patient-assistance programs, coupons and discounts — a range of price reductions that might make one think this life-or-death diabetes medication is easily affordable to the patients who need it.In fact, the price of insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016 alone, triggering national headlines about the resulting hardships — sometimes deadly — suffered by people with the Type I-version of the condition who are left to ration insulin because it is too expensive for them to use as prescribed.The three drug manufacturers that make insulin — Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi — joined three pharmacy benefit managers — CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx — to testify before the Oversight and Investigations panel at its second hearing probing the corporate maneuvers behind the skyrocketing costs.Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are the go-between companies that negotiate with drugmakers on which medicines will make insurance plans' lists of covered drugs and how much insurers' plans will pay for them.The subcommittee members came looking for a fight. The often-contentious hearing featured Republicans and Democrats alike hammering the witnesses about prices, repeatedly asking questions: Why not just lower the list price? Do you really think the market is working? How do you sleep at night?""I want to congratulate all of you today for accomplishing something we've been trying to do in Congress, and that is to create bipartisanship,"" said Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), who isn't even on the committee but came to ask questions, anyway. ""This is going to end. I have witnessed it. I have seen what you've done.""Chairwoman Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) asked each of the witnesses the direct question: Why were insulin prices rising?In response, manufacturers and PBMs pointed fingers at one another while seated at the same witness table.The manufacturers cast rebates as the root of the problem. Rebates are discounts paid by a drugmaker to a PBM, and those savings are generally not passed on to the customer at the pharmacy counter.""Seventy-five percent of our list price is paid in rebates and discounts to secure access,"" said Mike Mason, a senior vice president for Eli Lilly.But PBM executives had a very different view.""I have no idea why the prices are so high, none of it is the fault of rebates,"" said Amy Bricker, a senior vice president for Express Scripts.Manufacturers painted themselves as victims, saying they were forced to raise their list prices to compensate for the ever-growing rebates demanded by PBMs to keep their insulin on drug formularies (the list of drugs covered under an insurance plan).But then PBMs saw things very differently. The real drivers of the sky-rocketing costs are the high list prices set by manufacturers along with the lack of generic alternatives, noted Dr. Sumit Dutta, OptumRx senior vice president and chief medical officer. And the PBMs also claimed to wear the white hat in this battle because without their rebate system prices would go up and no one would be advocating for patients.Overall, the subcommittee members seemed exasperated by these circular arguments.The response when Eli Lilly's Mason mentioned his company's recently introduced lower-priced insulin highlighted this impatience.""It took 15 years and global public outcry to do it?"" said Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), who was visibly frustrated that none of the drugmakers could explain how prices were set.Subcommittee members also pounded the executives on some traditional weak spots, topics such as CEO pay and corporate profits.Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) asked each witness what they were willing to give up for patients to have access to less expensive drugs. He interrupted each answer, telling them the status quo isn't good enough.""Somebody's getting richer,"" Ruiz said. ""Somebody is making money on the backs of our patients.""",https://t.co/3MooUGaidi,news
Critical Care Medicine,"Insulin infusion therapy is commonly used in the hospital setting to manage diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Clinical evidence suggests both hypoglycemia and glycemic variability negatively impact patient outcomes. The hypothesis of this study was that moderate-intensity insulin therapy decreases hospital length of stay and prevalence of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Pre-post study. Large academic medical center in the United States. Two-hundred one consecutive, nonpregnant, adult patients admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state between October 2010 and December 2014. High-intensity insulin therapy versus moderate-intensity insulin therapy. High-intensity insulin therapy was designed to rapidly normalize blood glucose levels with bolus doses of insulin and rapid insulin titration. Moderate-intensity insulin therapy was designed to mitigate glycemic variability and hypoglycemia through avoidance of bolus dosing, a liberalized blood glucose target, and gradual insulin titration. Hospital and ICU length of stay were reduced by 23.6% and 38%, respectively. The relative risk of remaining in the hospital at day 7 (0.51; p = 0.022) and day 14 (0.28; p = 0.044) were significantly reduced by the moderate-intensity insulin therapy strategy. The relative risk of remaining in the ICU at 48 hours was significantly lower in the moderate-intensity insulin therapy cohort (0.34; p = 0.0048). The prevalence (35% vs 1%; p = 0.0003) and relative risk (0.028; p = 0.0004) of hypoglycemia were significantly lower in the moderate-intensity insulin therapy cohort. Glycemic variability decreased by 28.6% (p &lt; 0.0001). There was no difference in the time to anion gap closure (p = 0.123). Moderate-intensity insulin therapy for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state resulted in improvements in hospital and ICU length of stay, which appeared to be associated with decreased glycemic variability. 1Department of Pharmacy Services, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA. 2Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Kentucky Healthcare, Lexington, KY. 3Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/3YnTjNYwR3,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it.

The inventors of insulin sold their patent for a buck. Why is it so expensive?,"On March 22, 1922, the discovery of insulin was announced. Here's what happened after.That's Frederick Banting, photographed less than an hour before he left on a secret medical mission to Britain on February 22, 1941. He never made it; the plane crashed in Newfoundland.Toronto Star, March 22, 1922/viaA few years earlier, on March 22, 1922, Banting and his co-discover Charles Best announced the discovery of insulin, described in the Toronto Star as a ""diabetes cure."" But it wasn't a cure, it is just a replacement for the insulin that diabetics are not producing themselves, and they have to keep taking it forever.Fortunately, Banting and Best thought it should be available for everyone, so they sold the patent to the University of Toronto for one dollar. According to the Canadian Encyclopaedia: ""Arguably one of Canada's greatest contributions in the area of medical research, the discovery of insulin completely transformed the treatment of diabetes, saving millions of lives worldwide.""So on this 97th anniversary of its public announcement, why are there headlines like ""Americans are dying because they can't afford their insulin""? Bernie Sanders wondered this too, although he got the dates wrong:""Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all,"" he wrote. ""97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can't afford their medication. Outrageous.""In Canada, that same insulin costs $32. What's happening here?It turns out that in 1972 the University of Toronto sold Connaught Labs, which made insulin, to the Canada Development Corporation, which sold it to Sanofi, which is now one of the big producers. In 1982 Eli Lilly started selling genetically engineered synthetic insulin, and now, according to Wikipedia, ""The vast majority of insulin currently used worldwide is now biosynthetic recombinant 'human' insulin or its analogues.""OK, but even that patent would have expired. Except the companies keep making changes. According to T1International,Pharmaceutical companies take advantage of loopholes in the U.S. patent system to build thickets of patents around their drugs which will make them last much longer (evergreening). This prevents competition and can keep prices high for decades. Our friends at I-MAK recently showed that Sanofi, the maker of Lantus, is no exception. Sanofi has filed 74 patent applications on Lantus alone, that means Sanofi has created the potential for a competition-free monopoly for 37 years.So in the USA they can charge whatever they think they can get away with. As Christel Aprigliano, CEO of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition (DPAC), told Think Progress,""It's not sustainable,"" Aprigliano told ThinkProgress. ""It truly has become a perverted system in which the list price of a drug that is life essential for 8 million Americans just has become unaffordable… [and] the people who are paying the list price are the people who can afford it the least."" Aprigliano said she's heard time and again of diabetics being forced to choose between a life-saving drug and paying other bills, like rent or buying food.OK, it is not, as Dr. Brian Goldman notes, your great grandmother's insulin.Insulin itself has been modified chemically to make versions that work faster or last longer. The delivery system has changed a lot. Instead of needles and syringes, there are insulin pumps, pens and other methods.But on March 22 we should salute Frederick Banting, Charles Best and, I suppose, the dog that supplied the pancreatic extract that became the first supplier of insulin that saved millions of lives.Frederick Banting/ Photo F.W.W. Hipwell via Lloyd Alter/CC BY 2.0Why is this on TreeHugger? I am still inspired by the fact that they sold it for a buck.

Deborah Winzar claims sepsis killed her husband Dominic McCarthy,"Ex-nurse who was found guilty of murdering her husband with insulin claims he died of sepsis as she bids to have her conviction quashed after 15 years in prisonDeborah Winzar served 15 years imprisonment for murdering Dominic McCarthyIt was ruled Winzar murdered her paralysed husband via an insulin overdoseThe former nurse maintains it was sepsis that killed Mr McCarthy and not her Her case is now being appealed in the Criminal Cases Review Commission By Arthur Martin for the Daily Mail Published: 11:46 AEST, 19 March 2019 | Updated: 15:26 AEST, 19 March 2019 A nurse who was found guilty murdering her disabled husband by injecting him with insulin could have her conviction quashed with her lawyers set to argue he died of sepsis.Deborah Winzar, 54, was jailed for life at Birmingham Crown Court in 2000 after being found guilty of the murder of her husband Dominic McCarthy.Mr McCarthy, who was paralysed in a motorcycle accident in 1984, was found collapsed in his bed at the home the couple shared in Stonely, Cambridgeshire, in January 1997.Deborah Winzar (left) was convicted in 2000 for murdering husband Dominic McCarthy (right) Winzar, then a senior ward sister at Kettering General Hospital, denied any wrongdoing and maintained that her husband must have died of natural causes.But a post-mortem examination revealed that Mr McCarthy had a very high level of insulin in his blood and the prosecution's case was that his wife had the opportunity and skill to inject it.Winzar, pictured, was released from prison after 15 years and remains committed to clearing her name. Her lawyers claim new medical evidence indicates Mr McCarthy may have died of sepsis. Mr McCarthy (right) became a paralysed in a motorcycle accident in 1984 Her case has been referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice. Senior judges adjourned her case yesterday for medical evidence to be obtained.Presiding judge, Lord Justice Irwin, said the case has an 'extraordinary history. We cannot go on middling this case, there has to be a decisive conclusion'. Justice William Davis said that the case will examine whether a 'natural succession of events' led to dangerously low blood sugar levels 'and therefore death' was responsible.However, James Curtis, prosecuting, said Mr McCarthy's death 'was not caused by some internal sudden lightning strike with the body turning in on itself'.A previous challenge to Winzar's conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in December 2002. The CCRC previously said the new evidence 'gives rise to a real possibility' her conviction will be quashed.A new hearing date has not been set.

The morbidity and mortality from these conditions confer a greater economic societal burden. Epidemiological research associates insulin resistance in the etiology of these diseases, but there is limited evidence for the mechanism of damage. Emerging research suggests that hyperinsulinemia, a symptom of insulin resistance, may cause these pathological changes, and therefore be an independent contributor to these diseases. This review shows that hyperinsulinemia, or excessive insulin secretion, should be considered independently to insulin resistance, defined as glucose uptake rate, even though the two conditions are intertwined and will co-exist under normal conditions. Hyperinsulinemia directly and indirectly contributes to a vast array of metabolic diseases including all inflammatory conditions, all vascular diseases, gestational and type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity and certain cancers and dementias. The mechanisms include increased production of: insulin growth factor-1; reactive oxidative species and advanced glycation end-products; and triglyceride and fatty acids. Hyperinsulinemia also directly and indirectly affects many other hormones and cytokine mechanisms including leptin, adiponectin and estrogen. There is limited research standardizing the hyperinsulinemia diagnostic process. Methodological concerns and lack of standardized reference ranges preclude the use of fasting insulin. Most research has also focused on insulin resistance and it is unknown whether these methods translate to hyperinsulinemia. No Supplementary Material available for this article.

Their Tax Rate Is 0%,"The number of companies paying no taxes has risen for two main reasons. First, the Trump tax law expanded some corporate tax breaks, such as the one for the purchase of machinery and vehicles. Second, the law reduced the top-line corporate tax rate, which means that some companies now have a low enough tax bill that they can wipe it out entirely with tax breaks. Altogether, the law led to a 31 percent decline in corporate-tax revenue last year. That decline has helped cause an increase in the deficit. As the law professors Rebecca Kysar and Linda Sugin have written, the Trump tax cut is financed ""on the backs of future generations.""I think some decline in the top-line corporate-tax rate — which was higher than in most other countries — was justified. But the Trump tax cut didn't go about it in the right way. It cut the rate too steeply and kept, or expanded, too many tax breaks. A better bill would have paired a more gentle decline in the rate with a tougher approach to tax breaks, essentially trying to level the playing field among companies. Even before the law change, American companies weren't actually paying very much in taxes.""At a time when the public's confidence in our elected officials and our institutions is especially low, the specter of big corporations avoiding all income taxes on billions in profits sends a strong and corrosive signal to Americans: that the tax system is stacked against them, in favor of corporations and the wealthiest Americans,"" writes Matthew Gardner, the lead author of the Institute on Taxation report.BuzzFeed responseBen Smith, the editor of BuzzFeed News, emailed me Friday, taking objection to that day's newsletter, in which I described one of BuzzFeed's Trump-Russia stories as dubious. I was referring to BuzzFeed's January story that claimed Trump ""directed"" and ""personally instructed"" Michael Cohen, his former personal lawyer, to lie about talks about a Trump Tower in Moscow.Smith wrote to me that ""the underlying claim — that Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress — has been backed up in Cohen's own testimony, revelations about the edits Trump and his lawyers made, a congratulatory phone call he received after giving his false testimony, and more."" He added: ""We have unearthed more facts than any other news outlet about the details of the Trump Tower Moscow deal — feel free to dig in here — and continue to stand by the Cohen story, with good reason.""I still disagree. Since BuzzFeed's story (which Robert Mueller's office disputed), Cohen has said that Trump used code words and implication to get him to lie. If BuzzFeed or another media organization were doing the same story today, I think the language would be different in important ways. But I'm always happy to highlight substantive disagreement with my arguments, and I appreciate that Smith took the time to write.I'd also note that BuzzFeed News has been doing excellent journalism, both on Russia and other subjects.If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

Medtronic Guardian Connect CGM and Diabetes Time in Range,"Just in case you forgot, Medtronic Diabetes does in fact have a stand-alone continuous glucose monitor (CGM) on the market. Share on PinterestThe Medtronic Guardian Connect was FDA-approved and launched last Spring, and rolled out over the latter months of 2018. But not many in the D-Community had been talking about it much because, well... Medtronic really hadn't been doing that either. Until now, when they've come forward with bold messaging around how this device can improve outcomes for people with diabetes. The company didn't promote this product -- its first stand-alone CGM since its ""Real-Time"" product back in 2007 -- at anywhere near the level of publicity for their full Medtronic Minimed 670G hybrid closed loop. That system uses the same CGM sensor connected to a Medtronic insulin pump with an algorithm that auto-regulates insulin dosing to keep blood sugars in range.While Medtronic is the long-time market leader in insulin pumps, the Guardian Connect was meant to expand their customer base by offering a CGM option to PWDs (people with diabetes) who don't wish to use a pump. It is a direct competitor to other CGMs on the market, including the popular Dexcom G6, the Abbott Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitor, and the newest Eversense implantable three-month CGM from Senseonics. Still, the company's been awfully quiet about it, until recently, when their diabetes division began posting more ads and news bits about the stand-alone CGM. It was part of the news in early April, when headlines hit that Medtronic had entered into a ""value-based outcomes agreement"" with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, where Medtronic's US headquarters is based. Measuring Diabetes Outcomes via ""Time in Range""That Blue Shield deal allows members with diabetes to get the Guardian Connect CGM as a ""pharmacy benefit,"" which makes it easier to access and more affordable. But what's really unique is that the two organizations have agreed to use a metric other than the gold standard A1C test to measure members' success using this device. Diabetes advocates and innovators have been pushing to move ""beyond A1C"" for a number of years now.A Medtronic spokeswoman tells us proudly that Guardian Connect becomes the first-ever stand-alone CGM using ""Time in Range"" as the key metric. Their press release explains:""Time in Range (TIR) is a standard measurement in diabetes management that tracks the amount of time a person's glucose is in their target range with 70-180 mg/dL being the standard range. Spending more Time in Range helps minimize both short- and long-term health complicationsfrom going too high or low. Results from an analysis of people who used the predictive alerts feature on the Guardian Connect system showed that they experienced fewer high events 39 percent of the time (vs. 10% without alerts) and fewer low events 60% of the time (vs. 33% without alerts)."" Medtronic has also been promoting a TIR infographic:Share on PinterestWith Blue Cross Blue Shield, they are actually tying insurance payments to the amount of time users spend in this healthy glucose range -- an approach known as ""value-based payments."" So if a Medtronic CGM user does not manage to stay in that ideal 70-180 mg/dL range for a certain amount of time when using the device, then Medtronic will actually pay back the cost to the insurance company.Just how much time must be spent in range?""We have not publicly disclosed the Time in Range levels outlined in the agreement,"" Medtronic Diabetes Communications Program Manager Kendra Cassillo told us via email. Hmmm... Wins and Losses for Medtronic DiabetesA big win for Medtronic here is that they come out looking like a champion (and even innovator?) of the Time In Range metric and moving Beyond A1C. They're also at the forefront of moving to value-based payments that link insurance coverage directly to patients' health results.Yes, Medtronic Diabetes has done something similar before, with a 2017 deal guaranteeing they would pay back treatment costs for patients who did not do well using their Minimed 670G. However, that was aimed at covering emergency-related and hospitalization costs in extreme cases of hypoglycemia or DKA. This latest TIR agreement illustrates that they are also willing to stick their neck out to guarantee success in the daily D-management of eligible BCBS-MN members using Medtronic's Guardian Connect.Medtronic has also introduced a new ""gamified"" incentive program for BCBS-MN members using either the stand-alone CGM or 670G system, called Inner Circle that awards users points for the time they spend in the target range. This is certainly an interesting experiment on Medtronic's part. (More details on that below). On the downside, many have criticized Medtronic for making exclusive agreements with other insurance carriers that may unfairly push their products and restrict patient choice. Specifically, the United Healthcare (UHC) deal granting ""preferred"" status to Medtronic device users that was first announced in May 2016 for adults, and expanded in 2018 for kids and teens. That is specific to the Minimed 670G, and we've heard countless stories from the D-community where patients are being told that non-Medtronic devices are not covered at all, despite UHC's official word that an appeal process is in place to allow members to gain access to other insulin pump brands. About the Medtronic Guardian Connect CGM As a refresher, here are the basics on the Guardian Connect stand-alone CGM:Different Transmitter: The meat of this system is a new transmitter, that has the same seashell-shape design as other Medtronic CGM models but has Bluetooth Low Energy built in. That allows it to beam glucose data directly to the smartphone every five minutes. The transmitter has a 12-month warranty and is rechargeable. It costs $620 cash-price.Same Sensor: Yes, this system uses the same Guardian 3 sensor that goes with the Minimed 670G here in the US (while internationally, the stand-alone CGM uses an older-generation MedT sensor). The Guardian 3 sensor is approved for seven days of wear, and most recently in February 2018, it was FDA-cleared for wear on the upper arm along with the abdomen. A box of five sensors costs $345 at cash-price (with a 20% discount applied for cash purchases).Not Pump-Connected: As a result of the above-mentioned change in the transmitter, this system doesn't connect with Minimed insulin pumps. Medtronic is working to develop next-generation versions of its 630G and 670G devices that will have built-in BLE and allow for direct data-sharing, but as of now we're told that is not expected until roughly the end of March 2020.CGM App: The Guardian Connect mobile app is free, though it's only available for iOS users right now. An Android version of the mobile app is in development, but timing's still TBD.Touchscreen: In true iPhone form, you can use your finger to trace CGM data lines, and expand or contract the view of glucose results for whatever period of time you're looking at.Customizable Alerts: Users can set the predictive alert for any timeframe they wish, from 10 minutes to 60 minutes in advance of a predicted low or high blood sugar. You can also program different glucose thresholds and alerts for different times of day (i.e. Day vs. Night, or any other two periods of the user's choosing).Sugar.IQ App: This is a separate mobile app that Guardian Connect CGM'ers have ""exclusive access"" to. It's the IBM Watson app that Medtronic's been talking about for a few years now and launched to a small beta-testing group in Fall 2017. The app uses IBM Watson analytics to find patterns in diabetes data and offers real-time, actionable and personalized insights, which includes a circular graph reflecting TIR data and a ""Glycemic Assistant"" with food info. Results from its 250-person limited preview program at the ADA Scientific Sessions in 2017 showed 60% were using the app more than once a day, with TIR increasing 2.6% on average and fewer hypos as a result of the mobile app use. Sugar.IQ will pull info from Medtronic's Carelink platform.Inner Circle Gamification: First launched in August 2018, this app uses gamification principles to encourage behavior changes that help PWDs achieve better outcomes, focused on Time In Range as well as ""personalized challenges."" There's also a community forum weaved into it to let users share their tracked progress. As part of the new BCBS-MN agreement, users who take part in the Inner Circle program can earn up to $300 a year to offset the cost of their CGM and sensors. Medicare Coverage for Medtronic's CGM?We also asked Medtronic where it stands in pursuing Medicare coverage for its Guardian 3 CGM. Spokes-folks tell us the company expects to file a ""non-adjunctive designation claim"" with the FDA in the next few months. That means if OK'd by regulators, the sensor would be approved for use in making dosing and treatment decisions, without the need for a glucose fingerstick test to verify results.Dexcom was first to get this vote of confidence, followed by Abbott Libre, and Medicare officials have now stated that this ""dosing claim"" is their criteria for allowing a CGM to be considered valid for coverage.These are great updates to hear, though we are cautiously optimistic whenever it comes to anything related to Medtronic. Investor analysts point out that the company has been known to over-promise and under-deliver at times, particularly as it relates to timelines or next-gen product iterations. Their 670G system and stand-alone Guardian Connect seem to be working out well for some in the D-community, based on what we read and hear, but there is still a large gap many point to when it comes to performance versus other CGMs on the market.",https://t.co/AWkpGVZYNX,news
'Your days are numbered!' House lawmakers get angry over insulin prices,"A House hearing on the affordability of insulin turned tense Wednesday, as visibly frustrated lawmakers repeatedly pressed pharmaceutical executives to explain how a drug patented for $1 ballooned to as much as $280 per vial for Americans.The hearing, by the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, was a rare display of bipartisanship as both Republicans and Democrats chastised the nation's three biggest insulin makers for high list prices.For their part, the company executives returned repeatedly to carefully scripted talking points. List prices can be high, they said, because of a convoluted system of rebates negotiated with prescription benefits plans. The officials also said that their companies were using much of their profits to develop other innovative products that would benefit diabetic patients. And they noted that their companies offered special pricing programs for people who qualify.But lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were having none of it. At one point, Schakowsky suggested illegal price collusion might even be in play, calling insulin costs ""curiously close"" and declaring ""you're in trouble.""""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" said Schakowsky, D-Illinois.""If you think you can out-talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered,"" she said.Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, said the company will start as of June offering uninsured patients the ability to access insulin for $99 a month. But Rep. Joe Kennedy said the companies only seemed to be moving toward lowering costs when facing pressure from the public and potential regulation from Congress.""No one should be rationing insulin,"" Tregoning said at one point.""And they do every day!"" Kennedy, D-Mass., interrupted.Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which can be controlled by a person's diet, people with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections to regulate their blood sugar.John Locher/AP, FILEA woman with Type 2 diabetes prepares to inject herself with insulin at her home in Las Vegas, April 18, 2017.The Senate Finance Committee this year launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices, citing skyrocketing prices. According to that panel, the insulin drug NovoLog cost 87 percent more in 2019 compared to 2013, while Sanofi's Lantus drug jumped 77 percent. And Eli Lilly's drug Humalog increased 585 percent between 2001 and 2015.Republican Rep. David McKinley said he couldn't understand why a drug that had been around for nearly 100 years would suddenly spike in cost. The inventors of insulin originally sold the patent to the University of Toronto for a single dollar.""I'm a strong, strong supporter of innovation,"" said McKinley of West Virginia. ""But help me out a bit … Innovation is supposed to drive the price down, not up.""Doug Langa, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., which makes NovoLog, said drug companies are researching innovative ways to make life easier for diabetics patients, such as limiting the number of shots they need per day. He also said there were ""perverse"" incentives when it comes to pricing, noting the $18 billion a year his company spends on rebates, discounts and fees.""The higher the rebate, the higher the list price,"" he said.Tregoning of Sanofi said the money negotiated through rebates don't always make it back to the customer.""We don't have visibility on how those rebates are used,"" she told the panel.Rep. Diana DeGette, who chaired the hearing, said: ""it seems to me what is happening is that every component of the drug system is contributing to an upward pressure on the drug price.""",https://t.co/V5xLozI1uZ,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/2oBW56KZWV,news
Intensive intervention fails to improve insulin persistence in type 2 diabetes,"Increasing the focus and intensity of an intervention for a targeted group of adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes did not increase the likelihood that they would continue to fill prescriptions for insulin, according to study results.However, a modest improvement in glycemic control was observed in the targeted group compared an unselected group of patients who received a lower-intensity intervention.""Given that more intensive interventions tend to result in larger improvements in adherence, focusing only on individuals most likely to benefit may allow more resources to be devoted to fewer individuals without increasing overall costs of an intervention program,"" Julie C. Lauffenburger, PharmD, PhD, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and an associate epidemiologist in the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and colleagues wrote.

Diabetics struggle as drug prices soar,"Struggling to stay alive: Rising insulin prices cause diabetics to go to extremes The escalating cost of insulin has desperate diabetics rationing medication, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from Canada or Mexico. Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY Corrections &amp; Clarifications: This story has been updated to reflect royalty payments for a 1923 patent.Meaghan Carter died alone on the sofa of her suburban Dayton, Ohio, apartment last Christmas.Like most people with Type 1 diabetes, the 47-year-old nurse had a kit of essential supplies within reach. It contained two empty vials of her preferred insulin, a partial vial of inexpensive Walmart insulin and a half-filled container of testing strips to measure blood glucose levels.Uninsured, between jobs and with $50 in a bank account, Carter probably had attempted to stretch a limited supply of insulin until she got a final paycheck from her last job, family members say. She was scheduled to begin a new nursing job the following week that offered health insurance.""There was no insulin at all in the refrigerator,"" says Mindi Patterson, Carter's sister-in-law. ""She had gauze, bandages and all her nursing supplies. She had plenty to take care of others but not enough to take care of herself."" She buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive in the US Deidre Waxman buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive for her on MedicareErin Clark and Jasper Colt, USA TODAYThe cost of insulin for diabetics such as Carter has drawn national scrutiny as Congress examines factors contributing to the nation's escalating prescription drug prices. All people with Type 1 and some with Type 2 diabetes need the drug, but regular price hikes make insulin difficult to afford for the uninsured and those whose coverage requires significant cost sharing.Patient advocates are becoming increasingly vocal about the affordability of a drug invented nearly a century ago by scientists who took steps to make the medicine inexpensive. One group staged protests outside the offices of the nation's three dominant insulin makers.Canadian scientists discovered insulin in 1921, treated the first diabetic patient in 1922 and sold the patent to the University of Toronto for 3 Canadian dollars. The university administered the patent and received royalty payments from drug companies that sold human insulin.The price of modern versions of a drug that more than 7 million Americans need to live nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013, according to one study. Type 1 diabetics paid an average of $5,705 for insulin in 2016 – nearly double what they paid in 2012, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.Diedre Waxman lives in Newton, Mass., and has Type 1 diabetes. Diagnosed six years ago, Waxman has adopted a strict diet, so she doesn't need as much insulin, which she purchases from Canada.Erin Clark for USA TODAYPatient advocates say people have resorted to extreme measures such as taking less than the doctor prescribed to make it last longer, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from less expensive pharmacies in Canada or Mexico.More: Lack of insulin could affect 40 million people with diabetes by 2030, study findsLast month, the powerful Senate Finance Committee asked the three dominant insulin makers detailed questions about the drugs' price increases. The price for one vial of Eli Lilly's Humalog surged from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015. From 2013 to this year, Novo Nordisk's Novolog jumped from $289 to $540 and Sanofi's Lantus from $244 to $431, according to a committee letter.A vial of insulin loses potency after being opened for 28 days. The amount of insulin a patient needs varies depending on such factors as age, weight, diet and overall health.Among things senators want to know: How do drugmakers set insulin prices, and what's the role of rebates and discounts to middlemen pharmacy benefit managers?Senators are not limiting questions to Big Pharma. The nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, who drew scrutiny for their increasingly powerful role as middlemen in the drug supply chain, will appear before the committee April 3.Drugmakers say they've taken steps to address prices, offered co-pay cards to limit out-of-pocket expenses and funded patient-assistance programs that provide free medication to thousands of vulnerable Americans.Sanofi pledged to limit annual price increases to less than the average health spending rate.This month, Eli Lilly unveiled a half-price version of Humalog called insulin lispro for $137.50 for a single vial. It's the same drug as Humalog, only with a different label.In a statement, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the lower-cost insulin is a ""bridge that addresses gaps in the system until a more sustainable model is achieved.""Simeon Taylor, a University of Maryland School of Medicine diabetes researcher, says Type 1 diabetics without adequate insurance coverage are vulnerable to price increases because they can't live without the drug.""Insulin is not an optional medication,"" says Taylor, who formerly worked for Eli Lilly and the National Institutes of Health. ""People have to buy insulin no matter what the cost is. That gives a lot of strength to the people selling insulin.""'Whole system needs to be evaluated'Some suggest that a simple across-the-board price cut might not work for all patients under the system.The American Diabetes Association convened an Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group to study rising insulin prices and affordability of the life-sustaining medicine. The group's study concluded that a complex supply chain from the drug factory to the pharmacy might promote higher prices.Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers, demand rebates from drug manufacturers. Their leverage: placing the drug on an insurer's formulary – the list of drugs that the insurance company will cover for insured consumers.A drugmaker that offers a lower rebate might be excluded from a prescription drug plan or be placed on a less favorable tier that requires consumers to pay a larger portion on the tab.More: Insulin costs nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, report saysThe ADA's working group's report found that even though drugmakers' ""list prices"" for insulin have surged, their ""net prices"" have grown at a more modest rate. The list price is how much the drugmaker charges. The net price is money the drugmaker gets after fees, discounts and rebates to wholesalers or pharmacy benefit managers.Consumers are not privy to these behind-the-scenes negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers and drug manufacturers. All of this is done outside the public's view.""A lot of attention has focused on the manufacturers and less on the other players in the supply chain,"" says Karen Van Nuys, a research professor at USC's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and member of the ADA's working group. ""We think those players also share responsibility for what happens to prices and access.""Van Nuys says that if one drugmaker lowers insulin prices, that could put it at a competitive disadvantage compared with peers. That is because pharmacy benefit managers might still require a significant rebate.Novo Nordisk says its insulin net prices declined at double-digit rates in 2017 and 2018 because of rebate demands.""The whole system needs to be evaluated,"" Van Nuys says.Study: Cost affects insulin useNewton, Massachusetts, resident Deidre Waxman has good prescription-drug coverage through Medicare.But she worries that the $1,300 to $1,500 monthly retail cost of her insulin will be unaffordable if she reaches the doughnut hole, Medicare's deductible that kicks in once drug spending exceeds $3,820.She does not fill insulin prescriptions at her neighborhood pharmacy; she gets her medicine from Canada. Her husband buys insulin during his frequent work trips there, and she will take a six-hour car trip to Canada once a year to get insulin. A third source is Mark's Marine, a Vancouver, British Columbia, pharmacy that ships to U.S. patients.Waxman does not need much insulin because she is on a low-carbohydrate diet. If she has excess insulin, she packs it in styrofoam containers cooled with ice packs and sends it to fellow diabetes patients who can't afford the drug.""I send it to friends who are in dire need,"" Waxman says. ""These are people who would die without insulin.""Diedre Waxman's diabetes bag includes the pen she loads with cartridges to administer her insulin.Erin Clark for USA TODAYFor those without robust insurance coverage, there are signs they are having difficulty affording insulin.Kasia Lipska is an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. Lipska noticed that more Yale Diabetes Center patients seemed to struggle to pay for insulin, so doctors surveyed patients about whether cost influenced their insulin use.One in four patients responded that cost prompted them to use less insulin than prescribed, take smaller doses, stretch out supplies, not fill a prescription or not start the drug. It was a small study at one center in Connecticut, and researchers can't be certain whether insulin affordability is better or worse in other states.People who struggle to pay are ""more in the middle,"" Lipska says. They don't qualify for Medicaid, the state insurance plan for low-income residents, and some earn too much to qualify for patient-assistance programs.A person with Type 1 diabetes who discontinues the drug might get sick, hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis or die, she says.More: Eli Lilly to introduce generic version of insulin drug Humalog that cuts price in halfThe health problems of diabetics who take less than they need might take longer to detect but can be just as serious.Taking less insulin than prescribed can lead to serious health harms, Lipska says. Those could include a diabetic ulcer, a foot infection that leads to amputation or kidney damage.""We know it's a problem,"" Lipska says. ""The problem leads to, in very severe cases, patients dying, people having complications, people being admitted to the hospital.""'You realize you don't have any left'Blind in one eye and her vision rapidly deteriorating in the other, Sarah Theubet could not afford the medicine her body needed to slow the harmful effects of diabetes.Insulin was too expensive. The uninsured Redding, California, resident could not afford the cost of a drug that had more than tripled since the early 2000s.""It was terrifying,"" Theubet says. ""You are looking at the vial, and you realize you don't have any left.""Theubet turned to friends she met through social media in 2016 and 2017 to solicit insulin donations while she drastically changed her diet so she would not need as much medicine.She ate one low-carbohydrate meal each day that rarely varied: sliced lunch meat and cheese, no bread.She barely had enough energy to make it through classes at Shasta Community College. Vision in her right eye, stabilized this decade from an operation, began to worsen because she could not afford to take insulin as prescribed.

As these middlemen gained more clout, they began to demand higher rebates. Drug companies raised prices by amounts that are slightly less than what pharmacy benefit managers demanded.""This is a symptom of a dysfunctional health care system in the United States,"" Taylor says. ""I don't want to put all the blame on the companies. From my point of view, the responsibility is in how our health care system is designed.""More: Big Pharma CEOs tell senators they won't reduce drug costs without other changesCarter, the Dayton-area resident, was hospitalized twice for complications this decade and struggled to afford insulin months before she died, Patterson says.She spent $25 to buy Novolin NPH insulin from Walmart on Dec. 20, according to a receipt the family retrieved from her apartment after her death. Novolin is an older version of human insulin that must be adjusted based on regular blood and glucose testing.""I told her it was pretty unpredictable,"" Patterson says of Novolin. ""You only use it if you have no other option.""Carter was struggling on Christmas Day, feeling nauseous and slurring her words, a roommate told Huber Heights police.The roommate told police she thought Carter's blood-sugar levels were off and urged her to call a doctor or a paramedic.Carter refused, and the roommate left for work. When the roommate returned from work that night, she noticed Carter appeared to be sleeping on the sofa. The following morning, the roommate checked on Carter and realized she had died. The Montgomery County Coroner determined Carter died on Christmas night, but the agency did not consider the death suspicious and did not perform an autopsy. Carter often did not take her insulin as directed, the roommate told police. A family doctor signed her death certificate, listing the cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest.Patterson, whose husband and two sons have Type 1 diabetes, is convinced her sister-in-law experienced a type of complication called diabetic ketoacidosis before she died.She says she desperately wants to see a reformed system so patients can afford the medication they need to live.""The system is broken,"" Patterson says.

Why Is Insulin So Expensive In The U.S.?,"A nurse in 1938 checks the amount of insulin in a needle. For many decades, the only insulin available to people with diabetes came from the pancreases of cattle or pigs. Insulin from animals is still available outside the U.S. — and cheaper than a recombinant DNA version. Bettmann/Corbis hide caption toggle caption Bettmann/Corbis A nurse in 1938 checks the amount of insulin in a needle. For many decades, the only insulin available to people with diabetes came from the pancreases of cattle or pigs. Insulin from animals is still available outside the U.S. — and cheaper than a recombinant DNA version. Bettmann/Corbis Dr. Jeremy Greene sees a lot of patients with diabetes that's out of control. In fact, he says, sometimes their blood sugar is ""so high that you can't even record the number on their glucometer."" Greene, a professor of medicine and history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, started asking patients at his clinic in Baltimore why they had so much trouble keeping their blood sugar stable. He was shocked by their answer: the high cost of insulin. Greene decided to call some local pharmacies, to ask about low-cost options. He was told no such options existed. ""Only then did I realize there is no such thing as generic insulin in the United States in the year 2015,"" he says. Greene wondered why that was the case. Why was a medicine more than 90 years old so expensive? He started looking into the history of insulin, and has published a paper about his findings in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The story of insulin, it turns out, starts back in the late 1800s. That's when scientists discovered a link between diabetes and damaged cells in the pancreas — cells that produce insulin. In the early 1920s, researchers in Toronto extracted insulin from cattle pancreases and gave it to people who had diabetes, as part of a clinical trial. The first patient was a 14-year-old boy, who made a dramatic recovery. Most others recovered as well. Soon, insulin from pigs and cattle was being produced and sold on a massive scale around the world. Acids, alcohol and pancreatic tissue were separated, bathed and mixed in this laboratory of a 1946 insulin factory in Bielefeld, Germany. Chris Ware/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chris Ware/Getty Images Acids, alcohol and pancreatic tissue were separated, bathed and mixed in this laboratory of a 1946 insulin factory in Bielefeld, Germany. Chris Ware/Getty Images But for some, the early forms of the medicine weren't ideal. Many people required multiple injections every day, and some developed minor allergic reactions. Over the next few decades, scientists figured out how to produce higher-quality insulin, Greene says. They made the drug purer, so recipients had fewer bad reactions. They also made the substance able to last longer in the bloodstream, which led to more stable blood sugar levels and less frequent injections. ""All of these innovations helped to make insulin a little bit safer, a little bit more effective,"" Greene says. Then, in the 1970s, scientists developed a new technique they could use for insulin production, called recombinant DNA technology. It involves putting the human gene for insulin into bacteria, which then produce large quantities of the hormone. Then, a funny thing happened, Greene says: ""The older [animal] insulin, rather than remaining around on the market as a cheaper, older alternative, disappeared from the market."" Greene says there's no one reason that companies stopped producing the older animal versions, but they clearly felt it would not be profitable. Dr. Kevin Riggs, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins and co-author of the new insulin study, says the newer, recombinant version of insulin may have had some advantages in terms of convenience and fewer side effects. But there was probably something else at work — doctors being influenced by marketing. ""A lot of time we get caught up in some of the hype,"" Riggs says. ""When a new medicine comes out and it has theoretical advantages, we buy into that and think newer is better."" The company that made the new form of insulin, called Humulin, launched a large marketing effort aimed at doctors and patients shortly after its release. But newer drugs aren't always better, says Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of medicine and pharmacology at Georgetown University. That's partly because drug companies don't have to prove that a new drug is better than what is already on the market — they just have to prove that it's not worse. Insulin made via recombinant DNA technology in 2009. SIU/Visuals Unlimited/Corbis hide caption toggle caption SIU/Visuals Unlimited/Corbis Insulin made via recombinant DNA technology in 2009. SIU/Visuals Unlimited/Corbis ""In government-funded studies that have compared older drugs to newer drugs, often older drugs come out looking better or equal to newer drugs,"" Fugh-Berman says. For example, some patients have found that animal-derived forms of insulin work better for them, she says. They cause less variability in blood sugar, and fewer episodes of hypoglycemia. And while those older kinds of insulin are not available in the U.S., they are available elsewhere. ""In Canada, there actually is still an animal-derived insulin on the market, and that was really due to the efforts of consumer advocates,"" Fugh-Berman says. As the older versions have vanished in the U.S., newer versions have stayed expensive. The drug can cost up to $400 a month. Because of that high cost, many of the estimated 29 million people living with diabetes in the U.S. can't afford it. Some industry analysts expect insulin costs to fall in the future. That's because the most recent insulin patents have expired, paving the way to more competition. The FDA has also decided to allow biosimilar versions of insulin onto the market. These are substances that act in a similar way to existing forms, but are not necessarily identical. ""But there's concern that the cost savings [with biosimilar insulin] will be nowhere near as robust as they have been with [other types of] generic drugs,"" Greene says. ""Rather than reducing costs by 80 percent, as many generics have done, they might reduce costs by 40 percent,"" Riggs says. Greene says the point of their recent study about insulin costs isn't to simply blame the drug industry. ""We do not believe that there is a conspiracy to keep insulin expensive,"" he says. Rather, he says, incremental improvements in the drug — and the disappearance of older versions, which aren't as profitable — are more likely explanations. Greene says innovations in insulin over the past 90 years have been significant. But, he says, it's important to ask this question: ""Do these innovations merit the loss of affordable insulin?"" For patients at his clinic who can't afford insulin, Greene says, the answer is clear. A more affordable version is needed.",https://t.co/geQcIfUlWa,news

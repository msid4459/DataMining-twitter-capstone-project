Short‐term feeding of a ketogenic diet induces more severe hepatic insulin resistance than an obesogenic high‐fat diet,"Introduction Despite being one of the pressing healthcare challenges of our time, the aetiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is still incompletely understood. Although the proximate cause of T2D is the failure of the pancreatic islet to increase or maintain insulin production, the ultimate cause has not yet been conclusively identified. Overall, there is a link between an unhealthy Western diet and a lack of physical activity, and the development of T2D (van Dam et al. 2002). In terms of the progression of the disease, T2D manifests as a slow and worsening decrease of insulin sensitivity affecting multiple organs, during which time blood glucose levels are maintained within normal levels, whereas insulin levels rise to compensate, followed by the eventual failure of the pancreatic islet. Several groups report impairment of systemic glucose tolerance, as well as insulin signalling, in the brain or liver after only a very few days of feeding an obesogenic high‐fat diet (HFD) to rodents, with the diet typically consisting of 60% of calories from fat and ∼20% each from protein and carbohydrates (Wang et al. 2001; Ono et al. 2008; Clegg et al. 2011; Wiedemann et al. 2013). These early impairments of glucose homeostasis typically present as a failure of elevated glucose or insulin levels to supress hepatic glucose output, leading to decreased glucose tolerance. The development of profound insulin resistance in the major metabolic organs muscle and adipose tissue takes longer and has been linked to inflammation (Rask‐Madsen &amp; Kahn, 2012). By contrast, the manifestation of systemic glucose intolerance, as a consequence of starvation or the ingestion of very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diets (KD) for several days, has been recognized for at least a century in animals and humans and is termed starvation diabetes (Peters, 1945; Lundbaek, 1948). Starvation diabetes was shown to be linked to an increase in hepatic gluconeogenesis by tracer studies in humans (Fery et al. 1990), yet any mention of the term starvation diabetes or the citation of related studies is absent from the recent literature concerning the effects of longer‐term KD feeding on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Even though the efficacy of chronic KD feeding with respect to causing weight loss is accepted (Rosenheck et al. 2005; Nordmann et al. 2006; Hession et al. 2009; Santos et al. 2012; Paoli et al. 2013), there is significant controversy about its effect on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Kennedy et al. (2007) showed that KD improved glucose tolerance and insulin signalling in mice compared to mice maintained on a HFD for 12 weeks. Badman et al. (2009) showed that KD increases glucose sensitivity in ob/ob mice independently of weight loss. On the other hand, Jornayvaz et al. (2010) showed that, in C57BL/6 mice, 5 weeks on a KD induced hepatic insulin resistance, decreased glucose tolerance, and increased gluconeogenesis, despite preventing weight gain and increasing energy expenditure. Furthermore, Garbow et al. (2011) found increased hepatic steatosis and inflammation, as well as decreased glucose tolerance, despite high muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, in mice on a KD for 12 weeks. Given the similar reported effects on hepatic gluconeogenesis in starvation diabetes and mice maintained KD for several weeks, as well as reported metabolic abnormalities of mice fed an obesogenic HFD for several days, we aimed to address the controversy surrounding KD feeding by analysing the effects of short‐term feeding on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and comparing it with obesogenic HFD. Methods Ethical approval All mouse experiments described in the present study were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Animal Welfare Ordinance (TSchV 455.1) of the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office. The study was approved by the Zurich Cantonal Veterinary Office, Switzerland. Animals were administered buprenorphin (Temgesic; 50–100 μg kg–1) for analgesia prior to surgery and were anaesthetized during surgery with isoflurane (4–5% for induction, 1.5–2.5% for maintenance). Post‐surgery animals were injected with glucosaline (glucose in physiological 0.9% saline) (300 μL) and 5 mg kg–1 carprofen daily. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation or CO2 asphyxiation in slowly rising levels of CO2. The investigators understand the ethical principles under which The Journal of Physiology operates and confirm that their work complies with the animal ethics checklist outlined in Grundy (2015). Animals C57BL/6 mice were housed in a pathogen‐free animal facility under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights off 07.00 h) at an ambient temperature of 23°C with free access to food and water. Mice were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA) at ∼6–8 weeks old and housed in the animal facility until beginning of the experiment at 12 weeks of age. Mice were fed standard chow (purified diet #2222; Kliba‐Nafag, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland; 18% protein, 7% fat, 58% carbohydrate by mass), a ketogenic diet with 90% of calories derived from fat (Teklan TD.96355; Envigo, Huntingdon, UK; 15.3% protein, 67.4% fat, 0.6% carbohydrate by mass), or a 60% calories high‐fat diet (purified diet #2127; Kliba‐Nafag; 23.9% protein, 35% fat, 23.2% carbohydrate by mass). For the present study 149 mice were killed. Plasma collection Blood was collected from the tail vein into tubes containing 0.5 m EDTA and centrifuged to derive plasma. For post mortem blood collection, animals were killed by CO2 asphyxiation and blood was taken by heart puncture. Plasma analysis Blood glucose was measured using an Aviva Accu‐Chek glucose strip system (#07400918016, #06453988016; Roche Diagnostics International, Basel, Switzerland), taking ∼0.6 μL of blood per measurement. Insulin was measured using an MSD enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay kit (K152BZC; Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD, USA). Free fatty acids were measured using the Wako Nefa kit #9196 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan), triglycerides (TG) were measured with the Cobas Roche/Hitachi Kit #11489232 (Roche Diagnostics International) and cholesterol was measured using the Cobas Roche/Hitachi Kit #11877771 (Roche Diagnostics International). Total ketone bodies were determined using the Wako Chemicals Kit #415‐73301/411‐73401 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Glucose/insulin tolerance test Animals were fasted at 08.00 h in the morning and injected i.p. with 1.5 g kg–1 body weight of glucose [glucose tolerance test (GTT)] or 0.5 U kg–1 body weight of insulin [insulin tolerance test (ITT)] in 0.9% saline after a 6 h fast. Blood samples were obtained from tail tip bleedings for blood glucose measurements at before injection and at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection. Glucose clamp studies Hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp studies were performed in freely moving mice as described previously (Wueest et al. 2010). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and given analgesia (buprenorphine, 0.1 mg kg–1) and eye ointment was applied to both eyes (vitamin A; Bausch &amp; Lomb Swiss AG, Switzerland). A polyurethane catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein and exteriorized at the neck. Post‐surgery, mice were given daily analgesia with carprofen (nororcarp, 5 mg kg–1) for 3 days. Five to 7 days after the surgery, glucose clamp was performed in mice that had lost less than 10% of their pre‐operative weight. Mice were fasted at 08.00 h in the morning. Basal glucose production was measured after 4 h 30 min for 80 min. For the clamp, insulin was infused at a constant rate (18 and 12 mU kg–1 min–1) and steady‐state glucose infusion rate was calculated once glucose infusion reached a more or less constant rate for 15–20 min with blood glucose levels at 4–5 mm (and 6–7 mm, respectively). Glucose concentration was determined using Aviva Accu‐Chek strips every 5 min by sampling blood from a small incision in the tail tip. The glucose disposal rate was calculated by dividing the rate of [3‐3H] glucose infusion by the plasma [3‐3H] glucose specific activity at steady‐state. Endogenous glucose production during the clamp was calculated by subtracting the glucose infusion rate from the glucose disposal rate. To assess tissue‐specific glucose uptake, a bolus (10 μCi) of 2‐[1‐14C]deoxyglucose was administered via catheter at the end of the steady‐state period. Blood was sampled 2, 15, 25 and 35 min after bolus delivery. The area under the curve of disappearing plasma 2‐[1‐14C] deoxyglucose was used together with tissue concentration of phosphorylated 2‐[1‐14C] deoxyglucose to calculate glucose uptake as described previously (Chin et al. 2015). Statistical analysis All data are reported as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Correlation was analysed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Differences between groups were analysed by ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test. P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Short‐term obesogenic HFD feeding but not KD causes an increase in fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment‐insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) First, we assessed metabolic parameters in unchallenged mice after a 6 h fast, comparing mice fed a standard chow diet with mice fed a 60% HFD, or a low carbohydrate KD for 3 days. We found that, after 3 days of KD feeding, plasma glucose was slightly reduced compared to chow or HFD (Fig. 1A), whereas plasma insulin levels (Fig. 1B) were not significantly different after a 6 h fast, although they were elevated in HFD fed mice compared to KD. The use of these parameters to calculate the HOMA‐IR metric to quantify insulin resistance suggests that KD fed mice are slightly more insulin sensitive than chow fed mice after 3 days, whereas HFD fed mice show slightly impaired insulin signalling according to HOMA‐IR compared to KD mice (Fig. 1C). Because HOMA‐IR is based only on a correlation between fasted glucose and insulin levels, it does not necessarily reflect actual glucose tolerance. Because fasting plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels have been reported to correlate strongly with insulin resistance, we measured FFA after a 6 h fast. We found a slight but not significant increase in plasma FFA in the fasted state for KD vs. chow. Furthermore, we found no difference in TG (Fig. 1E) or cholesterol (Fig. 1F) between chow and KD fed animals after a 6 h fast, and only small differences between HFD and chow fed animals. As expected from the diet, total plasma ketones were significantly increased in the animals on KD compared to chow and HFD fed animals (Fig. 1G). After 3 days of the respective diets, no significant difference in body weight gain was yet apparent (Fig. 1H), despite an increased caloric intake on HFD and KD, which both show an increased caloric density compared to chow (Fig. 1I). These data indicate that, in the basal state, 3 days of a KD appears to have a neutral to beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity, suggesting a healthy, glucose tolerant state.

Short‐term KD or HFD feeding causes impaired glucose clearance and insulin tolerance To assess glucose sensitivity, we next challenged animals with an i.p. GTT after 3 days of a HFD or KD diet (Fig. 2A and B). Unlike our findings in the basal fasted state, we found a marked and significant decrease in glucose clearance of both HFD and KD fed animals compared to chow fed animals. We also performed an i.p. ITT after 3 days of diet (Fig. 2C). The response in the ITT showed a similar impairment as in the GTT (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that, despite an apparently improved insulin sensitivity in the fasted state, 3 days of KD feeding is sufficient to cause impaired glucose homeostasis in C57/Bl6 mice, comparable to the known adverse short‐term effects of a HFD feeding regime.

Steady‐state RER inversely correlates with glucose tolerance, although all groups respond to an i.p. glucose challenge with an increase in RER The feeding of a KD for 3 days is metabolically similar to the interventions leading to the observed effect of starvation diabetes, and the suggestion has been made that a decreased ability to oxidize glucose, resulting from metabolic adaptation to lipids, might be at least partly responsible for the effect (Anderson &amp; Herman, 1972). Therefore, we aimed to measure systemic substrate usage by measuring and by indirect calorimetry. We found no differences between the three groups in consumed normalized to lean body mass (Fig. 3A and C), suggesting that reported differences in energy expenditure between these different feeding regimens (Jornayvaz et al. 2010; Hatori et al. 2012) only occur after longer periods of feeding. We did find differences in , as might be expected by shifting substrate usage for oxidative phosphorylation from carbohydrates to fat (Fig. 3B and C). These changes in caused marked differences in the RER. Measuring the RER during the diet switch showed that, after ∼16 h, the animals arrived at their respective steady‐state RERs, with the KD fed animals reaching an RER of ∼0.7, indicating almost complete reliance on lipids as a fuel, whereas the HFD fed group reached an RER of ∼0.8 and the RER of the chow fed group remained close to 1.0 (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, these steady‐state RERs correlated very well with the observed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the GTT and ITT, respectively (Fig. 2). We obtained a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = –0.9991, R2 = 0.9995 and P = 0.0146 for RER vs. AUCGTT and a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = –0.9981, R2 = 0.9961 and P = 0.039 for RER vs. AUCITT. One possible explanation occasionally evoked to explain the effects of starvation diabetes is that the metabolic shift to lipids causes impairments in the ability to metabolize or take up glucose and our observation concerning the correlations of RER with glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity appears to support such a hypothesis. To test this, we performed a GTT on animals during continuous indirect calorimetry measurements. We found that all groups immediately reacted to the i.p. injection of glucose after a 6 h fast with a brief but marked increase in RER (Fig. 3D and E). This suggests that the ability and propensity to metabolize glucose is unaltered, despite a marked metabolic shift in the primary oxidation fuel caused by adaptation to the various diets, and that the observed changes in glucose homeostasis are not directly a result of the change in the primary metabolic substrate.

Hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamps reveal differences in insulin‐suppressed endogenous glucose production but not glucose disposal or tissue glucose uptake To assess whole body and tissue‐specific insulin sensitivity in mice fed the three different diets, hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamps were performed. We used [3‐3H] labelled glucose to estimate basal and insulin‐suppressed endogenous glucose production (EGP; mainly reflecting hepatic glucose production) and a bolus of 2‐[1‐14C] labelled deoxyglucose was given after reaching steady‐state glucose infusion to measure tissue‐specific glucose uptake. We infused 18 mU kg–1 min–1 insulin and clamped the mice at a plasma glucose level of 5 mm (Fig. 4A). The glucose infusion rate necessary to achieve euglycemia (Fig. 4B) was significantly lower in mice after 3 days of KD feeding compared to chow fed mice, whereas values for the HFD‐fed mice were between those for KD and chow (Fig. 4C and D). This situation is somewhat similar to that observed during the IPGTT (Fig. 2A), where the temporal dynamics showed a slightly better glucose clearance of HFD animals compared to KD, whereas both groups were clearly impaired in glucose tolerance compared to chow. Although basal EGP was similar between the groups, the ability of insulin to supress EGP was significantly reduced in KD compared to chow‐fed mice (Fig. 4E). Conversely, neither the rates of systemic glucose disappearance (Fig. 4F), nor glucose uptake into white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle (Fig. 4G) were changed. These data indicate that reduced insulin sensitivity observed in KD fed mice is mainly mediated by blunted hepatic insulin sensitivity. A, scheme of glucose clamp procedure.

Data are plotted as the mean ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01 by ANOVA. Hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamps with lower insulin and glucose targets confirm effect of reduced insulin‐suppressed endogenous glucose production To further confirm these findings, we repeated the hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp studies with lower infusion rates of insulin (12 mU kg–1 min–1) and higher plasma glucose targets (6–7 mm), using [3‐3H] labelled glucose to estimate basal and insulin‐suppressed endogenous glucose production and a bolus of 2‐[1‐14C] at steady‐state to measure tissue glucose uptake (Fig. 5A). In this setting, HFD and KD fed animals needed significantly lower rates of glucose infusion to achieve plasma levels in the target range (Fig. 5B–D). Again, we did not observe a difference in basal EGP, although there was a significantly increased EGP of KD animals in the insulin suppressed state (Fig. 5E). Similar to the clamps with higher insulin infusion and lower glucose targets, there was no significant difference in the systemic rate of glucose disappearance (Fig. 5F) or WAT and muscle glucose uptake (Fig. 5E). These data confirm our finding that the reduced insulin sensitivity observed in KD fed mice is mainly mediated by blunted hepatic insulin sensitivity affecting glucose output, across different ranges of insulin infusion and target plasma glucose levels.

Discussion Given the controversy regarding the link between KD and insulin sensitivity, we analysed glucose tolerance in response to short‐term dietary challenges of KD and HFD vs. a chow diet. The results of the present study demonstrate that, in the context of ad libitum feeding of both HFD or KD for a short period, the effect on systemic glucose tolerance is a result of the inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output, whereas muscle and adipose tissue glucose uptake are completely unperturbed. In our initial hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp study, we chose rather high insulin levels during the clamp (18 mU kg–1 min–1), leading to a complete suppression of hepatic glucose output under insulin and even negative values for EGP in some cases. We aimed to address this by repeating the clamp studies with lower insulin levels (12 mU kg–1 min–1) and higher glucose targets. Although we were able to confirm our initial findings, it should be noted that our insulin levels still are high and lead to almost complete suppression of HGP. In longer‐term studies, 5 weeks of KD feeding resulted in a similar phenotype to the one observed by us after 3 days (Jornayvaz et al. 2010), whereas other studies report universally beneficial effects on glucose metabolism resulting from KD feeding (Kennedy et al. 2007; Badman et al. 2009). Two recent studies looking at KD feeding in rodents for a time span of years complicate the picture. Roberts et al. (2017) report drastically impaired systemic glucose clearance, consistent with the findings of the present study and those of Jornayvaz et al. (2010), yet improved insulin sensitivity in aged mice on a live‐long KD, whereas Newman et al. (2017) do not report any functional data on glucose homeostasis. Our own studies and those of Jornayvaz et al. (2010) were performed in young mice, and so a plausible interpretation of these data is that impaired glucose tolerance is a direct metabolic effect of KD feeding, whereas life‐long low levels of glucose and insulin might counter the age‐dependent insulin resistance, which appears to involve a different mechanism than diet‐induced insulin resistance (Bapat et al. 2015). Persistent low glucose and insulin plasma levels leading to a shift of lipid oxidation as the main fuel, as well as ketogenesis to preserve glucose, are key features that are shared by KD feeding and starvation. This is pertinent in light of the literature on starvation diabetes (Peters, 1945; Lundbaek, 1948), which suggests that 1–3 days of starvation or carbohydrate depletion is sufficient to impair systemic glucose clearance. It is possible that 3 days of carbohydrate depletion is sufficient to achieve the metabolic adaptation to KD and that the effects observed after longer duration reported by Jornayvaz et al. (2010) are not a result of impairments caused by long‐term KD but, instead, reflect the normal physiological adaptation to low carbohydrate intake. In the context of obesogenic HFD (typically containing ∼60% of calories from fat and 20% from carbohydrates), the impaired ability of insulin to reduce EGP after a few days of HFD feeding has been repeatedly observed in mice and men (Song et al. 2001; Brøns et al. 2009; Wiedemann et al. 2013). Moreover, elevated EGP is also known to be a key contributor of the elevated glucose levels occurring in T2D (Hundal et al. 2000). Our finding that, in both short‐term KD and HFD feeding, tissue glucose uptake is normal, is also in line with a recent report analysing the effect of obesogenic 60% HFD‐feeding for different time‐spans (Turner et al. 2013), which demonstrated that three days of HFD feeding caused insulin resistance specifically at the level of the liver. By contrast, impairments of muscle glucose uptake were only observed after 3 weeks and longer of HFD feeding. On the other hand, it has long been reported that low insulin levels themselves can cause peripheral insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes. However, this insulin resistance affects primarily the muscle (and not the liver), suggesting that this effect is unrelated to the causes of insulin resistance stemming from short‐term high‐fat diet consumption (DeFronzo et al. 1982a, b). It is clear that, although there are important metabolic similarities between KD feeding and starvation, there are also substantial differences. Both starvation and dietary carbohydrate depletion lead to a switch of primary fuel from carbohydrate to lipid, as well as ketogenesis. However, starvation causes a pronounced reduction in energy expenditure and heat production (Cahill et al. 1966; Cahill, 1970; Jensen et al. 2013), whereas KD provides ample energy and reportedly causes either increased or unchanged energy expenditure (Jornayvaz et al. 2010; Paoli et al. 2013; Hall et al. 2016). The consequences of starvation resulting from reduced energy intake, rather than reduced carbohydrate intake, include increased autophagy and a reduced metabolic rate. Thus, it is possible that the symptoms of short‐term KD feeding in the present study, and the reported symptoms of starvation diabetes are caused by different mechanisms. The significant correlation of RER and impaired glucose homeostasis suggests otherwise. In terms of the primary fuel for oxidation, our data show that animals on a regular chow diet primarily oxidize carbohydrates, whereas animals on a KD oxidize almost exclusively lipids and their RER does not move at all during fasting, with the HFD fed animals lying in between, oxidizing somewhat more lipids than carbohydrates. Remarkably, this fuel preference predicts the impairment to glucose homeostasis assessed by all three methods (GTT, ITT and glucose clamp). The severity of the impairment correlates linearly with the degree of lipid oxidation, with KD fed animals being most impaired and HFD fed animals lying in between. Importantly, the RER measurements during GTT and the glucose clamp studies reveal that the impairment does not occur at the level of the rate of glucose disappearance from plasma, tissue glucose uptake or the ability to oxidize glucose. In the fasted or carbohydrate‐depleted state, which is typically when rates of FFA oxidation are high in healthy individuals, increased hepatic glucose output is a vital necessity. Because the depletion of liver and muscle glycogen stores requires replenishment, it is plausible to propose that substantially elevated rates of FFA oxidation persisting for durations longer than 18–24 h is interpreted by part of the physiological homeostat as a signal for glucose depletion. This signal might result in a deliberate modulation of the ability of insulin to block endogenous glucose output to replenish muscle glycogen stores after periods of glucose paucity. Such a signal probably acts via the CNS, as reported previously (Girard, 2006), and is entirely consistent with the observed phenotype of starvation diabetes, which should more accurately be termed glucose depletion‐dependent impaired glucose tolerance. Although animals on a HFD for 3 days are by no means diabetic, long‐term HFD feeding is the quintessential animal model for diet‐induced insulin resistance leading to T2D, and it is clear that, also in humans, the impact of an obesogenic diet occurs very long before overt T2D (Nathan, 2002; Boden et al. 2015). However, these initial causes and triggers are still incompletely understood. In terms of the long‐term progression of the disease, inflammation has been prominently invoked in the discussion of insulin resistance in the context of T2D. Dating back to a seminal study by Hotamisligil et al. (1993), a large body of evidence has convincingly demonstrated a causal link between inflammatory processes and peripheral insulin resistance, in particular in muscle and adipose tissue (Gregor &amp; Hotamisligil, 2011). The current frontrunner for the first injury following a switch to obesogenic HFD is acute activation and inflammation of astrocytes and microglia, particularly in the ventromedial hypothalamus (Horvath et al. 2010; Thaler et al. 2011). However, a recent study in which inflammatory activation of microglia was blocked in the CNS demonstrated alterations in energy expenditure and intake, although no changes in glucose homeostasis were observed (Valdearcos et al. 2017). Moreover, a recent study analysing injury in the CNS resulting from the consumption of high‐fat, low carbohydrate or high‐fat, high carbohydrate diets only found damage following the high‐fat, high carbohydrate diets (Gao et al. 2017). Furthermore, a study examining the effects of inflammation on HFD induced insulin resistance over time reported a biphasic effect; short‐term effects were independent of inflammation, whereas long‐term effects responded well to various anti‐inflammatory interventions (Lee et al. 2011). These data lend credence to the interpretation that the early increase in hepatic glucose production following a HFD challenge is not caused by injury but, instead, represents a physiological response to drastically elevated fat intake and a shift in metabolic fuel preference. Interestingly, in our studies, only the HFD animals showed signs of impaired glucose homeostasis when observed in the 6 h fasted state, even though the effect on hepatic glucose output under insulin was stronger in the KD fed group. The key difference between these two diets is that the obesogenic HFD provides significant amounts of calories from both fat and carbohydrate, whereas the non‐obesogenic KD provides calories almost exclusively from fat. It is relevant to note that a low carbohydrate KD does not cause obesity and that muscle insulin sensitivity appears to be entirely preserved in this model even after long periods of feeding, in marked contrast to obesogenic HFD (Jornayvaz et al. 2010; Garbow et al. 2011). These observations are readily explained assuming that persistently elevated lipid oxidation causes a signal to be transmitted to indicate glucose paucity and that the fat oxidation‐dependent blunting of the ability of insulin to suppress EGP is probably not linked to any damage and is reversible. This is a necessary adaptation in animals on a KD. However, in animals consuming large amounts of fat together with significant amounts of carbohydrate (a hallmark of the so‐called Western diet), the increased flux of glucose from endogenous production combines with the dietary glucose, leading to a progressive deterioration of systemic insulin sensitivity caused by the elevated insulin levels released from the pancreas to cope with elevated postprandial and fasting glucose levels.

In such case although the production of insulin is enough in amount but the cells in our body becomes resistant to insulin and stops the entry of insulin into the cell. Being overweight stresses the insides of individual cells. Specifically, too much of eating stresses the membranous network inside cells known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER). once the ER has a lot more nutrients to process than it can handle, it sends out alarm signal telling the cell to dampen down the hypoglycemic agent receptors on the cell surface. This interprets to hypoglycemic agent resistance and to persistently high concentrations of the sugar aldohexose within the blood. This is one of the confirming signs of diabetes.Diabetes and EndocrinologyThe human body secretes hormones to maintain the chemical balance in the body in order to run our body smoothly. These hormones are released in our body by some glands that are considered to be the part of the endocrine system. The major endocrine organs present in our body include pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenalin gland, ovaries, testes and pancreas.In diabetes patients the main problem that incurs due to the endocrine system is the hormone imbalance. This is because of the lack or excessive secretion of the hormone from their respective gland. But diabetes is majorly a pancreatic disorder that is incurred due to irregular release of Insulinvar Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();(function(){var s1=document.createElement(""script""),s0=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];s1.async=true;s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5cbdc118d6e05b735b43b268/default';s1.charset='UTF-8';s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);})();var Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();(function(){var s1=document.createElement(""script""),s0=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];s1.async=true;s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5c3f11e351410568a106e0f6/default';s1.charset='UTF-8';s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);})();Endocrinology and MetabolismEndocrinology is the study of the endocrine system in the body. This is a system of glands which secrete hormones .Humans have over 50 different hormones. They exist in small amounts and still have a significant impact on bodily function and development. Hormones regulate metabolism, respiration, growth, reproduction, sensory perception and movement. Hormone imbalances are the underlying reason for a wide range of medical conditions. Endocrinology focuses on both the hormones and the glands and tissues that produce them.Diabetes and Metabolic DisordersThe metabolism of people with diabetes is almost identical to the metabolism of people without diabetes. The only difference is the volume or effectiveness of the insulin produced by the body. In type 2 diabetes, the effectiveness of insulin is reduced and in type 1 diabetes, insulin levels in the body are very low but the proper functioning of metabolism is reliant on the delivery of insulin. This can be done with introduction of external insulin to the body with the help of injection or pump.Pancreatitis and InsulinThe pancreas is academic degree organ placed behind the lower a vicinity of the abdomen, above the spine and plays a really a vital role in diabetes. The pancreas is that the organ that produces the insulin, one the foremost hormones that helps to manage hexose or the blood sugar glucose levels by aiding the transport of aldohexose from the blood into neighboring cells. The cells that manufacture the insulin are known as beta cells. Endocrine Glands and HormonesEndocrine disorders can be classified according to the intensity of hormonal activity and according to the origin of endocrine disorder. From the intensity of hormonal activity of endocrine gland we can distinguish hyper function of endocrine gland, which is characterized by increased secretion of its hormone as well as by increased concentration of this hormone in circulating blood.Clinical Researches in Diabetes (Trials and Case studies)Clinical researches / clinical trials are approaches to precisely test medication or gadget in patients before it is endorsed by the FDA to be utilized in public. Clinical trials are an important and critical step in our having the capacity to have new medications for diabetes and other varied conditions. A case study is a methodology and a strategy that investigates a phenomenon with its real-life context. Case studies and clinical trials are used to develop or assess the quality of the medications being developed.Cardiovascular issues in DiabetesCardiovascular diseases affects the circulation of blood and poor circulation leads to complications. Diabetes increases the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Reports states, most of the people with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes are having high blood pressure. These complications embrace coronary cardiopathy (CHD), stroke, peripheral blood vessel malady, renal disorder, retinopathy, and probably pathology. Attributable to the aging of the population and an increasing prevalence of obesity and inactive life habits within the prevalence of diabetes is increasing. 68% of people age 65 or older with diabetes die from some of the heart diseases and 16% die of stroke. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than adults without diabetes.Nanotechnology in Diabetes TreatmentNanotechnology holds a great deal of promise for the world of medicine. It is likely that some of the first truly revolutionary changes noticeable in our everyday lives will be brought about by Nano-medicine. the possibilities of Nano-medicine include Nano formulations for efficient drug delivery, smart drugs which only activate when needed, engineered microbes which produce human hormones.Diabetic Nephropathy and UrineDiabetic nephropathy (DN), also known as diabetic kidney disease, is the chronic loss of kidney function occurring in those with diabetes mellitus. Protein loss in the urine due to damage to the glomeruli may become massive, and cause a low serum albumin with resulting generalized body swelling (edema) and result in the nephrotic syndrome. Likewise, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may progressively fall from a normal of over 90 ml/min/1.73m2 to less than 15, at which point the patient is said to have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It usually is slowly progressive over years.Bariatric SurgeryBariatric surgical procedures cause weight loss by restricting the amount of food the stomach can hold, causing malabsorption of nutrients, or by a combination of both gastric restriction and malabsorption. Bariatric procedures also often cause hormonal changes. Most weight loss surgeries today are performed using minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic surgery). The basic principle of bariatric surgery is to restrict food intake and decrease the absorption of food in the stomach and intestines.Pediatric Diabetes and EndocrinologyPediatric or juvenile diabetes is chronic type 1 diabetes which affects the young population, particularly children under the age of 15. Such diabetes brings about lifetime dependency on exogenous insulin. Signs and symptoms of pediatric diabetes are like other types of diabetes and children are more likely to develop the disease if there is a family history of diabetes. Complications of pediatric diabetes also generally include heart diseases, nerve damage, nerve, kidney and eye damage, skin conditions, osteoporosis, etc. Proper diagnosis, treatment and management are the possible remedies for this type of diabetes.Pediatric Endocrinology is a subspecialty of pediatrics dealing with metabolic and endocrine disorders in children. The most common disease of the speciality is type 1 diabetes , which usually accounts for at least 50% of a typical clinical practice. The next most common problem is growth disorders , especially those amenable to growth hormone treatment. Pediatric endocrinologists are usually the primary physicians involved in the medical care of infants and children with intersex disorders. It also deals with hypoglycaemia and other forms of hyperglycemia in childhood, variations of puberty as well other adrenal, thyroid and pituitary problems.Physiotherapy in diabetesDiabetes became a serious and deadly disease mainly because of obesity and poor lifestyle. Although diabetes can be prevented, treated, controlled, and the risk lessened via various health and lifestyle interventions like physiotherapy. Physiotherapy can be used wisely to diagnosis, treat, and manage musculoskeletal (MSK) manifestations and complications of type 2 diabetes. Physiotherapy mehods like effective exercise, physical conditioning, and active, healthy living can be effective in treating diabetes Stem Cell Therapy in DiabetesIn most cases of stem cell therapy, using one's own stem cells is more more helpful for the exocrine gland to regenerate and boost its ability to produce insulin. Procedure continues to achieve success, with patients experiencing health advantages even six months after stem cell diabetes treatment. Repeated applications of adipose stem cells is one of the most effective treatment for type two diabetes, providing an open window to create dietary changes, supplementation and exercise much more effective for long-term management of blood glucose. Diabetic RetinopathyDiabetic retinopathy is a condition or disease of eye that is found in patients with Diabetes. This can be once high blood glucose levels cause injury to blood vessels within the membrane. These blood vessels will swell and leak. Or they'll shut, stopping blood from passing through. generally abnormal new blood vessels grow on the membrane. All of those changes will steal your vision.Cardiovascular risks in obeseObesity not only increases the cardiovascular risks but it damages more than just the heart and blood system. It is also the major cause of bile stones, osteoarthritis and respiratory problems. Obesity closely interferes with many health conditions that underlie cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, diabetes and abnormal blood cholesterol. Additionally, weight gain is a frequent consequence of a heart-damaging lifestyle such as lack of exercise and a fat diet. Obesity can also lead to Cardiac arrest. This is a serious condition when the heart is unable to pump enough amount of blood to satisfy the body's requirement. Obesity and Metabolic syndromeObesity is dirctly or indirctly linked to some endocrine diseases, including basic ones such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovarian syndrome to rare ones such as Cushing's syndrome, central hypothyroidism, and hypothalamic disorders. Mechanisms to upgrade weight shift in as per endocrine condition. Hypothyroidism is related to the combination of hyaluronic acid in different tissues, extra liquid preservation due to reduced cardiovascular yield and reduced thermogenesis. The net abundance of androgen gives the impression of being urgent in the progression of central obesity. In Cushing's syndrome, association with thyroid and developmental hormones plays a significant part in increasing adipocyte separation and adipogenesis. This audit also depicts remaining rare cases: hypothalamic obesity due to central hypothyroidism and combined hormone deficiencies.Diabetes and cancerDiabetes and cancer are two of the biggest threats with tremendous impact to humans during this decade. However scientists are yet to prove a relation between the two. Recent studies show some evidences however not definite proofs that some diabetes treatment methods increases the danger of cancer. Instances from the recent studies includes anti-diabetics, the foremost usually used anti-diabetic drug, appears to lower cancer risk. however there is conjointly proof from some studies conducted by others that hypoglycemic agent, notably long hypoglycemic agent glargine (Lantus), could increase cancer risk. Diabetes in young adultsResearches states that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are on the rise among young adults. Current estimates suggest that up to 3 million youth and adults in the United States are living with type 1 diabetes . A report on Diabetes in Youth found that newly diagnosed cases of Type 2 diabetes in children and teens increased by about 4.8 percent in each year of the study's period between 2002 and 2012. Gestational Diabetes The short term occurrence of diabetes in pregnant ladies is majorly known as Gestational diabetes. It is seen in non- diabetic mothers suddenly develops diabetes during pregnancy and the symptoms disappears after the baby's birth.Diabetic NeuropathyThe damage caused to nerves by diabetes is called Diabetic neuropathy. The main cause of this damage is the pressure generated due to high blood glucose levels in the blood for a very long time and high levels of fats, such as triglycerides in the blood. Symptoms vary with the type of diabetic neuropathy.Mainly diabetic neuropathy is divided into 4 types namely;Peripheral neuropathyAutonomic neuropathyRadiculoplexus neuropathyMononeuropathyDiabetes and DementiaDementia being called the disorder due to a result of trauma or brain illness can be connected to diabetes mellitus as mentioned in some of the studies. Although not much is known about the connection between dementia and diabetes mellitus. Dementia is the term used to specify the mind disease where the capacity recall and to think diminish along. These brain diseases affect capacity and a person's rituals to execute. The changes is unnoticeable and small, but becomes severe. The case arises when diseases like strokes or Alzheimers impact the mind. Even though Alzheimers has been counted as the most important reason behind dementia, other potential cases to remain.Diabetes Wound CareWound healing gets slow in diabetic patients due to a number of factors such as High blood sugar levels (When your blood sugar level is higher than normal, it prevents nutrients and oxygen from energizing cells which prevents your immune system from functioning efficiently and eventually increases inflammation in the body's cells. Diabetes ManagementAlong with prevention and treatment, management is very important and plays a crucial role in diabetes. . Management of diabetes mainly aims to minimize the risk of long-term consequences associated with diabetes. It not only involves keeping a check on blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels but also focusing on modern approaches like exercise, dietary and lifestyle management often coupled with on-going blood glucose level monitoring. Besides this, self-management of diabetes is also very crucial for the proper adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications.Diabetes and Mental HealthUntreated mental state problems can make diabetes worse, and issues with diabetes will build mental state problems worse. however if one starts recovering, the other will start recovering too. The main set of mental health problems in Diabetes includes-Latest Techniques In Diabetes DiagnosisThe concept of 'new technologies' for type 1 diabetes and new discovery and advanced type 2 diabetes treatment has expanded in recent years at a rate that some might consider comparable to 'Moore's Law', and the sheer number of new technologies entering into the type 1 diabetes marketplace is also growing at a remarkable rate. From the patient's perspective, this is not only exciting but can lead to a sense of optimism. Technologies that today are growing commonplace. come under new therapeutic mechanisms of diabetes. Indeed, it could be argued that the major advances in type 1 diabetes care made within the last quarter of a century have come from technology rather than biology. Previous Conference ReportEuroscicon conference ""3rd World Congress on Diabetes and Obesity"" formally Diabetes Conference 2019 was held in Holiday inn Rome Aurelia | Rome, Italy during 18-19 March, 2019 with active participation of professional researchers, scientists involved in the development of high-quality education &amp; research in all aspects.Diabetes Conference 2019 witnessed an amalgamation of peerless speakers who enlightened the crowd with their knowledge and confabulated on various topics related to the field of Diabetes and Obesity.

We take immense pleasure to get the opportunity to host the next edition of our congress in during November 06-07, 2019 in Chicago, USA. This time we have planned to organize a better and bigger congress that will include various aspects of researches that left unfocussed in our last edition.Let us meet again @chicago Market ResearchAs per the studies conducted recently, there are more than twenty-seven million diabetes patients within the U.S.A., thus world's third largest country in terms of diabetes patients in 2018. The major reasons behind these prevailing cases of diabetes is the rise of obesity levels associated with the increasing aging population. It's been found in the studies conducted that over half the U.S.A. population is either obese or overweight that is especially because of their inactive lifestyles, physical inactivities and unhealthy consumption habits. Moreover, the aging population within the U.S.A. has been on the increase since the 1960's. individuals aged sixty five years and on top of accounted for around 11th of September of the overall population in 1960 whereas in 2018, this cohort accounted for around 15 August 1945 of the whole U.S.A. population. Driven by rising incidences of polygenic disorder and therefore the incontrovertible fact that the U.S.A. has one amongst the very best per capita tending expenditures, the U.S.A. marketplace for polygenic disorder medication has grownup at a CAGR of around eleven.8% throughout 2011-2018, reaching a price of US$ forty five.4 Billion in 2018.Diabetes has increasingly become a lifestyle related disease as it afflicts young and old. As the number of patients grow across the globe, there has never been a stronger and more urgent need for novel therapeutic measures in clinical and preclinical evaluation, that arrest the growth of the disease. The diabetes market, consisting mainly of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is large and growing significantly. Global diabetes market is expected to grow at CAGR of 7.6% for the forecasted period of 2018-2023.the market is segmented on the basis of type of diabetes, drugs class and diabetic devices. Diabetic drugs have the highest market share amongst drugs and devices and are also expected to have the highest growth rate with a CAGR of 8.9% . some of the top selling diabetic drugs include Lantus(sanofi), Januvia(Merck and Co), Humalog(Eli Lily And Co),Novo rapid(Novo Nordisk),Levemir(Novo Nordisk),Victoza(Novo Nordisk),Janumet(Merck And Co),Novolog(Novo Nordisk),Humalin (Eli Lily And Co) and Galvus (Novartis).with the diabetic population expected to cross the 350 million market by 2030 the market is expected to show strong growth rate. Diabetic drugs are highly priced which could be one of the major drawbacks.Diabetes drug research market in Europe is expected to progress with a 5.08% CAGR over the forecast years of 2018-2026. It is the second largest market for diabetes drugs. High blood glucose kills about 3.4 million people annually worldwide. Approximately 80% of these deaths take place in underdeveloped and developing countries, and almost half are people aged less than 70 years. As per recent research in WHO diabetic deaths will double between 2005 and 2030. India had 69.2 million people living with diabetes (8.7%) in 2015. About 90% of the patients are suffering from Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Research Market is expected to grow at the average CAGR of 6.5% time period of 2016-2023. India's Diabetes Market is growing rapidly. India is expected to grow US$ 7441.6 million by 2023 from US$ 4778.7 million in 2016. The data varies from $263 billion spent in North America to $147 billion in Europe and Northern Asia. Followed by China, Mongolia, South East Asia and Oceania with a total of $88 billion. Why Chicago?As per reports, over 1,300,000 people in Illinois have diabetes or 12.8% of the population. Illinoisans are increasingly feeling the effects of diabetes. In 2018, reports states USA as third largest country worldwide in terms of diabetes patients. The increasing rate of diabetes patients are expected to grow more in coming years demands new advancements in research thus producing a bigger market for diabetes related products/procedures.Societies Associated with Diabetes Research: SBDR - Society for Biomedical Diabetes Research Austrian Diabetes Association Flemish Diabetes Association Association of Juvenile Diabetes Canadian Diabetes Association Juvenile Diabetes Foundation of Chile German Diabetes Union Diabetic Society of Singapore Japan Diabetes Society Hong Kong Diabetes Federation The International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology Royal Society of Medicine Endocrinology and Diabetes Section International Society of Psych neuroendocrinology International Neuroendocrine Federation European Society of Endocrinology Clinical Endocrinology Trust Swiss Diabetes Society Spanish Diabetes Society Korean Diabetes AssociationDiabetic Research Centers World wide:University of Michigan Albert Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes CenterBoston AreaColumbia UniversityIndiana UniversityJohns Hopkins University/University of MarylandJoslin Diabetes Center - Harvard Medical SchoolStanford UniversityUniversity of Alabama at BirminghamUCSD-UCLAUCSFUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of MichiganUniversity of PennsylvaniaUniversity of WashingtonWashington UniversityVanderbilt UniversityYale UniversityAlbert Einstein College of MedicineEmory UniversityKaiser Foundation Research InstituteUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of ColoradoInternational Diabetes Federation, UAEPublic Health Research Center, Abu Dhabi, UAEImperial College London Diabetes Centre, UAEGlobal Diabetes Research Centre, India.Diabetes Research Center, PUMCH, ChinaCenter for Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, JapanLeicester Diabetes Centre, United KingdomGarvan Institute of Medical Research, AustraliaPersatuan Diabetes Indonesia Research CentreDiabetic Hospitals Across the world:Mayo Clinic – Rochester, MNCleveland Clinic – Cleveland, OH Massachusetts General Hospital – Boston, MAJohns Hopkins Hospital – Baltimore, MDUCSF Medical Center – San Francisco, CANew York-Presbyterian University Hospital of Columbia and Cornell – New York, NYYale-New Haven Hospital – New Haven, CTNorthwestern Memorial Hospital – Chicago, ILUCLA Medical Center – Los Angeles, CAUniversity of Washington Medical Center – Seattle, WAHospitals of the University of Pennsylvania-Penn Presbyterian – Philadelphia, PABrigham and Women's Hospital – Boston, MAFlorida Hospital Orlando – Orlando, FLCedars-Sinai Medical Center – Los Angeles, CABarnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University – St. Louis, MOBeaumont Hospital – Grosse Pointe, MIMount Sinai Hospital – New York, NYFroedtert Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin – Milwaukee, WILancaster General Hospital – Lancaster, PAUniversity of Kansas Hospital – Kansas City, KSKEM Hospital, PuneLakeshore Hospital &amp; Research Center, KochiAll India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), DelhiM.V.

Additionally, weight gain is a frequent consequence of a heart-damaging lifestyle such as lack of exercise and a fat diet. Obesity can also lead to Cardiac arrest. This is a serious condition when the heart is unable to pump enough amount of blood to satisfy the body's requirement. Obesity and Metabolic syndromeObesity is dirctly or indirctly linked to some endocrine diseases, including basic ones such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovarian syndrome to rare ones such as Cushing's syndrome, central hypothyroidism, and hypothalamic disorders. Mechanisms to upgrade weight shift in as per endocrine condition. Hypothyroidism is related to the combination of hyaluronic acid in different tissues, extra liquid preservation due to reduced cardiovascular yield and reduced thermogenesis. The net abundance of androgen gives the impression of being urgent in the progression of central obesity. In Cushing's syndrome, association with thyroid and developmental hormones plays a significant part in increasing adipocyte separation and adipogenesis. This audit also depicts remaining rare cases: hypothalamic obesity due to central hypothyroidism and combined hormone deficiencies.Diabetes and cancerDiabetes and cancer are two of the biggest threats with tremendous impact to humans during this decade. However scientists are yet to prove a relation between the two. Recent studies show some evidences however not definite proofs that some diabetes treatment methods increases the danger of cancer. Instances from the recent studies includes anti-diabetics, the foremost usually used anti-diabetic drug, appears to lower cancer risk. however there is conjointly proof from some studies conducted by others that hypoglycemic agent, notably long hypoglycemic agent glargine (Lantus), could increase cancer risk. Diabetes in young adultsResearches states that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are on the rise among young adults. Current estimates suggest that up to 3 million youth and adults in the United States are living with type 1 diabetes . A report on Diabetes in Youth found that newly diagnosed cases of Type 2 diabetes in children and teens increased by about 4.8 percent in each year of the study's period between 2002 and 2012. Gestational Diabetes The short term occurrence of diabetes in pregnant ladies is majorly known as Gestational diabetes. It is seen in non- diabetic mothers suddenly develops diabetes during pregnancy and the symptoms disappears after the baby's birth.Diabetic NeuropathyThe damage caused to nerves by diabetes is called Diabetic neuropathy. The main cause of this damage is the pressure generated due to high blood glucose levels in the blood for a very long time and high levels of fats, such as triglycerides in the blood. Symptoms vary with the type of diabetic neuropathy.Mainly diabetic neuropathy is divided into 4 types namely;Peripheral neuropathyAutonomic neuropathyRadiculoplexus neuropathyMononeuropathyDiabetes and DementiaDementia being called the disorder due to a result of trauma or brain illness can be connected to diabetes mellitus as mentioned in some of the studies. Although not much is known about the connection between dementia and diabetes mellitus. Dementia is the term used to specify the mind disease where the capacity recall and to think diminish along. These brain diseases affect capacity and a person's rituals to execute. The changes is unnoticeable and small, but becomes severe. The case arises when diseases like strokes or Alzheimers impact the mind. Even though Alzheimers has been counted as the most important reason behind dementia, other potential cases to remain.Diabetes Wound CareWound healing gets slow in diabetic patients due to a number of factors such as High blood sugar levels (When your blood sugar level is higher than normal, it prevents nutrients and oxygen from energizing cells which prevents your immune system from functioning efficiently and eventually increases inflammation in the body's cells. Diabetes ManagementAlong with prevention and treatment, management is very important and plays a crucial role in diabetes. . Management of diabetes mainly aims to minimize the risk of long-term consequences associated with diabetes. It not only involves keeping a check on blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels but also focusing on modern approaches like exercise, dietary and lifestyle management often coupled with on-going blood glucose level monitoring. Besides this, self-management of diabetes is also very crucial for the proper adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications.Diabetes and Mental HealthUntreated mental state problems can make diabetes worse, and issues with diabetes will build mental state problems worse. however if one starts recovering, the other will start recovering too. The main set of mental health problems in Diabetes includes-Latest Techniques In Diabetes DiagnosisThe concept of 'new technologies' for type 1 diabetes and new discovery and advanced type 2 diabetes treatment has expanded in recent years at a rate that some might consider comparable to 'Moore's Law', and the sheer number of new technologies entering into the type 1 diabetes marketplace is also growing at a remarkable rate. From the patient's perspective, this is not only exciting but can lead to a sense of optimism. Technologies that today are growing commonplace. come under new therapeutic mechanisms of diabetes. Indeed, it could be argued that the major advances in type 1 diabetes care made within the last quarter of a century have come from technology rather than biology.

We take immense pleasure to get the opportunity to host the next edition of our congress in during November 06-07, 2019 in Chicago, USA. This time we have planned to organize a better and bigger congress that will include various aspects of researches that left unfocussed in our last edition.Let us meet again @chicago Market ResearchAs per the studies conducted recently, there are more than twenty-seven million diabetes patients within the U.S.A., thus world's third largest country in terms of diabetes patients in 2018. The major reasons behind these prevailing cases of diabetes is the rise of obesity levels associated with the increasing aging population. It's been found in the studies conducted that over half the U.S.A. population is either obese or overweight that is especially because of their inactive lifestyles, physical inactivities and unhealthy consumption habits. Moreover, the aging population within the U.S.A. has been on the increase since the 1960's. individuals aged sixty five years and on top of accounted for around 11th of September of the overall population in 1960 whereas in 2018, this cohort accounted for around 15 August 1945 of the whole U.S.A. population. Driven by rising incidences of polygenic disorder and therefore the incontrovertible fact that the U.S.A. has one amongst the very best per capita tending expenditures, the U.S.A. marketplace for polygenic disorder medication has grownup at a CAGR of around eleven.8% throughout 2011-2018, reaching a price of US$ forty five.4 Billion in 2018.Diabetes has increasingly become a lifestyle related disease as it afflicts young and old. As the number of patients grow across the globe, there has never been a stronger and more urgent need for novel therapeutic measures in clinical and preclinical evaluation, that arrest the growth of the disease. The diabetes market, consisting mainly of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is large and growing significantly. Global diabetes market is expected to grow at CAGR of 7.6% for the forecasted period of 2018-2023.the market is segmented on the basis of type of diabetes, drugs class and diabetic devices. Diabetic drugs have the highest market share amongst drugs and devices and are also expected to have the highest growth rate with a CAGR of 8.9% . some of the top selling diabetic drugs include Lantus(sanofi), Januvia(Merck and Co), Humalog(Eli Lily And Co),Novo rapid(Novo Nordisk),Levemir(Novo Nordisk),Victoza(Novo Nordisk),Janumet(Merck And Co),Novolog(Novo Nordisk),Humalin (Eli Lily And Co) and Galvus (Novartis).with the diabetic population expected to cross the 350 million market by 2030 the market is expected to show strong growth rate. Diabetic drugs are highly priced which could be one of the major drawbacks.Diabetes drug research market in Europe is expected to progress with a 5.08% CAGR over the forecast years of 2018-2026. It is the second largest market for diabetes drugs. High blood glucose kills about 3.4 million people annually worldwide. Approximately 80% of these deaths take place in underdeveloped and developing countries, and almost half are people aged less than 70 years. As per recent research in WHO diabetic deaths will double between 2005 and 2030. India had 69.2 million people living with diabetes (8.7%) in 2015. About 90% of the patients are suffering from Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Research Market is expected to grow at the average CAGR of 6.5% time period of 2016-2023. India's Diabetes Market is growing rapidly. India is expected to grow US$ 7441.6 million by 2023 from US$ 4778.7 million in 2016. The data varies from $263 billion spent in North America to $147 billion in Europe and Northern Asia. Followed by China, Mongolia, South East Asia and Oceania with a total of $88 billion. Why Chicago?As per reports, over 1,300,000 people in Illinois have diabetes or 12.8% of the population. Illinoisans are increasingly feeling the effects of diabetes. In 2018, reports states USA as third largest country worldwide in terms of diabetes patients. The increasing rate of diabetes patients are expected to grow more in coming years demands new advancements in research thus producing a bigger market for diabetes related products/procedures.Societies Associated with Diabetes Research: SBDR - Society for Biomedical Diabetes Research Austrian Diabetes Association Flemish Diabetes Association Association of Juvenile Diabetes Canadian Diabetes Association Juvenile Diabetes Foundation of Chile German Diabetes Union Diabetic Society of Singapore Japan Diabetes Society Hong Kong Diabetes Federation The International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology Royal Society of Medicine Endocrinology and Diabetes Section International Society of Psych neuroendocrinology International Neuroendocrine Federation European Society of Endocrinology Clinical Endocrinology Trust Swiss Diabetes Society Spanish Diabetes Society Korean Diabetes AssociationDiabetic Research Centers World wide:University of Michigan Albert Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes CenterBoston AreaColumbia UniversityIndiana UniversityJohns Hopkins University/University of MarylandJoslin Diabetes Center - Harvard Medical SchoolStanford UniversityUniversity of Alabama at BirminghamUCSD-UCLAUCSFUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of MichiganUniversity of PennsylvaniaUniversity of WashingtonWashington UniversityVanderbilt UniversityYale UniversityAlbert Einstein College of MedicineEmory UniversityKaiser Foundation Research InstituteUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of ColoradoInternational Diabetes Federation, UAEPublic Health Research Center, Abu Dhabi, UAEImperial College London Diabetes Centre, UAEGlobal Diabetes Research Centre, India.Diabetes Research Center, PUMCH, ChinaCenter for Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, JapanLeicester Diabetes Centre, United KingdomGarvan Institute of Medical Research, AustraliaPersatuan Diabetes Indonesia Research CentreDiabetic Hospitals Across the world:Mayo Clinic – Rochester, MNCleveland Clinic – Cleveland, OH Massachusetts General Hospital – Boston, MAJohns Hopkins Hospital – Baltimore, MDUCSF Medical Center – San Francisco, CANew York-Presbyterian University Hospital of Columbia and Cornell – New York, NYYale-New Haven Hospital – New Haven, CTNorthwestern Memorial Hospital – Chicago, ILUCLA Medical Center – Los Angeles, CAUniversity of Washington Medical Center – Seattle, WAHospitals of the University of Pennsylvania-Penn Presbyterian – Philadelphia, PABrigham and Women's Hospital – Boston, MAFlorida Hospital Orlando – Orlando, FLCedars-Sinai Medical Center – Los Angeles, CABarnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University – St. Louis, MOBeaumont Hospital – Grosse Pointe, MIMount Sinai Hospital – New York, NYFroedtert Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin – Milwaukee, WILancaster General Hospital – Lancaster, PAUniversity of Kansas Hospital – Kansas City, KSKEM Hospital, PuneLakeshore Hospital &amp; Research Center, KochiAll India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), DelhiM.V.

Increasing Insulin Affordability,"An Endocrine Society Position StatementPrint PDFINTRODUCTIONInsulin is a lifesaving medication for people with diabetes. However, its cost has nearly tripled in the past fifteen years making it difficult for many patients to afford this medication and effectively manage their disease.1 This has put patient safety in jeopardy as patients opt to ration their insulin or forgo other medical care. Research indicates that a lack of transparency in the drug supply chain has made it challenging to identify the root cause of price increases. This position statement will identify barriers to accessing affordable insulin and potential policy solutions that could address this growing problem. BACKGROUNDMore than 30 million Americans have diabetes with another 84 million at risk for developing the disease.2 Having diabetes increases one's risk for serious health problems including heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, amputations, and death.3 Diabetes is also the most expensive chronic condition in the United States.4 Average medical expenses are 2.3 times higher for people with diabetes.5 In 2017, the cost of diagnosed diabetes was estimated to be $327 billion annually, with $237 billion in direct medical costs.6This equates to one-in-four health care dollars being spent on people with diagnosed diabetes.7 And since one-in-four are unaware they have the disease8, costs to the healthcare system are even higher than estimated.Given the complex nature of diabetes, it is essential that patients adhere to their medication regimen to avoid unnecessary complications and hospitalizations. However, adherence can be difficult as people with diabetes often have co-morbidities that require them to take multiple, costly medications or they may be unable to make sustained lifestyle changes that could improve outcomes. One study indicates that improved adherence among people with diabetes could prevent nearly 700,000 emergency department visits, 341,000 hospitalizations and save $4.7 billion annually.9 Recent increases in drug costs and changes to insurance design are some of the most common reasons for poor medication adherence, particularly for patients on insulin.10,11Rising Insulin CostsThe true cost of insulin can be difficult to pinpoint because of a lack of transparency in financial agreements between stakeholders in the supply chain, geographical differences in cost, and insurance coverage.12 From 2001-2016, the list price of Novolog, a commonly used insulin, increased by 353% per vial.13 Humulin U500 increased from $170to more than $1,400 since 1987.14 From 2001-2015, the price of Humalog increased 585% for a vial of insulin.15 GoodRx.com, a website that aggregates claims data to estimate the average list price of medications (the price of insulin without the negotiated discounts or rebates), published cost information per vial (1000 units) for commonly prescribed insulins in August 2018. The following prices are averaged from Walgreens and CVS pharmacies:Lantus: $302Humalog: $322Novolog: $336Humulin N: $180Novolin N: $155Basaglar: $261*Levemir: $394Toujeo: $338*Humulin R: $180Novolin R: $155Humulin 70/30: $177Novolin 70/30: $156Novolog 70/30: $338Humalog 75/25: $351Tresiba: $388*Apidra: $368Admelog: $254*cost based on conversion to 1000 unitsCurrently, 7.4 million Americans use insulin to treat their diabetes.16 At minimum, these patients use one vial of insulin each month. However, some patients require multiple vials of insulin or use multiple types of insulins (which necessitates multiple vials) each month. According to a survey conducted by the American Diabetes Association, 27 percent of respondents stated that insulin costs have affected their past year purchase or use of insulin. Thirty-four percent of families with children on insulin were impacted.17 Those affected by rising costs were more likely to experience adverse health effects than those for whom cost did not impact their purchase or use of insulin and twice as likely to experience negative emotions like stress and anxiety. Many of these patients were also forced to forgo other needs such as transportation (32%), utilities (30%), housing (27%), doctor's visits (32%), or other medications (36%)18, and were more likely to ration their insulin.Patient Cost-SharingInsurance plan design directly impacts out-of-pocket costs. Patients who are uninsured pay the list price of insulin. These individuals may be eligible for a manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance program (PAP), however, these programs are restrictive, difficult to navigate, and it is unclear how many patients are able to utilize them.Patients on some forms of commercial plans may need to pay full price, depending on the plan design, for their insulin until they meet an annual deductible and then pay a fixed co-pay. They may also be required to pay co-insurance, a percentage of the cost based on the list price of insulin that does not include rebates or discounts negotiated by the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).For patients with high-deductible plans (plans with a deductible greater than $1,350 for an individual or $2,700 for a family), out-of-pocket insulin costs are significant. Individuals must pay for the full list price of insulin until they meet their annual deductible. In 2016, approximately 40% of Americans had a high-deductible health plan with an average annual deductible of $4,358 for individual health plans and $7,983 for family plans.19 In the same year, 44% reported selecting plans with annual deductibles of $6,000 or greater in 2016.20Medicare beneficiaries with Part D coverage without a supplemental plan must also pay full price for insulin until they meet their deductible, after which point they will pay co-insurance until meeting their plan's initial coverage limit for prescription drugs ($3,750 in 2018).21 At this point, they experience the Part D ""donut hole"", a coverage gap between the plan's initial coverage limit and when catastrophic coverage kicks in. While Medicare beneficiaries are in the donut hole, they will pay 35% of the plan's cost for covered brand-name prescription drugs until reaching their annual out-of-pocket limit of $5,000 in true out-of-pocket spending. Catastrophic coverage will then begin, and the Medicare beneficiary will pay a small co- insurance or copayment for covered prescription drugs.22In some cases, purchasing medications outside of their pharmacy benefit allows patients to pay lower costs. So-called ""gag rules"" have prevented pharmacists from counseling patients about options to take advantage of this cost-savings and should be eliminated.There are many stakeholders across the drug supply chain who influence rising costs, including wholesalers, PBMs, pharmacies, health plans, and employers. While manufacturers establish the list price, each of these players impact the out-of-pocket cost to a patient on insulin through a complex series of negotiations and rebates not transparent to the public. The lack of transparency makes it difficult, if not impossible, to understand how much each stakeholder gains when costs to the patient increase. Research indicates that while list prices have skyrocketed, the net price increase that manufacturers earn has risen at a far slower rate (3-36% net increases).23 Increasing transparency is critical to understand this divergence and other contributors to rising insulin costs.CONSIDERATIONSComplexity of the Supply ChainThe complexity of the supply chain makes it difficult to pinpoint the drivers behind increasing insulin prices. Manufacturers set the list price for the medication and typically sell their medications to wholesalers or PBMs. The process to get the medication from the manufacturer to the patient is rather straightforward, but the flow of money and the methodology to establish the price that the patient ultimately pays is much more complex. The net price manufacturers receive is based on the list price minus any fees paid to the wholesaler, discounts paid to the pharmacy, and rebates paid to the PBMs or health plans. Financial agreements between the stakeholders are confidential. For example, manufacturers are not privy to the PBM's negotiations with the health plans.Despite significant financial incentives negotiated between the stakeholders in the supply chain, most of these savings are never shared with the consumer. As such, an individual's cost is largely based on the list price. As list prices grow at double-digit rates, people with high-deductible plans, co-insurance, or no insurance suffer the effects.Net PriceThe process to establish the net price involves the exchange of rebates, discounts and other payments to encourage the purchase of a drug. For example, a manufacturer may offer distributor volume discounts to purchase their drug or provide financial incentives to a PBM for placement on the preferred tier of their drug formulary. Manufacturers cite these financial incentives as a major driver of high list prices; the more incentives provided to the players across the supply chain, the higher the list price must be for the manufacturer to realize any profit. In theory, the rebates offered to a PBM to place the drug on their preferred formulary tier should reduce costs for the patient. However, these rebates may be used by the employer or the health plan to reduce insurance premiums, not the cost of the drug at point-of-sale. However, due a lack of transparency, it is unclear the extent to which premiums are actually affected.Patient Assistance Programs and Discount CardsTo address high out-of-pocket costs, manufacturers offer patient assistance programs (PAPs) that provide insulin at low or no cost to low-income patients who qualify. These requirements vary by company and patients must apply annually which can be problematic as PAPs can be difficult to navigate. Manufacturers also offer co-pay cards but these are typically used to incentivize the use of higher cost medications and have been shown to result in overall higher medication prices. Lower-cost AlternativesCompetition in the marketplace for both brand name and generics typically drives down prices. This has not been the case with insulin. The price of modern insulins has continued to increase despite the availability of multiple competing insulins on the market. In a true free-market economy, this should promote greater competition and drive down costs. Human insulins (i.e., NPH and regular insulins) have been available for decades, would be an effective therapy for some patients with Type 2 Diabetes, and can still be purchased at a significantly lower cost. However, most health care providers are no longer trained on how to use these.Value-based PurchasingSome experts believe that value-based purchasing (VBP) agreements have the potential to reduce drug costs. These agreements between manufacturers and health plans base payment on how effective a medication is at treating a disease and can be structured in different ways; if a drug does not improve outcomes or leads to poorer health among the health plan's patient population, the manufacturer will provide discounts, rebates, or refunds to the health plan. However, further research is needed to understand whether value-based purchasing agreements will reduce patient costs. Furthermore, regulatory barriers have limited the number of existing VBP contracts, thereby making it difficult to assess the real benefit of value-based purchasing on reducing drug costs.POSITIONSRising costs have made access to affordable insulin far more difficult for people with diabetes, especially low- income individuals, those on high deductible health plans, Medicare beneficiaries in the Part D donut hole, or those who are uninsured. Addressing insulin affordability is critical in ensuring that patients can effectively manage their diabetes and avoid unnecessary complications and hospitalizations. For many patients with diabetes, insulin is a life-saving medication. Policymakers should address drivers of rising insulin prices and implement solutions that would reduce high out-of-pocket expenditures for patients.The Endocrine Society believes the following policy and practice changes could help expand access to lower cost insulin.Greater transparency is needed across the supply chain to understand rising insulin costsFuture list price increases should be limited and reasonable financial incentives should be pursued by all stakeholders.To reduce out-of-pocket expenditures, cost-sharing should be limited to a co-pay. In addition, NPH and regular insulin should be available at no cost to the patient.Rebates should be passed along to consumers without increasing premiums or deductibles.Patient Assistance Programs should less restrictive and expanded to include more accessible and easier to complete applications that can be used for multiple programs (e.g. a common application).Health care providers should be trained to use lower-cost human insulins (e.g., NPH and regular), so they can prescribe as appropriate.When clinically equivalent options are available, physicians should consider prescribing the lowest cost insulin.The Federal government should address regulatory barriers to create a more favorable environment for the testing of incentive programs that reduce cost and improve care (e.g. value-based purchasing agreements).Electronic medical records should include up-to-date formulary and price information.Co-pay savings cards should be eliminated as they have been shown to incentivize the use of higher cost medications and raise the overall cost of drugs.Patients should be educated about low-income assistance programs (e.g. the Extra Help program under Medicare) and to ask their physicians about alternatives if they cannot afford their insulin.Gag rules, which prevent pharmacists from helping patients find less expensive ways to pay for their medications, should be eliminated.Hua X, Carvalho N, Tew M, Huang ES, Herman WH, Clarke P.

Post-culture media was collected and analyzed for IL-6 (a) or MCP-1 (b) by ELISA.GUID: AD29C6EA-3A0F-49B4-907F-3CB24531DF9DAbstractThe prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is higher in patients with type 2 diabetes, a disorder characterized by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. The role of hyperinsulinemia as an independent participant in the atherogenic process has been controversial. In the current study, we tested the effect of insulin and the insulin sensitizer, adiponectin on human macrophage foam cell formation. We found that both insulin and adiponectin increased expression of the type 2 scavenger receptor CD36 by ~2 fold and decreased expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 by more than 80%. In both cases regulation was post-transcriptional. As a consequence of these changes, we found that oxidized LDL (oxLDL) uptake was increased by 80% and cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) was decreased by ~25%. This led to 2–3 fold more cholesterol accumulation over a 16 hour period. As reported previously in studies of murine systems, scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) expression on human macrophages was down-regulated by insulin and adiponectin. Insulin and adiponectin did not affect oxLDL induced secretion of monocyte attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These studies suggest that hyperinsulinemia could promote macrophage foam cell formation and thus may contribute to atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.Keywords: insulin, atherosclerosis, macrophage, foam cell, CD36, ABCA1IntroductionCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in many developed countries and atherosclerosis accounts for most of the major pathology1,2. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a condition characterized by insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia, have a 2–3 fold increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease3–5. While there have been many studies that support the causative role of insulin resistance in cardiovascular disease from both epidemiologic and experimental perspectives6–11, there is very little evidence supporting a direct cause and effect relationship between hyperinsulinemia and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the role of hyperinsulinemia as an independent risk factor has been controversial. Several prospective population studies including the Quebec Cardiovascular study showed an association of high plasma insulin levels with increased risk of coronary heart disease12–17, but other studies, such as that of Welin and colleagues failed to show such an association18,19. Since hyperinsulinemia usually occurs in states of insulin resistance it is difficult to determine an independent role for hyperinsulinemia in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Excessive lipid accumulation by macrophages plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Lipid laden macrophage foam cells accumulate in atheromatous plaque and promote inflammation by secreting cytokines that recruit other immune cells to the arterial intima. Foam cells are generated by uncontrolled uptake of modified LDL, especially oxidized LDL (oxLDL), and/or impaired cholesterol efflux20,21. Lipid homeostasis in macrophages is regulated by scavenger receptors, including CD36 and scavenger receptor-A (SR-A), that mediate uptake and specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family transporters that mediate cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and high density lipoprotein (HDL)22–25. Thus, alteration in expression of these molecules in macrophages may affect foam cell formation and progression of atherosclerosis.Adiponectin, also known as Acrp30, is an adipokine exclusively expressed and secreted by adipocytes that functions as an insulin sensitizer. Plasma concentrations of adiponectin are low in type 2 diabetic patients26,27 and mice lacking adiponectin have hepatic insulin resistance 28. Administration of adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity in animal models of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance29,30. The precise molecular mechanism by which adiponectin sensitizes cells to insulin signals has not been elucidated, however, it appears to include cross-talk between adiponectin and insulin receptor signaling pathways31. Adiponectin was recently suggested to have an anti-atherogenic effect through regulation of SR-A and acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1) expression in macrophages32,33.In the current study we used human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages to test the effect of insulin and adiponectin on macrophage expression of scavenger receptors and ATP-binding cassette transporter sub-family A member 1 (ABCA1) and on oxLDL uptake, cholesterol efflux and foam cell formation. We found that insulin and adiponectin up-regulated CD36 expression and down-regulated ABCA1 expression, resulting in enhanced oxLDL uptake, diminished cholesterol efflux and increased foam cell formation.Materials and MethodsReagentsLDL prepared from human plasma was oxidatively modified as previously described using a myeloperoxidase, glucose oxidase, nitrite system34. Bovine insulin was from Sigma and recombinant human adiponectin from R&amp;D systems. Polyclonal antibody against human CD36 was from Cayman Chemical. Monoclonal anti-human CD36 IgG, phycoerythrin- conjugated anti-CD36 IgG, and antibodies against SR-A, actin, and α-tubulin were from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against ABCA-1 and EMR1(F4/80) were purchased from Abcam. C14-labeled cholesterol was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. ApoA1 protein was prepared as previously described35. Quantikine® Colorimetric Sandwich ELISA kits for IL-6 and MCP-1 were from R&amp;D systems.CellsHuman monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and were cultured in RPMI containing human AB serum (10%) for 7 days to allow for macrophage differentiation. The differentiation of the monocytes into macrophages was confirmed by flow cytometry with anti- EMR1(F4/80) antibody. Human peripheral blood was donated by non-diabetic healthy volunteers. Each sample was screened and the absence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was confirmed.Immunoblot AnalysesHuman macrophages incubated with different concentrations of insulin (300pM, 2nM, 100nM), adiponectin (2μg/ml), oxLDL (50μg/ml), {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""LY294002"",""term_id"":""1257998346"",""term_text"":""LY294002""}}LY294002 (10μM) or wartmannin (100nM) for 16 hours were lysed with buffer containing 1% triton X-100. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), and probed with antibodies against CD36, ABCA-1, SR-A, actin, or α-tubulin. Band intensities were quantified by ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics) and Gel-Pro Analyzer (MediaCybernetics).Flow cytometryHuman macrophages plated on serum-coated glass coverslips were incubated with insulin, adiponectin, or oxLDL for 16h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Treated macrophages were gently scraped and collected in microtubes and then stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD36 or anti-SR-A IgG prior to measuring flourescence intensity by flow cytometry with a Becton-Dickinson FACScan. Data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star). To assess oxLDL uptake oxLDL was labeled with the fluorescent probe 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanide perchlorate (diI; Molecular Probes) as previously described36. Macrophages pre-incubated as above with insulin or adiponectin for 16h were then exposed to diI-oxLDL (10μg/ml) for 20min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by laser confocal microscopy. Fluorescence uptake was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated by Tri reagent from human macrophages treated with insulin, adiponectin, or oxLDL for 16h and was converted into cDNA by reverse transcriptase (Roche) with oligo-dT primer. cDNAs were then used for PCR with the primers 5′-CAG AGG CTG ACA ACT TCA CAG-3′, 5′-AGG GTA CGG AAC CAA ACT CAA-3′ for CD36 or the primers 5′-AAC TCT ACA TCT CCC TT CCC G -3′, 5′-TGT CCT CAT ACC AGT TGA GAG AC-3′ for ABCA-1. PCR for actin was used as a reference with the primers 5′-GTG GGG CGC CCC AGG CAC CA-3′, 5′-CTC CTT AAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TTC-3′. PCR amplification was 22 cycles of 94°C for 1minute, 56°C for 1 minute, 72°C for 2 minutes for CD36, 28 cycles for ABCA-1, and 17 cycles for actin.Cholesterol Efflux AssayMacrophages plated on 24 well dishes were treated with insulin (2nM, 100nM) or adiponectin (2μg/ml) with or without wartmannin (100nM) for 16 hours. OxLDL (50μg/ml) was incubated with C14- labeled cholesterol (0.2μCi/ml) at 37°C for 30 minutes and then loaded onto the macrophages. After 6 hours, C14-cholesterol-labeled cells were washed with PBS and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium for 16 hours. C14-cholesterol released from the cells into the medium was measured using scintillation counter. Cellular cholesterol was extracted by hexane:isopropanol (3:2 v/v) and C14 radioactivity in the extract solution was measured by scintillation counter. Efflux percentage was calculated as C14 radioactivity in medium/(C14 radioactivity in medium + C14 radioactivity in cells) × 100%.Intracellular cholesterol measurementHuman macrophages plated in 6 well dish were incubated with insulin (2nM, 100nM) or adiponectin (2μg/ml) with or without {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""LY294002"",""term_id"":""1257998346"",""term_text"":""LY294002""}}LY294002 (10μM). The cells were treated with oxLDL for 16 hours and lysed by 0.5% triton X-100 containing buffer on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 17,000g for 30min at 4°C and the supernatant was collected for cholesterol measurement. Cholesterol was measured by using Cayman cholesterol assay kit (Cayman chemical). Briefly, the cell lysates were mixed with assay buffer containing cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase, HRP and ADHP (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine). Fluorescent product resorufin which was generated by the reaction between ADHP and hydrogen peroxide from cholesterol oxidation could be measured by fluorescence plate reader using excitation wavelengths of 530–580 nm and emission wavelengths of 585–595 nm. We also measured total cholesterol and free cholesterol of macrophages by using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Human macrophages were incubated with insulin (2nM, 100nM) or adiponectin (2μg/ml) with or without wartmannin (200nM) and then treated with oxLDL (50μg/ml) for 16 hours. These cells were resuspended with 900μl water and 100μl of 1μg/ml coprosternol in isopropanol and applied to the GC-MS as described previously37. We recorded the total ion mass spectra of trimethylsilyl(TMS) derivatives, extracted the GC chromatograms and calculated cholesterol content in each samples. The intracellular cholestserol of each sample was normalized by protein concentration of each sample.ResultsInsulin and adiponectin alter scavenger receptor expression in human monocyte-derived macrophagesImmunoblots for CD36 showed that insulin at 2 and 100nM and adiponectin at 2μg/ml increased CD36 expression in macrophages. The adiponectin concentration used was one that increased phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 to the same extent as did 100nM insulin (data not shown). The increase in CD36 was prevented by pre-treatment of the cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitors {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""LY294002"",""term_id"":""1257998346"",""term_text"":""LY294002""}}LY294002 or wartmannin (). The inhibitors themselves had no effect (), unlike what was previously reported for murine macrophages38. Although the magnitude of effect on CD36 expression induced by insulin or adiponectin varied among cells from different donors, cumulative data from 15 different subjects showed a mean increase of 2 fold (; p &lt; 0.05).Insulin and adiponectin increase CD36 expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages(a) Macrophages were pretreated with indicated concentrations of insulin or adiponectin for 16h and then lysed and assessed by western blot for CD36 expression. In some cases cells were also treated with {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""LY294002"",""term_id"":""1257998346"",""term_text"":""LY294002""}}LY294002 (10μM) or wartmannin (100nM). Blots were stripped and re-probed with anti-tubulin antibody and fold change in CD36 band density was determined from scanned images. Image is representative of n=15. (b) Means ± SD of data from 15 different donors normalized as in panel (a); * P&lt;0.05. (c) Flow cytometry histogram of cells treated with insulin or adiponectin and then stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD36 IgG. (d) Mean fluorescence intensity was assessed by flow cytometry as described in (c). The bar graph of comparison was generated from experiments using macrophages from 5 different subjects; * P&lt;0.001. (e) mRNA isolated from cells treated with insulin or adiponectin was assessed by RT-PCR using specific primers for CD36 and actin. (f) Macrophages pretreated with insulin or adiponectin along with or without oxLDL, were assessed by western blot for CD36 expression as described in (a).Using flow cytometry we showed that the increase in total CD36 protein levels induced by insulin or adiponectin were associated with a significant, dose-dependent increase in macrophage cell surface CD36 expression (). Cumulative data from 5 different subjects showed that 100nM of insulin and 2μg/ml of adiponectin induced mean increases of 1.36 fold and 1.47 fold, respectively (; p&lt;0.001). CD36 mRNA levels measured by RT-PCR did not change after macrophages were exposed to insulin or adiponectin (), suggesting that CD36 regulation was post-transcriptional. OxLDL known to up-regulate CD3639,40, had additive effect in CD36 increase when combined with insulin or adiponectin ().SR-A, the other major scavenger receptor on macrophages for modified LDL41, was also regulated by insulin, but in the opposite direction to CD36. Immunoblots revealed that insulin induced a dramatic, dose-dependent decrease in expression of SR-A (). Immunofluorescence flow cytometry showed that insulin down-regulated SR-A surface expression and that adiponectin also down-regulated SR-A expression (). Interestingly, oxLDL which is known to up-regulate CD3639,40, decreased expression of SR-A in human monocyte-derived macrophages () and had additive effect when combined with insulin ().Insulin and adiponectin decrease expression of SR-A in human monocyte-derived macrophagesMacrophages were pretreated with insulin, adiponectin, oxLDL, or insulin plus oxLDL for 16h and analyzed by immunoblot (a) or flow cytometry (b) as in using a monoclonal antibody specific for SR-A. (a),(b); Experiments were repeated with macrophages from 3 different donors, respectively. (c) Mean fluorescence intensity was assessed by flow cytometry in (b). The bar graph of comparison was generated from experiments using macrophages from 3 different subjects; * P&lt;0.05.Insulin and adiponectin decrease ABCA-1 expression in human monocyte-derived macrophagesImmunoblots for the cholesterol transporter ABCA-1 revealed that insulin and adiponectin decreased ABCA-1 expression in macrophages by up to 80% (). Interestingly, PI3-kinase inhibition by {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""LY294002"",""term_id"":""1257998346"",""term_text"":""LY294002""}}LY294002 had no effect on adiponectin-mediated down-regulation and only a partial effect on insulin (). Insulin and adiponectin also induced down-regulation of ABCA-1 in the presence of oxLDL (), which by itself has been shown to increase ABCA-1 expression42. These data suggest that the regulatory mechanism of insulin and adiponectin on ABCA-1 expression may be distinct from the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) regulatory pathway activated by oxLDL42. This is further supported by analysis of mRNA levels () which showed no change in ABCA-1 levels after macrophages were exposed to insulin or adiponectin, in contrast to the 4.4 fold increase seen after exposure to oxLDL.Insulin and adiponectin decrease ABCA-1 expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages(a) Macrophages were pretreated for 16h with insulin or adiponectin in the presence or absence of {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""LY294002"",""term_id"":""1257998346"",""term_text"":""LY294002""}}LY294002 (10μM) and then lysed and analyzed by immunoblot for ABCA-1 expression. Blots were stripped and re-probed with anti-actin antibody and fold change in ABCA-1 band density was determined from scanned images. Image is representative of 3 repeatative bltos.. (b) Cells were exposed to oxLDL (50μg/ml) with or without insulin or adiponectin and analyzed as in panel a. (c) RT-PCR for ABCA-1 mRNA of macrophages treated as described in (b).Insulin and adiponectin enhance oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation in human monocyte-derived macrophagesHaving shown that insulin and adiponectin increased expression of CD36 and decreased expression of ABCA-1 in human macrophages, we next examined their effect on oxLDL uptake, cholesterol efflux and foam cell formation. To assess oxLDL uptake we added diI-labeled oxLDL to macrophages that had been exposed to insulin (100nM) or adiponectin (2μg/ml) for 16 hours and then measured intracellular fluorescence after 20 minutes using confocal microscopy. As shown in , insulin increased uptake by ~80% (p &lt; 0.05) while adiponectin had no effect ().Insulin and adiponectin enhance oxLDL mediated cholesterol loading of human mononcyte-derived macrophages(a) Macrophages were pretreated with insulin (100nM) or adiponectin (2μg/ml) for 16h and then exposed to DiI-labeled oxLDL for 20min at 37°C. Fluorescence uptake was quantified by digital confocal microscopy using Imge-Pro software. The graph represents mean ± SD of 5 experiments analyzing 50–100 cells each (* P&lt;0.05). (b) Macrophages were pre-treated with insulin or adiponectin for 16 hours and then exposed to oxLDL containing C14-labeled cholesterol for 6 hours. C14-labeled cholesterol effluxed to apoA1 was measured by scintillation counting. The graph shows mean ± SD from separate assays using macrophages from 3 different donors (* P&lt;0.05). (c) Macrophages were pretreated with insulin or adiponectin as above and then exposed to oxLDL (50μg/ml) for 16h at 37°C. Intracellular cholesterol was measured by the cholesterol oxidation reaction method. The graph shows mean ± SD from experiments using macrophages from 3 different donors. (* P&lt;0.001) (d)(e); Macrophages pretreated with insulin or adiponectin were exposed to oxLDL (50μg/ml). Free (d) or total (e) cholesterol was measured by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).To evaluate the effect of insulin and adiponectin on cholesterol efflux from macrophages we loaded cells with oxLDL containing C14-labeled cholesterol and then measured the rate of C14 efflux to apoA1 in the culture medium. Pre-treatment with either insulin or adiponectin decreased efflux by ~25% (; p&lt; 0.05).We hypothesized that the increased macrophage uptake of oxLDL and impaired cholesterol efflux induced by insulin or adiponectin would result in intracellular accumulation of excessive lipoprotein derived cholesterol and ultimately in foam cell formation43. shows that after 16h of cell exposure to oxLDL, intracellular cholesterol content measured by enzymatic cholesterol assay was increased by 3 fold in macrophages pre-treated with insulin or adiponectin, compared to untreated cells. Total cholesterol and free cholesterol of macrophages measured by GC-MS also showed that free and total intracellular cholesterol of macrophages were increased by pre-treatment with insulin or adiponectin ().OxLDL is known to induce secretion of cytokines such as MCP-1 and IL-6 from mouse macrophages44. Here we show that oxLDL also increased secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 from human monocyte-derived macrophages (Supplementary Figure 1), but that neither insulin nor adiponectin affected baseline or oxLDL induced cytokine secretion.DiscussionHyperinsulinemia was first suggested as a risk factor for atherosclerosis more than 30 years ago, based on the observation that insulin levels are higher than normal in patients with ischemic heart disease45. Since then, there have been many clinical and experimental studies revealing that high levels of insulin precede development of arterial diseases in diabetic and non-diabetic patients12–17, 46–48. However, the role of hyperinsulinemia as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic coronary disease has been controversial. Mostly, hyperinsulinemia occurs with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and is regarded as a compensatory mechanism of insulin resistance. Many studies suggest insulin resistance as a risk factor for atherosclerosis based on its pathologic effects on dyslipidemia, hypertension, and a hypercoagulable state, which accelerate atherosclerosis6–11,49. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the link between hyperinsulinemia and atherosclerosis is causative, and this compels more experimental studies.Macrophages perform a crucial role in the atherogenic process by generating lipid laden foam cells20. Macrophages are known to express most insulin signaling molecules except insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS1) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4)50,51. Even though insulin activates the insulin receptor (IR)/IRS2/PI3K/Akt pathway in macrophages as in other types of insulin-responsive cells, there have been few studies investigating the biological functions of insulin signaling in macrophages. In the current study, we evaluated if insulin affects macrophage foam cell formation and found that insulin increased expression of CD36 and decreased ABCA-1, which may promote cholesterol accumulation in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Although the mechanism is not clear, the insulin-mediated regulatory mechanism of CD36 and ABCA-1 appear to be post-transcriptional based on our results from RT-PCR. A recent study showing that insulin increased CD36 expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or HEK 293 cells via regulating CD36 turnover52 supports our observation and permits a possible expectation that a similar regulatory pathway may be activated in macrophages. The mechanisms of insulin regulation of CD36 and ABCA-1 need to be studied and it appears to be that these proteins are regulated via different pathways.Adiponectin is known to enhance insulin sensitivity, however, the signaling mechanism by which adiponectin sensitizes insulin is not clear. In our study, adiponectin showed an overlapping signaling with insulin. Low concentration of adiponectin increased phosphorylation of Akt (Ser436) by the same degree as insulin and had the same modulating effect on CD36 and ABCA-1 as insulin ( and ). Previous studies showed that adiponectin had an anti-atherogenic property in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice53 and one of the suggested mechanisms was an inhibitory effect of adiponectin on SR-A expression and acetylated LDL uptake54. In our current study, we reproduced the previous finding and showed that both insulin and adiponectin decreased SR-A expression in macrophages. However, the net effect of adiponectin resulted in increased intracellular cholesterol accumulation, which was opposite of previous reports. In addition to SR-A, adiponectin is known to down-regulates acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1) that catalyzes cholesteryl ester (CE) formation33 and therefore, adiponectin treatment decreased acetylated LDL-induced CE accumulation in macrophages33, 55. These intriguing results may be due to the different sources of cholesterol for lipid uptake assays, different concentrations of adiponectin, and different modes of adiponectin activities. In our study using MPO-modified LDL (oxLDL) which is known to be a specific ligand for CD3656, adiponectin increased uptake of oxLDL via increased expression of CD36, while in the previous studies performed with acetylated LDL (acLDL), a specific ligand for SR-A57, adiponectin decreased acLDL uptake via a decrease in SR-A. Therefore, the effect of adiponectin in vivo may be determined by the specificity of modified LDL for different scavenger receptors.Changes in the protein levels of CD36 and ABCA-1 induced by insulin and adiponectin appear to be regulated by PI3-kinase. Our study showed that PI3-kinase inhibitor prevented the increase of CD36 expression induced by insulin and adiponectin () while it minimally blocked the effect of these reagents on the expression of ABCA-1 (). The functional effect of PI3-kinase blockade on the intracellular cholesterol of macrophages was varied among macrophages from different donors (). As expected, based on the minimal blockade of ABCA-1 decrease, the PI-3 kinase inhibitor had no effect on cholesterol efflux of macrophages () but partially prevented the increase of intracellular cholesterol by blocking increased CD36 expression.Atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes share similar pathologic mechanisms including elevation in cytokines like monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) which contribute to underlying inflammation of both58. OxLDL is abundant in both of these conditions and is known to induce secretion of these proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages 59. Previous studies have suggested anti-inflammatory activities of insulin by showing that insulin infusion to diabetic patients suppressed mononuclear cell expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-460. However, another study showed that prolonged exposure to insulin accentuated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced transcription of pro-inflammatory genes while short term exposure inhibited the transcription61. In our current study, insulin and adiponectin, also known to have anti-inflammatory activity62, did not affect oxLDL-induced secretion of MCP-1 and IL-6 in macrophages.In the current study, we propose evidence that insulin facilitates macrophage foam cell formation, although this is a topic of controversy. It is sometimes suggested that hyperinsulinemia in the presence of insulin resistance may not be metabolically effective, however, it is possible that one pathway may remain active when the other pathway is blocked by insulin resistance. Therefore, more studies are needed to show how insulin activates different pathways and may be involved in different biological functions specifically affected by insulin resistance. The risk of cardiovascular disease is 10 folds higher than normal in patients with type 1 diabetes63. Even though type 1 diabetes is characterized by impaired insulin secretion, it does not rule out the possible pathologic effect of hyperinsulinemia. Indeed, many patients with type 1 diabetes have hyperinsulinemia from excessive dose of insulin and resulting insulin resistance64. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia appears to drive insulin resistance 65. Therefore, for the proper management of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, more investigation about the role of hyperinsulinemia is required.In conclusion, we provide evidence that hyperinsulinemia may promote atherosclerosis by promoting macrophage foam cell formation in the setting of abundant oxLDL which has specific affinity to CD36.Supplementary Material1Supplementary Figure 1.

"List item Using a mouse model, researchers discovered that insulin controls a molecular pathway in the brain that activates during stress and leads to more weight gain - www.MedicalTalk.Net the Best Medical Forum for Medical Students and Doctors Worldwide","List item Using a mouse model, researchers discovered that insulin controls a molecular pathway in the brain that activates during stress and leads to more weight gain. New research explains why eating high-calorie foods when stressed may lead to more significant weight gain.Researchers have long been aware that stresscan lead to addiction and increase the risk of disease. Studies have also shown that chronic stress can change eating patterns and affect food choices. Although some people eat less while under stress, most tend to overeat and increase their intake of high-calorie foods.When stress occurs, the adrenal glands release a hormone called cortisol, which increases appetite and motivates a person to eat, especially foods high in fat, sugar, or both. In combination with high insulin — one of the hormones that control food intake, high cortisol levels are a key factor in so-called stress eating.Eating patterns vary from person to person, but some research suggests that a person's biological sex may affect their stress-coping behavior. A Finnish study, which included almost 7,000 adolescents, showed that females were more likely than males to overeat when under stress and had a higher risk of obesity.Understanding what controls stress eatingProfessor Herbert Herzog, head of the Eating Disorders laboratory at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Darlinghurst, Australia, recently led a team of researchers conducting a study in mice to understand what controls stress eating. The researchers published their findings in the journal Cell Metabolism .""This study indicates that we have to be much more conscious about what we're eating when we're stressed to avoid a faster development of obesity.""Prof. Herbert HerzogA part of the brain called the hypothalamus plays the most significant role in controlling food intake, while scientists have implicated the amygdala in emotional processing. In this study, the researchers made a discovery: an insulin-controlled molecular pathway in the brain that may lead to excessive weight gain.""Our study showed that when stressed over an extended period and high-calorie food was available, mice became obese more quickly than those that consumed the same high-fat food in a stress-free environment,"" says Dr. Kenny Chi Kin Ip, lead author of the study.How might obesity affect the brain?Cutting-edge MRI scans reveal brain changes in people with obesity.READ NOWThe molecule at the center of this pathway in the brain is called NPY. The brain produces this molecule naturally during stressful times, and the study showed that NPY stimulates the intake of high-calorie foods in mice.""We discovered that when we switched off the production of NPY in the amygdala, weight gain was reduced. Without NPY, the weight gain on a high-fat diet with stress was the same as weight gain in the stress-free environment,"" explains Dr. Ip.Stress and calorific foods create vicious cycleThe researchers analyzed the nerve cells that produced NPY in the amygdala and found that they had receptors for insulin, a hormone that the pancreas produces, which helps the body store and use glucose.In a stress-free environment, after a meal, the body produces insulin, which is responsible for delivering the glucose from the bloodstream to the cells so that they can use it for fuel. It also signals to the hypothalamus that it is time to stop eating.By comparing mice under stress with those that were stress-free, the researchers showed that the production of insulin increased only slightly during stressful times. However, when they compared stressed mice on a high-calorie diet with stress-free mice on a normal diet, they found that the levels of this hormone became 10 times higher in the former group.These high levels of insulin caused the nerve cells in the amygdala to become desensitized to insulin and to boost NPY levels.""Our findings revealed a vicious cycle, where chronic, high insulin levels driven by stress and a high-calorie diet promoted more and more eating,"" concludes Prof. Herzog.The research team was surprised to discover that insulin had such a significant effect on the amygdala. The results show that insulin does not only regulate functions in the peripheral regions of the body, but it may also affect important pathways in the brain. The team hopes to investigate these effects further in the future.",https://t.co/k9R6b59juX,others

The goal of this study was to investigate whether insulin regulates transcription of cytokines and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in Escherichia coli LPS-induced lung inflammation. Diabetic male Wistar rats (alloxan, 42 mg/kg, i.v., 10 days) and controls were instilled intratracheally with saline containing LPS (750 μg/0.4 mL) or saline only. Some diabetic rats were given neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (4 IU, s.c.) 2 h before LPS. Analyses performed 6 h after LPS included: (a) lung and mesenteric lymph node IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, and ICAM-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) were quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; (b) number of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 in the BAL were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; and (c) activation of NF-κB p65 subunit and phosphorylation of I-κBα were quantified by Western blot analysis. Relative to controls, diabetic rats exhibited a reduction in lung and mesenteric lymph node IL-1β (40%), TNF-α (∼30%), and IL-10 (∼40%) mRNA levels and reduced concentrations of IL-1β (52%), TNF-α (62%), IL-10 (43%), and neutrophil counts (72%) in the BAL. Activation of NF-κB p65 subunit and phosphorylation of I-κBα were almost suppressed in diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin completely restored mRNA and protein levels of these cytokines and potentiated lung ICAM-1 mRNA levels (30%) and number of neutrophils (72%) in the BAL. Activation of NF-κB p65 subunit and phosphorylation of I-κBα were partially restored by insulin treatment. In conclusion, data presented suggest that insulin regulates transcription of proinflammatory (IL-1β, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, and expression of ICAM-1 via the NF-κB signaling pathway.",https://t.co/sz8PTJcH1B,others
Closed-Loop System Boosts Diabetes Glucose Control,"(Diabetes Care, Flickr)29 Apr. 2019. A clinical trial shows an algorithm-driven glucose monitor and insulin pump system provides better control of glucose levels for people with type 1 diabetes than an insulin pump alone. Results of the trial appear today in the inaugural issue of the journal The Lancet Digital Health.Participants in the trial were people in France with type 1 diabetes, an inherited autoimmune disorder where beta cells in the pancreas do not produce insulin. Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed primarily in children or young adults, where the immune system is tricked into attacking healthy cells and tissue as if they were foreign invaders, in this case, insulin-producing beta cells. From 5 to 10 percent of people diabetes have the type 1 form.The study tested a closed-loop system made by the company Diabeloop in Grenoble, France combining real-time glucose monitoring with an insulin pump and a mobile phone handset that controls its operation. The system, known as the Diabeloop Generation 1, or DBLG1, uses a commercially-made glucose monitor and insulin pump worn on the abdomen and arm respectively, connected with Bluetooth transmissions. The system is controlled by a machine-learning algorithm in software written by Diabeloop that combines blood glucose readings made every 5 minutes by the monitor, with data entered by the wearer on food intake and exercise. The algorithm calculates those data with the individual's personal history to calculate an insulin dose. The handset can also transmit data to the cloud for distribution to the wearer's physician.The clinical trial enrolled 68 adult participants with type 1 diabetes at 12 sites in France, sponsored by a not-for profit organization, Centre d'études et de recherches pour l'intensification du traitement du diabète, or Ceritd. The study, led by Pierre Yves Benhamou, an endocrinologist and diabetes specialist at Grenoble University Hospital, tested the DBLG1 system against a continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump that participants controlled themselves, now considered the standard of care.After a 2-week training period, participants were randomly assigned to wear the DBLG1 system or use the glucose monitor and insulin pump alone for 12 weeks. Then after an 8-week wash-out period of using none of the devices, the 2 groups switched technologies and reported results for another 12 weeks. The study team looked primarily at the amount of time participants spent within safe glucose levels. The researchers also tracked periods and events outside of that safe glucose range, total insulin use, technical problems with the devices, and any adverse effects during the trial.Of the original 68 eligible recruits for the study, 5 dropped out mainly due to pregnancy during the trial. The amount of time, on average, participants spent within safe glucose levels was higher for DBLG1 participants (69%) than glucose monitor and insulin pump wearers (59%), a difference large enough for statistical reliability. However 5 episodes of low blood sugar levels occurred among the DBLG1 participants, compared to 3 incidents for the glucose-monitor and insulin pump group, which the researchers said were associated with hardware malfunctions or human error.The researchers say the results support using closed-loop systems like the DBLG1 for people with type 1 diabetes. A clinical trial in Europe testing the Medtronic 640G closed-loop system against an insulin pump returned similar results, as reported by Science &amp; Enterprise in October 2018.

Insulin Resistance,"What is Insulin Resistance?Insulin is a hormone that plays a dominant role in regulating various metabolic processes including blood sugar and body fat percentage. Under normal circumstances, this process is highly dynamic and constantly fine-tuned by the body. However, under certain conditions, the body becomes blunted to the regulatory effects of insulin. When this happens, the normal mechanism starts to fail and 'insulin resistance' sets in. As a result, blood sugar levels start to climb.To compensate the body increases its production of insulin, thereby causing insulin levels to rise. When it comes to regulating blood sugar, rising insulin levels are beneficial since it helps keep rising blood sugar under control. However, when it comes to regulating body fat percentage, rising insulin levels spell somewhat of a disaster. This is because the hormone insulin not only makes the body more effective at storing fat but also makes it more difficult to burn fat.The net effect is that your metabolism effectively slows down.How is metabolism regulated?All biochemical processes that take place in the body are initiated and controlled by a complex communication system that relies on messenger molecules that are able to convey biochemical instructions. Examples of messenger molecules are hormones, neurotransmitters and cytokines. Chemicals contained within pharmaceutical drugs or medicinal plant extracts also achieve their results through the same mechanism.Depending on their design, messenger molecules deliver their biochemical communication either broadly at a high level to a large audience, or more selectively at a local level in a more specific manner. They can also override or overrule each other, as well as strengthen or amplify another's message.Metabolism is a complex process which involves the regulatory activity of various different messenger molecules. It is commonly believed that the thyroid gland is in charge of this process. This misguided view is based on oversimplification, since the numerous regulatory tasks that insulin performs relating to carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism, as well as how insulin overrules virtually all other messenger molecules involved in the process, makes insulin the single most dominant controller of metabolism.What causes insulin resistance?Whilst genetic makeup, increasing age and certain disease states make you more prone to developing insulin resistance, lifestyle factors that lead to weight gain from the ultimate triggers. These include diet and a sedentary lifestyle. At the heart of the problem is excess body fat, not because of the space that it consumes within the body, but because excess body fat starts to release a range of messenger molecules that not only initiates a pathological communication process within fatty tissue itself but as a secondary consequence, spreads a message that usually results in disease to the rest of the body.Why excess body fat causes insulin resistanceTwo major mechanisms contribute towards weight gain. Not only do existing fat cells increase their fat content, but new fat cells are continuously being formed through a proliferation process. Individually, newly formed fat cells also start accumulating fat which collectively leads to accelerated weight-gain and the progressive enlargement of the total fat mass. In a more advanced state, this process leads to the distortion of fatty tissue, commonly referred to as cellulite.In the past, fat cells were accredited with only two main functions, namely that of storing calories for later use and preserving body temperature via improved insulation. However, in the presence of excess body fat, fat cells also assume a new biochemical communication function by starting to manufacture various messenger molecules including 'adipokines' and 'inflammatory cytokines'. These have an effect on many different tissue types and tend to interfere with the normal chemical function of the body. For reasons not completely understood, some inflammatory cytokines disrupt insulin's role on a cellular level when it comes to regulating blood sugar, leading to type 2 diabetes.Adipokines, on the other hand, initiate the process of new fat cell formation called 'adipogenesis'. In reality, by releasing adipokines and inflammatory cytokines, fat cells, in essence, become an endocrine organ which starts to function independently from the body. A vicious cycle ensues during which you become physiologically and biochemically altered, and you are virtually held hostage by your own abnormal fatty tissue.Blocking the communication process between fat cells at a cellular level, especially when it comes to the formation of new fat cells and the development of insulin resistance, has, therefore, become a modern therapeutic focus.Why elevated insulin levels cause weight gainInsulin performs several different functions that may lead to the accumulation of excess body fat. Firstly, insulin regulates fat production. After a meal, when the quantity of glucose that enters the system is more than what can be used for immediate energy requirements, insulin promotes the conversion of excess sugar into fatty acids. These are subsequently grouped as larger molecules called triglycerides and transported to the fatty tissue where it is stored.In the body, fat cells represent the ultimate energy store room. Starting life as a miniature pantry, these unique storage containers can rapidly expand in size to fulfil the role of a massive warehouse. Within the environment of fat cells, insulin fulfils the role of storeroom manager. By design, insulin's tasks are to firstly to fill each warehouse to maximum capacity and then secondly, to keep stock levels as high as possible by actively preventing fat from leaving.Inside a fat cell, however, another messenger molecule called 'hormone-sensitive lipase' (HSL) plays an opposing role to insulin. Acting as the dispatch manager of the warehouse, HSL has the sole task of releasing as much fat from the fat cell as possible so that it can be shipped off to fuel the metabolic furnace. In the presence of insulin, however, this biochemical function is overruled and fat effectively stays trapped inside fat cells. Only once insulin levels drop can HSL perform its duty by mobilising and releasing fat from the warehouse.The bottom line is that insulin not only helps you to gain weight but when levels are chronically elevated as in the presence of insulin resistance, it also makes it more difficult for you to lose weight.The medical consequences of insulin resistanceDoctors deal with the complications of insulin's obesity-promoting tendency on a daily basis. Whilst insulin is the critical regulator of blood sugar control, increased insulin levels may also lead to weight-gain. In fact, these effects can be rather counterproductive when treating an overweight diabetic patient.Various studies have confirmed the role that insulin plays in weight gain. This includes data obtained from two landmark studies; the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) and DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complication Trial). The most obvious example, however, can be seen in someone who develops an insulinoma, a rare tumour of the pancreas that secretes insulin. Besides developing low blood sugar, individuals with insulinomas also gain weight at an alarming rate and can become massively obese in a very short period of time.In the presence of insulin resistance, limiting insulin-associated weight gain through an insulin sparing mechanism has, therefore, become a novel therapeutic target.How is insulin resistance diagnosed?In clinical practice, a combination of fasting insulin and glucose levels are used. These are calculated according to the HOMA (Homeostatic Model Assessment) or QUICKI (Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index) method. In specialised medical research, however, a more accurate technique called the 'hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp' is used. Research has shown that results from the HOMA and QUICKI correlate reasonably well with clamping studies regarding accuracy.Although less precise, a more simple way to predict insulin resistance is to measure your waist circumference. According to American guidelines, males with a waistline measurement of more than 102cm and females measuring more than 88cm will be significantly more inclined towards insulin resistance. European guidelines are even more stringent, with 93cm for males and 79cm for females being the upper range of normal.How is insulin resistance linked to type 2 diabetes?Since some of the inflammatory cytokines that fat cells start releasing disrupt insulin's role on a cellular level when it comes to regulating blood sugar, insulin resistance is one of the leading causes of type 2 diabetes. This escalating process, however, may also fuel a vicious cycle of increased levels of insulin resistance and as a consequence, a greater requirement for insulin, thereby posing the threat of gaining even more weight. Whilst optimal glycemic control is essential to good health, weight gain is also known to accelerate some of the other disease processes associated with the metabolic syndrome, thereby potentially undermining the metabolic and cardiovascular benefits of optimal blood glucose control.What is the link between insulin resistance and inflammation?Excess body fat leads to the release of various inflammatory cytokines. In type 2 diabetics, insulin resistance is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. Since this process is a known risk to develop blood clots in the presence of hardening of the arteries, it is often used to explain some of the microvascular complications that occur in type 2 diabetes. However, there is also significant evidence to suggest that even before the clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is made, those with excess body fat have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and vascular thrombosis because of low-grade inflammation.What is the link between insulin resistance and PCOS?Besides playing the dominant role in metabolism, insulin has a number of other hormonal effects including the regulation of normal ovarian function and influencing a number of male hormones present in females. Increased levels of insulin, as caused by insulin resistance, causes a reduction in a hormone called sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver. This results in abnormally high levels of male hormones in women.What is the link between insulin resistance and stress?Various hormones are influenced by stress, especially cortisol, which has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance. It is also known that insulin resistance and the various inflammatory cytokines that are released by the fat cells during the process can result in far reaching biochemical consequences. These are known to have a negative impact on brain function, leading to concentration and mental processing problems, irritability and mood disorders, including depression, sleep disorders and dementia.",https://t.co/JWyi0GAOR0,others
11 Reasons Why Berries Are Among the Healthiest Foods on Earth,"By Franziska Spritzler, RD, CDEBerries are among the healthiest foods you can eat.They're delicious, nutritious, and provide a number of impressive health benefits.Here are 11 good reasons to include berries in your diet. 1. Loaded With Antioxidants Berries contain antioxidants, which help keep free radicals under control.Free radicals are unstable molecules that are beneficial in small amounts but can damage your cells when their numbers get too high, causing oxidative stress (1).Berries are a great source of antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol. In addition to protecting your cells, these plant compounds may reduce disease risk (2, 3).One study showed that blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries have the highest antioxidant activity of commonly consumed fruits, next to pomegranates (4).In fact, several studies have confirmed that the antioxidants in berries may help reduce oxidative stress (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).One study in healthy men found that consuming a single, 10-ounce (300-gram) portion of blueberries helped protect their DNA against free radical damage (8).In another study in healthy people, eating 17 ounces (500 grams) of strawberry pulp every day for 30 days decreased a pro-oxidant marker by 38% (9).SummaryBerries are high in antioxidants like anthocyanins, which may protect your cells from free radical damage. 2. May Help Improve Blood Sugar and Insulin Response Berries may improve your blood sugar and insulin levels.Test-tube and human studies suggest that they may protect your cells from high blood sugar levels, help increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce blood sugar and insulin response to high-carb meals (10, 11, 12, 13).Importantly, these effects appear to occur in both healthy people and those with insulin resistance.In one study in healthy women, eating 5 ounces (150 grams) of puréed strawberries or mixed berries with bread led to a 24–26% reduction in insulin levels, compared to consuming the bread alone (13).Moreover, in a six-week study, obese people with insulin resistance who drank a blueberry smoothie twice per day experienced greater improvements in insulin sensitivity than those who consumed berry-free smoothies (14).SummaryBerries may improve blood sugar and insulin response when consumed with high-carb foods or included in smoothies. 3. High in Fiber Berries are a good source of fiber, including soluble fiber. Studies show that consuming soluble fiber slows down the movement of food through your digestive tract, leading to reduced hunger and increased feelings of fullness.This may decrease your calorie intake and make weight management easier (15, 16).What's more, fiber helps reduce the number of calories you absorb from mixed meals. One study found that doubling your fiber intake could make you absorb up to 130 fewer calories per day (17).In addition, the high fiber content of berries means that they're low in digestible or net carbs, which are calculated by subtracting fiber from total carbs.Here are the carb and fiber counts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of berries (18, 19, 20, 21):Raspberries: 11.9 grams of carbs, 6.5 of which are fiberBlackberries: 10.2 grams of carbs, 5.3 of which are fiberStrawberries: 7.7 grams of carbs, 2.0 of which are fiberBlueberries: 14.5 grams of carbs, 2.4 of which are fiberNote that a typical serving size for berries is 1 cup, which converts to about 4.4–5.3 ounces (125–150 grams) depending on the type.Because of their low net carb content, berries are a low-carb-friendly food.SummaryBerries contain fiber, which may increase feelings of fullness, as well as reduce appetite and the number of calories your body absorbs from mixed meals. 4. Provide Many Nutrients Berries are low in calories and extremely nutritious. In addition to being high in antioxidants, they also contain several vitamins and minerals.Berries, especially strawberries, are high in vitamin C. In fact, 1 cup (150 grams) of strawberries provides a whopping 150% of the RDI for vitamin C (20).With the exception of vitamin C, all berries are fairly similar in terms of their vitamin and mineral content.Below is the nutrition content of a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of blackberries (19):Calories: 43Vitamin C: 35% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)Manganese: 32% of the RDIVitamin K1: 25% of the RDICopper: 8% of the RDIFolate: 6% of the RDIThe calorie count for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of berries ranges from 32 for strawberries to 57 for blueberries, making berries some of the lowest-calorie fruits around (20, 21).SummaryBerries are low in calories yet rich in several vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C and manganese. 5. Help Fight Inflammation Berries have strong anti-inflammatory properties.Inflammation is your body's defense against infection or injury.However, modern lifestyles often lead to excessive, long-term inflammation due to increased stress, inadequate physical activity, and unhealthy food choices.This type of chronic inflammation is believed to contribute to conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity (22, 23, 24).Studies suggest that the antioxidants in berries may help lower inflammatory markers (25, 26, 27, 28).In one study in overweight people, those drinking a strawberry beverage with a high-carb, high-fat meal noticed a more significant decrease in certain inflammatory markers than the control group (28).SummaryBerries may help reduce inflammation and decrease your risk of heart disease and other health problems. 6. May Help Lower Cholesterol Levels Berries are a heart-healthy food.Black raspberries and strawberries have been shown to help lower cholesterol in people who are obese or have metabolic syndrome (29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34).In an 8-week study, adults with metabolic syndrome who consumed a beverage made from freeze-dried strawberries daily experienced an 11% drop in LDL (bad) cholesterol (31).What's more, berries may help prevent LDL cholesterol from becoming oxidized or damaged, which is believed to be a major risk factor for heart disease (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37).In a controlled study in obese people, those eating 1.5 ounces (50 grams) of freeze-dried blueberries for 8 weeks noticed a 28% reduction in their oxidized LDL levels (37).SummaryBerries have been shown to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and help protect it from becoming oxidized, which may reduce your risk of heart disease. 7. May Be Good for Your Skin Berries may help reduce skin wrinkling, as their antioxidants help control free radicals, one of the leading causes of skin damage that contributes to aging (38).Though research is limited, ellagic acid appears responsible for some of the skin-related benefits of berries.Test-tube and animal studies suggest that this antioxidant may protect skin by blocking the production of enzymes that break down collagen in sun-damaged skin (39, 40, 41).Collagen is a protein that is part of your skin's structure. It allows your skin to stretch and remain firm. When collagen is damaged, your skin may sag and develop wrinkles.In one study, applying ellagic acid to the skin of hairless mice exposed to ultraviolet light for eight weeks decreased inflammation and helped protect collagen from damage (41).SummaryBerries contain the antioxidant ellagic acid, which may help decrease wrinkling and other signs of skin aging related to sun exposure. 8. May Help Protect Against Cancer Several antioxidants in berries, including anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol, may reduce cancer risk (42, 43, 44).Specifically, animal and human studies suggest that berries may protect against cancer of the esophagus, mouth, breast, and colon (45, 46, 47, 48, 49).In a study in 20 people with colon cancer, eating 2 ounces (60 grams) of freeze-dried raspberries for 1–9 weeks improved tumor markers in some participants, though not all (49).Another test-tube study found that all types of strawberries had strong, protective effects on liver cancer cells, regardless of whether they were high or low in antioxidants (50).SummaryBerries have been shown to reduce markers associated with tumor growth in animals and people with several types of cancer. 9. Can Be Enjoyed on Nearly All Types of Diets Berries can be included in many kinds of diets.Though people on low-carb and ketogenic diets often avoid fruit, you can usually enjoy berries in moderation.For example, a half-cup serving of blackberries (70 grams) or raspberries (60 grams) contains less than 4 grams of digestible carbs (18, 19).Liberal amounts of berries can be incorporated into paleo, Mediterranean, vegetarian, and vegan diets.For people who want to lose weight, the few calories in berries make them ideal to include in meals, snacks, or desserts.Organic and wild berries are now widely available in many parts of the world. When they're not in season, frozen berries can be purchased and thawed as needed.The only people who need to avoid berries are those who require a low-fiber diet for certain digestive disorders, as well as individuals who are allergic to berries. Allergic reactions to strawberries are most common.SummaryBerries can be enjoyed on most diets, as they're low in calories and carbs and widely available fresh or frozen. 10. May Help Keep Your Arteries Healthy In addition to lowering cholesterol, berries provide other benefits for heart health, including improving the function of your arteries.The cells that line your blood vessels are called endothelial cells. They help control blood pressure, keep blood from clotting, and perform other important functions.Excessive inflammation can damage these cells, inhibiting proper function. This is referred to as endothelial dysfunction, a major risk factor for heart disease (51).Berries have been found to improve endothelial function in studies in healthy adults, individuals with metabolic syndrome, and people who smoke (29, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56).In a controlled study in 44 people with metabolic syndrome, those consuming a daily blueberry smoothie showed significant improvements in endothelial function, compared to the control group (56).Though fresh berries are considered healthiest, berries in processed form may still provide some heart-healthy benefits. Baked berry products are considered processed, whereas freeze-dried berries are not.One study found that although baking blueberries reduced their anthocyanin content, total antioxidant concentrations remained the same. Arterial function improved similarly in people who consumed baked or freeze-dried berries (57).SummaryBerries have been found to improve arterial function in several studies in healthy people, those with metabolic syndrome, and people who smoke. 11. Delicious Alone or in Healthy Recipes Berries are undeniably delicious.

Michelle Steele's answer to Would you want Medicare for all if it doubles your taxes? - Quora,"But *would it* double the taxes?We have a version of Medicare in New Zealand and if anyone tried to change it, I'd go to the mat to fight to retain it. I'm from New Zealand which has a single payer health care system. I answered a question about some of the differences between NZ and and America, and two of the areas that I spoke about were taxes and the healthcare system.Health care is treated in New Zealand as a fundamental right for New Zealanders. I've had this conversation with a few Americans before and they tend to respond with ""but you pay more personal tax in order to cover the costs""… No we don't.Lower taxes in New ZealandIn New Zealand, we pay less tax then in America. In 2018, the average income in a US household was $61,372[1] and in NZ was $105,719[2](or USD $71,924).When I ran a basic single income comparison for the US against NZ using the same figures, Kiwis definitely pay less tax (our 'effective' tax rates are lower):Income (NZD) Tax Paid (USD) Tax Paid60,000 11,0202 13,52480,000 17,320 20,234100,000 23,920 27,049→ **AND…our healthcare is included in our tax payments** ←I understand that the average costs for health insurance in the USA are $9596[3] per year which is a significant value to pay on top of tax.In New Zealand, we pay a small fee to visit a doctor, $30 - 45, but hospital visits are free although we may be charged $160.00 for an ambulance if we need one. If a prescription is on our subsidy list (the vast majority are) then we pay $3 - $5 per prescription.If I need a heart bypass, I get a heart bypass and I don't pay for it. If I have cancer, they'll fix me (if possible). I can show up at the hospital (for repairs after fighting a plasterboard wall - heh) and the only reason that I might be asked to show ID is so that they can pull my medical records to check my medical history in order to offer the best care…not to ensure that I have the means to pay.The only thing that I receive in the mail is the follow up appointment.Our system of bulk negotiating and buying means that the price is massively decreased for everybody, making our tax payments go significantly further. Very few people will go bankrupt here because of medical issues.The efficiency given by a single payer system offers many, many benefits.Reduced logistic requirements.Bulk buying discountsLower costs due to a far simpler system requiring far less administrators.New Zealand only has 4.74 million people. If New Zealand can negotiate generic drugs down to a few cents each due to bulk buying - what kind of purchasing power would the USA have with 327.2 million people…if Medicare was allowed to bulk negotiate?Edit: There are people rationing insulin for crying out loud! ""People are dying"": Diabetics rationing insulin amid rising drug pricesIf New Zealand can run such a system in a way that offers significantly reduced taxes, then the USA should be able to negotiate a far better deal for its people. That should lead to reduced taxes - not doubled taxes.The New Zealand Health care system is not perfect (by any means) but it does place the importance of the heath and well being of New Zealanders above corporate profits.I absolutely hate seeing those heart breaking stories of people losing everything because of a medical issue. I see the fund raising pages from desperate parents trying to save their children. It's horrific and one of the saddest things about such a wonderful country. I think Americans deserve better, then to have their health needs used as a money making endeavor by big businesses.Footnotes[1] http://US median household incom...[2] http:// Household income and hou...[3] Here's how much the average American spends on health care",https://t.co/nEoFbBkA0a,others
Latest Technologies in Diabetes,"There have been tremendous advances in technology used for the management of diabetes over the past few years. Technologies most commonly reported are in the arena of needles and injections used in insulin delivery and devices that can manage blood glucose and prevent long-term complications.Insulin Pens Have Become Better, More Accurate and Less PainfulConventionally, insulin used to be given in syringes and a vial of insulin. In earlier days the needles were long and painful and the vial has to be kept in a refrigerator. All this changed when insulin pens were introduced. Insulin pens are more useful as they eliminate the need for drawing up a dose in a syringe. The ability to dial up the desired dose leads to greater accuracy and reliability, especially for low doses which are often needed in the elderly and in small children. The sensory and auditory feedback linked with the dial mechanism on many pens, also helps patients with visual impairment. Pen devices are also more compact, portable and easier to grip. Moreover as they are insulated, it is not necessary to keep the pen in a refrigerator. This makes life much easier especially for busy people who travel a lot. However, Insulin pens are more costly than insulin vials.Advances in Insulin Delivery Devicesa) Insulin pumpsAll patients with type 1 diabetes and many with type 2 diabetes require insulin therapy to control their blood glucose levels. Notwithstanding the tremendous advances made in insulin therapeutics over the past three decades, glycemic control remains suboptimal in the majority of patients on insulin. A major reason for this paradox is that the currently used insulin regimens do not exactly mimic the physiological secretion of insulin from the beta-cells of the pancreas. The insulin pump represents an attempt to provide insulin in a more physiological manner to patients with diabetes, avoiding the peaks and troughs in insulin levels seen with multiple subcutaneous injections.The insulin pump consists of a subcutaneous cannula inserted into the interstitial space (usually of the anterior abdominal wall), a connecting tubing and a small pager sized, battery operated pump which has the insulin reservoir as well as a microchip that controls insulin delivery according to pre-programmed rates.b) Artificial PancreasThese are modern insulin pumps with built in glucose sensors. The ultimate Artificial Pancreas (under development now) would be able to automatically deliver the correct doses based on the blood sugars and switch off the delivery if the sugars are low!Use of Technology in Monitoring Glucose LevelsBlood glucose metersBlood glucose meters have been used in clinical practice since the 1970's. However their widespread use started only in the 1990s after technological improvements led to a reduction in the cost of the meters and reagent strips. The latest glucose meters provide results that are comparable in accuracy to the venous plasma glucose estimations, at comparable or even lower costs.The advent of glucose meters and strips has made self-monitoring of blood glucose an integral part of diabetes care particularly in patients who are on insulin.Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)Today we have devices which can continuously monitor the glucose levels using sensors applied to the body. These are particularly useful for those who have fluctuating glucose levels.Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)The Ambulatory Glucose Profile device consists of a small sensor which is worn continuously by the patient for the duration of the profiling (up to 14 days). The glucose values recorded by the sensor are wirelessly transmitted to a reader (usually kept with the healthcare provider) and downloaded in the form of graphs using a proprietary software .The graphs provide glucose curves for each of the 14 days, as well as a ""modal day"" curve prepared by collapsing the readings from 14 days into a single curve.The AGP is an improvement upon the original continuous glucose monitoring system in its longer duration of recording and in that, there is no need of calibrating with a capillary glucose meter. It is also far less expensive. The FGM is a useful educational and motivational tool for patients in addition to helping the clinician plan and titrate anti diabetic drug regimens more accurately.Use of Mobile Phones (mHealth/mDiabetes) Today it's a mobile world. Smart phones are everywhere, giving more people instant access to information at their fingertips. This trend has led to growing popularity and use of mobile health technology. Mobile health technology is making health care more accessible and more flexible, places more power in the hands of patients, and is contributing to greater efficiency at medical practices. Various apps are now available to measure your diet, exercise and track your body weight glucose levels, blood pressure, cholesterol etc. You can also communicate the results to your doctor or health care provider making remote monitoring possible.Use of TelemedicineTelemedicine has now transformed into a complex integrated service used in hospitals, private physician offices, and other healthcare facilities. It has been used to overcome distance barriers and to improve access to medical services that would often not be consistently available in distant rural communities.Electronic Medical Record (EMR) can transform the way healthcare is delivered. EMR is a patient centered record, which contains medical, and treatment history of the patient and this information can be made available online whenever it is needed to authorized users.Precision Diabetes: Now in IndiaAt Dr. Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre, over the last several years we have developed algorithms by which a precise diagnosis of diabetes can be made. Applying the principles of 'Precision Diabetes', it will be possible in the near future to very accurately classify a patient and determine the type of diabetes he or she has, and then decide the type of treatment that this patient is likely to respond to. These are indeed exciting times in the field of diabetology.ConclusionsThis review sums up some of the technologies in practice for the management of diabetes. It ought to be remembered that any device or technology, is only as good as the person who uses it. The success of these technological advances will rely significantly on the willingness of patients and doctors to adopt them and to utilize them to the fullest.BiographyDr. V. Mohan is the Chairman and Chief of Diabetology at Dr. Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre at Chennai in South India which is a WHO Collaborating Centre for Non-communicable Diseases Prevention and Control and IDF Centre of Excellence in Diabetes Care. He is also President and Director of the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation which is an ICMR Centre for Advanced Research on Diabetes.Deeply interested in research from his undergraduate medical student days, Dr. Mohan has published over 1200 papers in peer reviewed journals including 750 original articles, 250 review articlesand invited editorials and 150 chapters to textbooks on Diabetes and Internal Medicine which is a world record by practicing doctor.

NASH Nuclear Receptors,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying the involvement of nuclear receptors in the pathogenesis of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) may oﬀer targets for the development of new treatments for this liver disease. The most common nuclear receptors used in drug and treatment discovery are ligand-activated nuclear receptors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), which were first identified as key regulators of the responses against chemical toxicants. Numerous studies using mouse disease models and human samples have revealed critical roles for these receptors and others, such as PPARβ/δ, PPARγ, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and liver X receptors (LXR), in maintaining nutrient/energy homeostasis in part through modulation of the gut-liver-adipose axis.NAFLD is associated with altered nuclear receptor function and perturbations along the gut-liver axis. These perturbations include obesity, abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism, increased inflammation, and insulin resistance. Nuclear receptors are essential to understanding the physiology and pathology of liver diseases like NAFLD/NASH, as they are at the crossroads of metabolism, inflammation, and regeneration. Modulation of nuclear receptors has been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis, inflammation, insulin resistance, fibrosis, and obesity, making them attractive – and effective – therapeutic targets.NASH Nuclear Receptors Current NASH research indicates drug and treatment discovery relies on Nuclear Receptor activation, specifically:Our NASH nuclear receptor assay products are cell-based reporter assay systems. They feature engineered nuclear receptor-specific reporter cells prepared using our unique CryoMite™ process. Once thawed, reporter cells are ready for immediate use. Test compounds can be screened for agonist or antagonist activities against human nuclear receptors expressed within the cytoplasm and nuclear environments of healthy, dividing mammalian cells.INDIGO Biosciences works closely with clients to provide the appropriate Nuclear Receptors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Research. To empower confident decision-making throughout the discovery process, our technology generates clear single receptor or full-panel screening results, making for better interpretation and more accurate data. Employing a luminescence-based method and our proprietary CryoMite™ preservation process, we provide reproducible results lot-to-lot about the efficacy, potency, and selectivity of your compounds, plus comprehensive lab reports that include helpful graphics, summaries, and insights.Read more about INDIGO Biosciences' Assay Kit Platforms &amp; Formats Here Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is characterized by liver inflammation and the buildup of extra fat in liver cells not caused by excessive alcohol consumption. The liver naturally contains some fat, however, when the weight of the fat content of the liver is more than 5-10%, the condition is known as fatty liver (steatosis). NAFLD is the most common liver disorder in developed countries with more than 100 million adults and children affected in the United States alone. NAFLD occurs in people of all races and ethnicities, though research shows it to be most common in those of Latin American descent.Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most extreme form of NAFLD, and is a major cause of cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.The majority of people with NAFLD have no symptoms, though some may experience fatigue, dull upper right quadrant abdominal discomfort, and/or mild jaundice. Diagnosis typically occurs following abnormal liver function tests from routine blood test. Common findings are elevated liver enzymes and a liver ultrasound showing steatosis. A liver biopsy is the only widely accepted test for definitively distinguishing NASH from other forms of liver disease. Current estimates indicate that about 20 percent of people with NAFLD have NASH.According to P&amp;S Market Research, as of March 2017, more than 50 potential therapeutic candidates were in the pipeline. Certain factors - including unknown etiology, complex patho-physiology, and high treatment costs - make understanding how associated nuclear receptors respond and react key to further development.",https://t.co/8Bl14qMdgp,others
Insulin too pricey? Some options to cut costs for diabetics,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The skyrocketing price of insulin has some diabetics scrambling to cover the cost of the life-saving medication.Others are skipping doses or using smaller amounts than needed, and sometimes landing in the emergency room, patients and advocates told Congress recently.About 7.4 million Americans use insulin to keep their blood sugar at safe levels. Insulin needs vary by patient, as do costs depending on insurance coverage.Amid the public uproar about costs, drugmakers and some prescription plans are starting to offer patients bigger discounts. Express Scripts and its parent company, insurer Cigna, just began offering a month's worth of insulin to eligible patients for $25 per month. Express Scripts is now lining up other insurers whose prescription plans it manages.For most insulin and other diabetes medicines, manufacturers offer coupons reducing monthly out-of-pocket costs.The American Diabetes Association connects patients to assistance programs through www.insulinhelp.org , though not everyone qualifies.""We do not want anyone to skip or ration doses,"" says Dr. William Cefalu, the advocacy group's chief scientific officer.If you are struggling to afford insulin, tell your doctors, says Cefalu. They might be able to recommend a free clinic or patient assistance plan, or suggest cheaper options.If cost is an issue, here are other ways to save money:TRY OLDER KINDS OF INSULINTalk to your doctor about switching to older, cheaper kinds of insulin, suggests Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Dangerous blood sugar plunges are more common with those, as they don't control blood sugar as tightly as newer, more expensive insulins. Patients using older products such as Novolin and Humulin R must test their blood sugar more often, and more carefully time when they inject insulin before meals, Gabbay stresses.SWITCH TO VIALSPatients who've been using insulin pens — injection devices containing multiple insulin doses — could switch to insulin vials. They are cheaper but less convenient. It requires drawing insulin out of the vial into a syringe, which makes doses less precise, and the abdominal injections hurt a bit more. Another option is Basaglar, a cheaper near-copy of the popular long-acting Lantus insulin pens.CHECK INSURANCEReview your insurance company's list of covered medications for insulin with the lowest copayments; coverage and copayments often change in January and there may be cheaper choices. Other savings options include getting a 90-day supply instead of 30-day refills.SHOP AROUNDCheck prices at different pharmacies. Prices can vary widely for insulin, other diabetes drugs and the testing strips and lancets needed to check blood sugar levels. Patients can look up drug prices at multiple drugstores and get coupons for big discounts at the pharmacy counter at www.GoodRx.com . Or try www.healthwarehouse.com , which sells medicines at cash prices, which can be cheaper even if you have insurance.Medicare and Medicaid patients can't combine coupons with their insurance, but a coupon alone might be the cheapest option.The three main insulin makers offer savings, including:—Sanofi's Insulins ValYOU Savings Program offers uninsured and cash-paying patients one insulin vial for $99 or one insulin pen for $149 each month. Starting in June, it will offer up to 10 vials and/or pens of most of its insulins for $99. Its Sanofi Patient Connection offers low-income uninsured patients free insulin.—Eli Lilly will soon sell Insulin Lispro, a half-price version of its top-selling insulin Humalog KwikPens, for $265 per month. Its Lilly Diabetes Solution Center helps patients find affordable options.—Novo Nordisk has long sold an older insulin, ReliOn, through Walmart for about $25 a vial. It's now available through CVS Health and Express Scripts. Novo Nordisk offers copay savings cards for Tresiba and other insulins, plus patient assistance with generous income limits at www.NovoCare.com .___Follow Linda A.

Diasome's Liver Targeted Insulin,"Robert Geho, CEO of Diasome Pharmaceuticals, Inc.We spoke with Robert Geho, CEO of Diasome Pharmaceuticals, Inc. — www.diasome.com — about its nanotechnology additive that delivers insulin to the liver where it can substantially improve T1D glucose control.Normal vs Injected Insulin In normal human physiology, the liver stores glucose at mealtime when insulin is released by the pancreas to prevent hyperglycemia and releases glucose when it senses glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia. This critical capability of the liver is mostly bypassed with injected insulin since nearly all of this insulin is absorbed by muscle and fat and does not reach the liver. In contrast, muscle doesn't have glucagon receptors, so injected glucagon must directly stimulate liver action for glucose release to counteract hypoglycemia.Without liver-regulated glucose control, managing blood glucose is much more difficult. Faster and longer-acting insulins help, as do pumps and CGMs, but the fine-grained control of liver function promises much better control for people with T1D. Strong BondsDiasome nanotechnology creates strong bonds with insulin molecules that prevent insulin absorption by muscle and fat and enables that insulin to reach the liver where it can support normal physiological function. These strong bonds do not slow insulin action or diminish the duration of action. In fact, early studies show that getting more insulin to the liver speeds initial action and improves time in range. The company has developed hepatocyte directed vesicle (HDV) nanotechnology as an insulin additive. Their HDV nanotechnology is insulin-agnostic and has the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of all insulins by restoring the liver's natural role in glucose control. This applies to basal and bolus insulins, whether dosed via MDI or pumps.Shelf LifeHDV has the same shelf life as insulin or better, whether refrigerated or at room temperature. The combined HDV insulin product may be more stable and have improved shelf life.Phase 2 StudyDiasome's Phase 2 study, which just started enrolling patients, is ""designed to provide additional dosing guidance based on recently analyzed Phase 2 and Phase 2b clinical data,"" said W. Blair Geho, M.D., Ph.D., chief scientific officer of Diasome. This study is designed to optimize the ratio of long-acting to short-acting insulin therapies when using HDV.This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the effect of HDV added to insulin on a variety of standard diabetes outcomes including HbA1c, hypoglycemia, and bolus and basal insulin dosing in adult type 1 diabetes subjects whose starting HbA1c levels are between 6.5% and 8.5%. Diasome intends to enroll approximately sixty participants who will undergo a three-month run-in period on the standard of care therapy followed by three months of treatment with HDV plus insulin along with different long-acting insulin dosing rates. Douglas Muchmore, M.D., chief technology officer of Diasome, said, ""As the most clinically advanced developer of liver-targeted insulin in the industry, we continue to address where insulin goes after it is injected because of the critical importance of the liver in glucose metabolism."" Solution NeededRecent data from the top 80 US endocrinology clinics showed that mean A1C increased from 7.8% to 8.4% in the period 2010 to 2016 despite increased uptake of medical device technologies such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring use and faster, longer acting insulins. Tremendous strides have been made and more advances are coming but the cost of these advanced technologies and insulins is a huge barrier to wider adoption,"" said Robert Geho. ""We believe that Diasome's better biodistribution of insulin could provide much more cost-effective improved glucose control and could see wide adoption."" Liver ToxicityLilly and Novo abandoned their efforts to develop an insulin additive that limited fat and muscle absorption. Lilly went the farthest in its efforts, but its clinical trials showed unexpected liver fat and enzyme toxicity.Diasome's approach does not change the underlying structure of insulin. Instead, their approach is based on a charge-based bonding of the insulin molecules. This non-chemical approach has not shown any liver toxicity issues.Phase 3 TimingDiasome expects to begin Phase 3 Clinical Trials in early 2020 and if approved, hopes to have HDV additives in the market by 2022.Dosing ScenariosThere are multiple ways in which Diasome envisions HDV's integration into patient treatment. Diasome would welcome partnering with insulin manufacturers such as Novo and Lily such that HDV was pre-mixed with insulinsLocal pharmacies could add HDV to insulin vials they sellIndividual patients could add HDV to insulin they have purchasedDiasome has tested a broad range of HDV-to-Insulin mixture ratios and believes that HDV has a wide safety margin so patient mixing could be feasible.One very interesting aspect of HDV is that when mixed with older insulins the action profiles of these off patent and cheaper insulins are much improved which could lead many people to re-adopt NPH into their insulin regimen.CompanyDiasome has an oral HDV insulin capsule in its development pipeline. This oral capsule also has great promise because the HDV liver targeting system enables oral doses of insulin that are similar to injected insulin doses. Usually, much larger oral insulin doses are required because of the digestive system's ability to break insulin molecules down, but the HDV insulin appears to protect insulin from this barrier. Diasome was founded in 2004 and has raised multiple rounds of funding, including support from the JDRF T1D Fund in Boston. The most recent funding was in October 2018.Supporting ResearchTargeting insulin to the liver corrects defects in glucose metabolism caused by peripheral insulin delivery — article linkState of Type 1 Diabetes Management and Outcomes from the T1D Exchange in 2016–2018 — Diabetes Technology &amp; Therapeutics, Volume 21, Number 2, 2019, DOI: 10.1089/dia.2018.0384",https://t.co/EPER7JOodm,others
Understanding Inflammation and Insulin Resistance,"In 2017 the CDC estimated that more than 100 million Americans were living with prediabetes or diabetes. In a country of some 300 million people, this statistic accounts for almost one third of the population. And while this statistic is most certainly alarming, what is even more concerning is the percentage of pre-diabetic Americans who are unaware of the fact that they fall within this category. Pre-diabetes, as defined as having higher than normal blood sugar levels, is a condition that is caused by the body's struggle to take in sugar and turn it into energy. Instead of getting absorbed into our cells, the sugar sits in our bloodstream for longer, causing a rise in inflammation. The key to unlocking this gateway in our body is a hormone called insulin. But when insulin is unable to turn the lock and let sugar into our cells, it is known as insulin resistance. Research is finding that, what keeps sugar out of where it is intended to go – all starts with inflammation. When we think of inflammation, many of us tend to associate it with an injury such as an ankle sprain or a bump from a hard fall. While accidents are certainly one way to ignite inflammation, there are many other ways in which inflammation is fueled. Eating pro-inflammatory foods, weight gain and even something as simple as dehydration can cause inflammation to build up in the body. When inflammation becomes a regular occurrence in our everyday lives, insulin resistance occurs as well. Fighting Inflammation with Diet &amp; ExerciseFried foods, sugar and refined carbohydrate diets all increase inflammation in the body. Refined carbohydrates include foods such as white bread and buns, white rice, cakes, crackers, cookies and pastries. When someone consumes these foods on a regular basis, they are also regularly revving up their inflammation. In addition to minimizing your intake of these foods, there are foods that can also help reduce your inflammation. Anti-inflammatory foods work to reduce inflammation in a variety of ways; which is why eating a variety of anti-inflammatory foods, especially on a daily basis, creates a synergistic effect with the body's natural anti-inflammatory combat! Some of the very best anti-inflammatory foods that you can add to your routine are:Dark leafy greens including foods such as spinach, kale, arugula, swiss chard, mustard greens, and collard greensBerries especially blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and strawberriesNon-starchy vegetables in a variety of colors such as red tomatoes, orange carrots, yellow bell peppers, green broccoli, and purple cabbageHealthy fats especially avocado, pistachios, macadamia nuts and raw sunflower seeds While these four food factors can have incredible effects on the body's inflammation, you can also add exercise and hydration to the mix along with a number of additional foods to help you see expedited results. As stated earlier, weight gain leads to inflammation – which can lead to more weight gain. By adding in a consistent exercise routine, you are helping your body release natural anti-inflammatory chemicals. If you are someone who has been told by your doctor that your blood sugar is elevated, this anti-inflammatory nutrition and exercise plan may be a key player in allowing you to reduce your inflammation and get back on the right track with your health. Understanding the effects that foods and exercise have on the body is the first step, feeling better is next! At Panorama Wellness &amp; Sports Institute, the nutrition program works with each person as an individual to tailor a plan that provides a sustainable and nutritious lifestyle, paired with one of our consistent exercise programs, we can help you help yourself in fighting inflammation and insulin resistance.",https://t.co/shVVi5Lt7f,others
CrossFit Classes Designed for Older Adults,"At a recent wedding, 68-year-old Ellen Bonk showed a group of millennials how to ""get down"" to the Isley Brothers' Shout. ""When they sing 'a little bit softer now,' there was only one other person who got down lower to the floor than me and still got back up,"" Bonk says.When Bonk, a former hospital administrator, retired a few years ago, she could barely squat a few inches. The suburban Chicago woman had a bad knee and was out of shape from a sedentary lifestyle. Now, after a year participating in CrossFit classes, she can squat nearly to the ground and can bench press 50 pounds. ""I can do things I never dreamt I'd be able to do or even would have tried,"" she says.Bonk is among a growing number of CrossFit enthusiasts worldwide. The high intensity functional fitness program combines strength training with aerobic activity. It also promotes a diet of lean meats, nuts, vegetables and fruit.Former gymnast Greg Glassman opened the first CrossFit gym in 2001. There are now 15,000 facilities worldwide, making it one of the fastest-growing fitness chains.In CrossFit, participants perform functional exercises, meaning strengthening and aerobic activities that train and develop muscles to perform everyday tasks. For example, squats replicate the movement required to sit in a chair, and deadlifts mimic bending over to pick up a bag of groceries.Classes vary daily and can be scaled to any fitness level. Still, some older participants with physical limitations can feel intimidated working out with participants who can do things they can't, like lifting barbells overhead or climbing ropes.CrossFit Classes for Older AdultsThat's why CrossFit introduced special classes two years ago for participants who are older than 50. The movements in these classes are less complex and the exercises less rigorous. Translation: No rope climbing.Some CrossFit gyms call them ""Legends"" classes. Bonk's gym, CrossFit Iron Flag in Westmont, Ill., calls them ""Masters"" classes.But, whatever you call them, don't call them easy!At Iron Flag's 6 a.m. Masters class, nine participants grimace as they read the hour-long workout sheet Coach Melissa Gasper printed on the whiteboard: 63 dumbbell snatches, 63 wall balls, 63 kettlebell swings, 63 dumbbell push presses and 63 rows.A collective groan erupts from the group. ""Why 63? Why not 70?"" jokes 70-year-old Frank Getz.""You've done way more of these in other workouts,"" Gasper shoots back. ""Think about how you want to break them up to keep moving.""After a 15-minute warm-up that includes planks and stretches, the group gets down to business. The first exercise involves tossing a weighted ball up a wall, then squatting to catch it.Individual AttentionGasper has been coaching this group three days a week for a year, so she knows each participant's abilities and physical challenges. Getz has bad knees. Mary Tsoulos, 69, has arthritis in her hips. Tony Malone, 59, is recovering from shoulder surgery to repair an old sports injury. All of the group members need to modify some exercises.Gasper walks slowly behind the participants as they perform each movement. ""I'm making sure their bodies are moving in the plane they're supposed to be in,"" she explains. ""Once you start adding weight, if your mechanics aren't good, you're going to injure yourself.""Concern About the CrossFit Program's SafetySafety remains a big question for CrossFit, in general, not just for older adults. As yet, there hasn't been a comprehensive study on the risk of injury for those involved in the program.Mary TsoulosA handful of studies, including one released last fall by the Orthopedic Journal of Sports Medicine (OJSM), found CrossFit to be relatively safe compared to other fitness programs. But the OJSM study also found the risk of injury is greater for people during their first year of CrossFit training and for those who participate fewer than three times a week. The authors of the study recommended that CrossFit trainers offer beginner classes to help prevent injuries.Dr. Ross Arena, head of physical therapy at the University of Illinois-Chicago, says he supports any exercise program that gets people moving. But he advises patients with arthritis or back and knee issues to be cautious before starting CrossFit.""You probably would want to have those things checked out by a medical professional who would do additional diagnostic tests,"" Arena says.CrossFit Iron Flag interviews all new participants and puts them through six personal training sessions before they begin classes. Co-owner Kelly McGriff-Culver says that allows her to assess each participant's physical capabilities and limitations. ""Maybe they don't have overhead range of motion, so they really can't work on anything overhead until they work on mobility issues,"" she says.Exceeding Their Own ExpectationsAs the clock approaches 7 a.m. at Iron Flag, all nine of Gasper's Masters participants are sweaty, but satisfied. Everyone finished what they thought was an impossible workout in under an hour. ""It's what keeps them coming back. They don't think they can do it, but then they do,"" Gasper says.McGriff-Culver says a quarter of the 200 participants at her gym are older than 55, a segment she thinks will keep growing.CrossFit believes it's crucial for older adults to stay active in a supportive community and maintain a healthy diet.

Most common health problems, diseases, and symptoms are directly caused by insulin resistance, yet are treating every single one of these conditions with a separate drug. Insulin resistance is when the cells are rejecting insulin. This is caused by chronic exposure to insulin. Insulin resistance is a combination of insulin deficiency and a massive spike of insulin in certain other parts of the body. Insulin Resistance Health-Related Conditions- Metabolic syndrome - High blood pressure- High cholesterol - Belly fat - Fatty liver - Diabetes (kidney damage, peripheral neuropathy, neurological problems, eye problems)- Heart problems (clot, plaque, arrhythmias, cholesterol, high blood pressure)- Inflammation (joint, autoimmune, artery, digestive/cirrhosis)- Brain (Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's, cognitive, seizures)- PCOS (High androgen)- Decreased testosterone - Pre-diabetes- Cancer - Obesity â€"" Insulin is the main fat-storing hormone.Causes of High Levels of Insulin - High-carbohydrate diets- Chronic eating or frequent eating - Cortisol (stress hormone)Eric Berg, DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 53 years of age, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.

Insulin too pricey? Some options to cut costs for diabetics,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The skyrocketing price of insulin has some diabetics scrambling to cover the cost of the life-saving medication.Others are skipping doses or using smaller amounts than needed, and sometimes landing in the emergency room, patients and advocates told Congress recently.About 7.4 million Americans use insulin to keep their blood sugar at safe levels. Insulin needs vary by patient, as do costs depending on insurance coverage.Amid the public uproar about costs, drugmakers and some prescription plans are starting to offer patients bigger discounts. Express Scripts and its parent company, insurer Cigna, just began offering a month's worth of insulin to eligible patients for $25 per month. Express Scripts is now lining up other insurers whose prescription plans it manages.For most insulin and other diabetes medicines, manufacturers offer coupons reducing monthly out-of-pocket costs.The American Diabetes Association connects patients to assistance programs through www.insulinhelp.org , though not everyone qualifies.""We do not want anyone to skip or ration doses,"" says Dr. William Cefalu, the advocacy group's chief scientific officer.If you are struggling to afford insulin, tell your doctors, says Cefalu. They might be able to recommend a free clinic or patient assistance plan, or suggest cheaper options.If cost is an issue, here are other ways to save money:TRY OLDER KINDS OF INSULINTalk to your doctor about switching to older, cheaper kinds of insulin, suggests Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Dangerous blood sugar plunges are more common with those, as they don't control blood sugar as tightly as newer, more expensive insulins. Patients using older products such as Novolin and Humulin R must test their blood sugar more often, and more carefully time when they inject insulin before meals, Gabbay stresses.Patients who've been using insulin pens — injection devices containing multiple insulin doses — could switch to insulin vials. They are cheaper but less convenient. It requires drawing insulin out of the vial into a syringe, which makes doses less precise, and the abdominal injections hurt a bit more. Another option is Basaglar, a cheaper near-copy of the popular long-acting Lantus insulin pens.Review your insurance company's list of covered medications for insulin with the lowest copayments; coverage and copayments often change in January and there may be cheaper choices. Other savings options include getting a 90-day supply instead of 30-day refills.Check prices at different pharmacies. Prices can vary widely for insulin, other diabetes drugs and the testing strips and lancets needed to check blood sugar levels. Patients can look up drug prices at multiple drugstores and get coupons for big discounts at the pharmacy counter at www.GoodRx.com . Or try www.healthwarehouse.com , which sells medicines at cash prices, which can be cheaper even if you have insurance.Medicare and Medicaid patients can't combine coupons with their insurance, but a coupon alone might be the cheapest option.The three main insulin makers offer savings, including:—Sanofi's Insulins ValYOU Savings Program offers uninsured and cash-paying patients one insulin vial for $99 or one insulin pen for $149 each month. Starting in June, it will offer up to 10 vials and/or pens of most of its insulins for $99. Its Sanofi Patient Connection offers low-income uninsured patients free insulin.—Eli Lilly will soon sell Insulin Lispro, a half-price version of its top-selling insulin Humalog KwikPens, for $265 per month. Its Lilly Diabetes Solution Center helps patients find affordable options.—Novo Nordisk has long sold an older insulin, ReliOn, through Walmart for about $25 a vial. It's now available through CVS Health and Express Scripts. Novo Nordisk offers copay savings cards for Tresiba and other insulins, plus patient assistance with generous income limits at www.NovoCare.com .",https://t.co/7k3bT3LEkS,others
Diabetics Paying the Price in More Ways Than One,"People with type 1 and type 2 diabetes pay the price in more ways than one The cost of some brands of insulin has risen 555% in 14 years, forcing some people to cut back on how much medicine they give themselves—and risking serious health consequences. America's getting plenty angry about the rising cost of insulin—and no wonder. Between 2002 and 2013, the average price for this life-saving, injectable drug used by nearly 10 million Americans with diabetes has tripled, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA). ""No one who relies on insulin should have to wonder if they'll be able to afford it,"" the ADA asserts in an online petition for its Stand Up for Affordable Insulin campaign.1The ADA's action doesn't stand alone. In November (2016), Vermont senator and former contender for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders fired off a letter calling on the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission asking for an investigation of pharmaceutical makers Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi for possibly colluding on insulin price increases.2""Not only have these pharmaceutical companies raised insulin prices significantly—sometimes by double digits overnight—in many instances the prices have apparently increased in tandem,"" noted the letter, co-signed by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD). ""We have…heard from our constituents that the life-saving insulin they need is increasingly unaffordable,"" And in early January 2017, the New York law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann sued Novo Nordisk on behalf of the Lehigh County (PA) Employees' Retirement System alleging the company ""reported materially false and misleading earnings and forecasts"" that were ""inflated"" by price fixing.That's not all. The highly anticipated US introduction (in 2016) of the generic ""biosimilar insulin"" called Basaglar was supposed to put a lower-priced type of insulin on the market but that's not what happened, according to Amy Hess-Fischl, MS, RD, LDN, BC-ADM, CDE, a member of the OnTrack Diabetes editorial advisory board.""Basaglar (and Sanofi's version of Humalog, Admelog) were presumed to be cheaper options but they really are not,"" Hess-Fischl explains. ""Lantus' patent were expired and Lilly launched their version of glargine (the active ingredient in Lantus). Subsequently, Humalog's patent also expired, allowing Sanofi to launch Admelog. Both allowed another revenue stream with a different drug. So each company capitalized on that to make more money, not to make a more affordable insulin.""So the fight to make insulin less expensive for people who rely on it continues. Consider these examples:The cost of a vial of the short-acting insulin lispro (Humalog) increased 585% (from $35 to $234) between 2001 and 2015. By January of 2017, it reached $270, according to the drug-price website GoodRx.com.5 During the same time, the price of a vial of human insulin rose 555%, from $20 to $131, according to endocrinologist Irl B. Hirsch, MD, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington. And by January 2017, it hit $147 according to GoodRx.com.6Between 1987 and 2014, the wholesale price of a 20-ml vial of Humulin U500—a concentrated form of long-acting insulin that more and more people with diabetes are using to control blood sugar—rose from $170 to $1,200, according to Truven Health Analytics.3 By January of 2017, the list price was $1,400.7Many manufacturers, however, offer discounts and sponsor savings programs but they generally are only useful if you have insurance. GoodRx recently reported on the savings programs currently being offered for long-acting Basaglar insulin. Medicare/Medicaid patients are also generally left out of sponsored price-cutting programs. ""Copay or savings cards cannot be used with Medicare/Medicaid,"" notes Fischl-Hess, ""but can be used by people who are uninsured.""Here are links to other cost-saving initiatives: Switching Insulin Brand, Rationing Insulin and Other Dangerous PracticesThirty percent of the 29 million Americans with diabetes use insulin–alone or along with other medications–to keep blood glucose in check.4 While few pay the list price, rising costs are still a big problem for many. ""I'm hearing from patients who are scrambling to switch insulin brands to save money, which can be very dangerous if you don't do it carefully or choose something that doesn't work well for you,"" says Michelle Katz, LPN, MSN, a healthcare consumer advocate and author of the books Healthcare for Less and 101 Health Insurance Tips. ""Anyone who's uninsured has high health-insurance co-pays, or who has a high-deductible health plan is affected. Under the Affordable Care Act, you can buy health insurance with a low monthly premium, but you may have to pay the first $5,000-$6,000 in costs out of your own pocket—including the cost of insulin.""Irl Hirsch, MD, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, who has type 1 diabetes, notes that the sticker price for a 3-month supply of one type of basal insulin ranged from ""$978 at the pharmacy closest to my home in Bellevue, Washington, whereas on Good-Rx.com it can be purchased for ''only $880."" That's more than some can spend, he says. ""Some people have no choice but to ration their insulin or stop it completely,"" Dr. Hirsch says. This leads to rising blood sugar levels and higher risk for complications including vision loss, kidney failure, and nerve damage, he says. ""We've heard anecdotally about more diabetic ketoacidosis (a life-threatening high blood sugar condition) in the United States in the past 12 months,"" he says, ""but inaccessibility to insulin due to costs is not new in this country."" In one 2011 Emory University study of 164 people hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis (a life-threatening high blood sugar problem), 68% had stopped using insulin—and one in four of those said they had stopped because they couldn't afford it.""Even people who think they have good health insurance can't afford the copays,"" Hirsch says. ""I had a patient who called the other day, his copay this year for one vial is $150. He's on an insulin pump and uses two vials a month—that's $3,600 a year. A lot of people can't pay that much—and we're only talking about the insulin. In addition, you'll have to buy test strips, syringes, and other supplies. And if you're a type 2 who uses insulin, you may need other diabetes medications as well.""What's Making Insulin Prices Soar? Several factors are fueling the price hikes. Insulin makers have continually adjusted formulations, creating insulin ""analogs"" that are easier to use and less likely to trigger dangerous low blood sugar episodes—but that cost millions of dollars to develop, Johns Hopkins University researchers noted in a 2015 report in the New England Journal of Medicine.5 This practice, which the researchers call ""evergreening,"" keeps pricey brands under patent protection so other drug makers can't copy formulas and offer lower-cost versions. That's one reason there's no low-cost ""generic"" insulin in the US. Another reason: Insulin is a biologic drug produced in living bacteria or yeast cells and is more difficult to copy into a generic form.Basaglar's formula is equivalent to Lantus but as Hess-Fischl noted, Basaglar didn't end up providing a significantly lower-cost alternative. Plus, people with diabetes who prefer regular insulin are still coping with some sky-high medication bills.People with diabetes told OnTrack that keeping up with ever-increasing costs is not easy. ""My insulin has gone up and my insurance only kicks in after a $2,700 deductible,"" Lee Ann Tincher told OnTrack via Facebook. ""At over $240/vial plus pump supplies and additional meds required to avoid complications, how can we afford to do anything except treat this disease. Insulin was only $1.50/vial when I was diagnosed with Type 1 in 1969. It is a crime!""The ""cost is prohibitive,"" Marilyn Ann Throckmorton told OnTrack on Facebook—especially for people on Medicare who've hit the ""doughnut hole,"" a coverage gap when they must pay more for brand-name drugs. ""Insulin is 90 years old, and yet the cost continues to rise,"" she wrote. ""Last year my total cost for the FlexPen was $1,100 for a 3-month supply. This year it is $1,500. When I reach $2,600 I go into the doughnut hole and I have to pay 45% of the cost. We diabetics need help.""If you'd like to join the growing fight against rising diabetes-related costs, visit the ADA's website to sign the ""Stand Up for Affordable Insulin"" online petition. ADA is calling for more transparency in pricing and requesting Congress to hold hearings on the issue. Updated on: March 7, 2019Insulin Basics: An Expert's Guide",https://t.co/NoG6HHLoy9,others
CrossFit Classes Designed for Older Adults,"At a recent wedding, 68-year-old Ellen Bonk showed a group of millennials how to ""get down"" to the Isley Brothers' Shout. ""When they sing 'a little bit softer now,' there was only one other person who got down lower to the floor than me and still got back up,"" Bonk says.When Bonk, a former hospital administrator, retired a few years ago, she could barely squat a few inches. The suburban Chicago woman had a bad knee and was out of shape from a sedentary lifestyle. Now, after a year participating in CrossFit classes, she can squat nearly to the ground and can bench press 50 pounds. ""I can do things I never dreamt I'd be able to do or even would have tried,"" she says.Bonk is among a growing number of CrossFit enthusiasts worldwide. The high intensity functional fitness program combines strength training with aerobic activity. It also promotes a diet of lean meats, nuts, vegetables and fruit.Former gymnast Greg Glassman opened the first CrossFit gym in 2001. There are now 15,000 facilities worldwide, making it one of the fastest-growing fitness chains.In CrossFit, participants perform functional exercises, meaning strengthening and aerobic activities that train and develop muscles to perform everyday tasks. For example, squats replicate the movement required to sit in a chair, and deadlifts mimic bending over to pick up a bag of groceries.Classes vary daily and can be scaled to any fitness level. Still, some older participants with physical limitations can feel intimidated working out with participants who can do things they can't, like lifting barbells overhead or climbing ropes.CrossFit Classes for Older AdultsThat's why CrossFit introduced special classes two years ago for participants who are older than 50. The movements in these classes are less complex and the exercises less rigorous. Translation: No rope climbing.Some CrossFit gyms call them ""Legends"" classes. Bonk's gym, CrossFit Iron Flag in Westmont, Ill., calls them ""Masters"" classes.But, whatever you call them, don't call them easy!At Iron Flag's 6 a.m. Masters class, nine participants grimace as they read the hour-long workout sheet Coach Melissa Gasper printed on the whiteboard: 63 dumbbell snatches, 63 wall balls, 63 kettlebell swings, 63 dumbbell push presses and 63 rows.A collective groan erupts from the group. ""Why 63? Why not 70?"" jokes 70-year-old Frank Getz.""You've done way more of these in other workouts,"" Gasper shoots back. ""Think about how you want to break them up to keep moving.""After a 15-minute warm-up that includes planks and stretches, the group gets down to business. The first exercise involves tossing a weighted ball up a wall, then squatting to catch it.Individual AttentionGasper has been coaching this group three days a week for a year, so she knows each participant's abilities and physical challenges. Getz has bad knees. Mary Tsoulos, 69, has arthritis in her hips. Tony Malone, 59, is recovering from shoulder surgery to repair an old sports injury. All of the group members need to modify some exercises.Gasper walks slowly behind the participants as they perform each movement. ""I'm making sure their bodies are moving in the plane they're supposed to be in,"" she explains. ""Once you start adding weight, if your mechanics aren't good, you're going to injure yourself.""Concern About the CrossFit Program's SafetySafety remains a big question for CrossFit, in general, not just for older adults. As yet, there hasn't been a comprehensive study on the risk of injury for those involved in the program.Mary TsoulosA handful of studies, including one released last fall by the Orthopedic Journal of Sports Medicine (OJSM), found CrossFit to be relatively safe compared to other fitness programs. But the OJSM study also found the risk of injury is greater for people during their first year of CrossFit training and for those who participate fewer than three times a week. The authors of the study recommended that CrossFit trainers offer beginner classes to help prevent injuries.Dr. Ross Arena, head of physical therapy at the University of Illinois-Chicago, says he supports any exercise program that gets people moving. But he advises patients with arthritis or back and knee issues to be cautious before starting CrossFit.""You probably would want to have those things checked out by a medical professional who would do additional diagnostic tests,"" Arena says.CrossFit Iron Flag interviews all new participants and puts them through six personal training sessions before they begin classes. Co-owner Kelly McGriff-Culver says that allows her to assess each participant's physical capabilities and limitations. ""Maybe they don't have overhead range of motion, so they really can't work on anything overhead until they work on mobility issues,"" she says.Exceeding Their Own ExpectationsAs the clock approaches 7 a.m. at Iron Flag, all nine of Gasper's Masters participants are sweaty, but satisfied. Everyone finished what they thought was an impossible workout in under an hour. ""It's what keeps them coming back. They don't think they can do it, but then they do,"" Gasper says.McGriff-Culver says a quarter of the 200 participants at her gym are older than 55, a segment she thinks will keep growing.CrossFit believes it's crucial for older adults to stay active in a supportive community and maintain a healthy diet. ""For this population, these behaviors can mean the difference between life and death or living at home versus a nursing home,"" says company spokesman Russ Greene.Malone won't argue with that. He's convinced CrossFit saved his life. Since joining the Masters class two years ago, he's shed 50 pounds along with his diabetes medication. ""If I didn't do this, I might be on another medicine or injecting insulin. I was not going in a good direction,"" he says.Tsoulos credits CrossFit's recommended diet and workouts with reducing her joint inflammation from arthritis and increasing her flexibility. ""Until two years ago I couldn't cross my legs,"" she says. ""I was in a movie theater and automatically crossed my legs and went, Wow!""By Diane EastabrookDiane Eastabrook is a Chicago-based journalist.

Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise,"A single bout of aerobic exercise increases insulin sensitivity the next day. The effects of exercise on insulin secretion, the role of exercise-induced energy deficit, and possible dose-response relationships are not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion after progressively greater negative energy balance induced by exercise or diet. Acute energy deficits (20% or 40% of weight maintenance needs) were induced by a single day of aerobic exercise (cycling at moderate intensity, n=13) or dietary restriction (n=19) in healthy men and women (age: 26±2 yrs; body mass index: 21.8±0.5 kg/m2). Intravenous glucose tolerance tests in conjunction with minimal modelling were performed the next morning and blood samples were collected for 3 hours to measure glucose and insulin concentrations. Insulin sensitivity increased linearly after exercise-induced energy deficits (P=0.007) but did not change after equivalent diet-induced energy deficits (P=0.673). Acute insulin response decreased after both exercise (P&lt;0.001) and dietary restriction (P=0.005). The disposition index and glucose effectiveness were not affected by exercise (P=0.138 and 0.808, respectively), but both decreased after 40% dietary restriction (P=0.048 and 0.002, respectively). These results indicate that insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion are related to exercise energy expenditure, albeit in a different fashion (insulin sensitivity increases linearly, whereas insulin secretion drops to a nadir with a low exercise dose and does not decrease further). These changes cannot be replicated by equivalent energy deficits induced by dietary restriction, suggesting that exercise and diet have different effects on the mechanisms regulating glucose homeostasis. clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03264001 1Clinical Nutrition Research Centre (CNRC), Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and National University Health System, Singapore; 2Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and National University Health System, Singapore; 3Department of Endocrinology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore; 4Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore; 5Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; 6Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore; 7Section for Obesity Research, Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen; Frederiksberg, Denmark Corresponding author: Faidon Magkos, Ph.D. University of Copenhagen; Faculty of Science; Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports – Section of Obesity Research; Rolighedsvej 26, 1958 Frederiksberg C; Denmark; fma@nexs.ku.dk The authors have no conflicts of interest relevant to the content of this article.

Obviating much of the need for insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A re-assessment of insulin therapy's safety profile,"Current processes of care for diabetes mellitus (DM) were shaped during the era when insulin therapy was considered inexorable to the management of advanced stage type 2 (T2DM), though this no longer appears to be categorically true. There are also dashed hopes that insulin therapy can prevent or stall diabetes. While exogenous insulin remains a life-sparing tool for fully insulin-dependent DM, insulin therapy-induced hyperinsulinemia now appears to contribute to serious safety issues beyond hypoglycemia and weight gain. Iatrogenic and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are metabolic disruptors of β-cells, liver, muscle, kidney, brain, heart and vasculature, inflammation, and lipid homeostasis, among other systems. This may compromise β-cells, exacerbate insulin resistance (IR), and increase risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Striking associations between exogenous insulin and risks of CV events, cancer, and all-cause mortality in clinical trial and real-world cohorts caution that insulin may pose more harm than previously evidenced. At our disposal are numerous alternate tools that, alone or in combination, efficaciously manage hyperglycemia and glucolipotoxicity, and do so without inducing hypoglycemia, weight gain, or hyperinsulinemia. Moreover, these new tools support true precision therapy, as modern day drug classes can be aligned with the various mediating pathways of hyperglycemia at work in any given patient. Some also appear to promote β-cell survival, with intriguing data being presented for newer agents, such as incretins. As such, we encourage preferential use of non-insulin antidiabetic agents to injected insulin for the management of non-insulin-dependent patients with T2DM, including in advanced stage T2DM. The goal of this article is to augment existing literature to 1) correct misconceptions on the rationale and necessity for insulin therapy in T2DM, 2) discuss emerging negative safety data with insulin therapy, and, 3) offer a practical means to reduce reliance on insulin through delayed initiation, minimized dose, and, drug switching to safer agents, and, potentially, reframes processes of care.",https://t.co/TT3yXbFxth,others
Closed-loop insulin feasible for inpatients needing nutritional support,"medwireNews: Researchers show that closed-loop insulin delivery achieves markedly better glucose control than standard insulin management in hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition.The randomized trial, which excluded people with type 1 diabetes, took place across two hospitals in Switzerland and the UK, similar to the team's previous study of patients on general hospital wards. This latest study focused on patients requiring nutritional support, whom Roman Hovorka (University of Cambridge, UK) and co-researchers describe as ""one of the most challenging inpatient populations.""The team used the FlorenceD2W-T2 automated closed-loop system, a fully closed-loop system that the team says ""can accommodate the glycaemic challenges associated with enteral and parenteral nutrition—such as unanticipated dislodgement of feeding tubes, temporary discontinuation of nutrition, and cycling of enteral nutrition with oral intake.""They also used faster-acting insulin aspart to improve the responsiveness of the system to changing insulin needs.As reported in The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, during an average 6.7 days of use the 21 patients receiving closed-loop insulin delivery spent 68.4% of their time within the target blood glucose range of 5.6–10.0 mmol/L, which was the primary outcome. This was a 32.0 percentage point improvement over the 36.4% time in range achieved in the 22 patients in the control group, who continued their usual insulin regimen. This difference was driven by a 32.6 percentage point reduction in the amount of time patients spent in the hyperglycemia range.Closed-loop delivery increased the overnight time in range by a similar extent, and also produced significant reductions in average blood glucose concentration and glycemic variability. Despite this difference in glycemic control, the average total daily insulin dose did not significantly differ between the groups, and was in fact numerically lower in the closed-loop group, at 53.9 versus 40.3 units.In a linked commentary, Pieter Gillard (University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium) and co-authors note that the approach to insulin delivery in the control group was ""pragmatic and done in accordance with local clinical practice"" and suggest that use of a standardized protocol with clear glycemic targets might have narrowed the efficacy gap between that and closed-loop delivery.They also point out that although closed-loop delivery theoretically simplifies glucose management, staff will have to learn to deal with technical issues and create and implement back-up protocols for these instances, and for other times when automated delivery must be suspended.For example, closed-loop insulin delivery was suspended in four patients because of procedures or care transfers. In addition, three patients in the closed-loop delivery group discontinued treatment because of discomfort relating to the system, most often the additional finger-stick measurements required for calibration, as did seven patients in the control group (who also wore the continuous glucose monitoring device for assessment of time in range).This suggests that ""future work should focus on the acceptability of wearing these kinds of multifaceted devices and in motivating patients to do the necessary handling, such as finger-sticking, correctly,"" say Gillard and colleagues.By Eleanor McDermidmedwireNews is an independent medical news service provided by Springer Healthcare. © 2019 Springer Healthcare part of the Springer Nature group Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2019; doi:10.1016/S2213-8587(19)30061-0Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2019; doi:10.1016/S2213-8587(19)30094-4",https://t.co/t0KequMvkJ,others
Ups and Downs of Exercise for Women's Bone Health,"NEW ORLEANS -- Walking downhill on a treadmill within an hour after eating produced a large osteogenic response in postmenopausal women with diabetes -- an effect not seen with uphill walking, a researcher said here.In a randomized, partial-crossover trial, women who exercised downhill for 40 minutes had increased levels of C-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (a marker of bone formation) relative to no-exercise control and to walking uphill, reported Katarina Borer, PhD, of the University of Michigan, and colleagues.Women exercising downhill also had reduced insulin resistance to high-carbohydrate meals compared to women exercising uphill or sedentary women, demonstrated by Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) scores, she reported here at ENDO 2019, The Endocrine Society meeting.""Even if you are postmenopausal and you have low estrogen, or you're diabetic and your bones are more fragile, the bone is still alive and is responding to exercise,"" Borer told MedPage Today. ""But not any exercise, at any time, and not regardless of your prandial state."" Katarina Borer, PhD, discusses her findings at a press conference In this study, 15 women were assigned to participate in two of five experimental conditions: no exercise, walking uphill before a standardized meal, walking uphill after the meal, walking downhill before the meal, and walking downhill after the meal, on a treadmill that could be tilted upward or downward as desired. Borer and colleagues created an ""osteogenic ratio,"" which they defined as the level of CICP over the level of c-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), a marker of bone resorption.As expected, women assigned to walk uphill exerted a greater mean effort than women in the downhill group (75.2% vs 47.9%), whereas the downhill condition created a 38% greater strike force as measured with a shoe insert. This increased mechanical loading helps mitigate the loss of bone mass, Borer said.""Intuitively you'd think you're working harder going uphill and that it's going to be more beneficial, but actually you are unloading the bones because you're working against gravity,"" Borer said.Among women who walked downhill, exercising after the meal increased CICP by 44% and was linked to a 40% greater osteogenic ratio compared to exercising before the meal, researchers reported. In all women, the meals lowered bone resorption (CTX), regardless of whether they exercised up or downhill. Exercise before eating, irrespective of uphill/downhill direction, had no observable effect on these outcomes.Mone Zaidi, MD, PhD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said exercise could plausibly be one of many components contributing to bone fragility in women with diabetes, but that factors more related to the women's diabetes itself are more likely at play.For example, the longer a patient has diabetes, the more advanced glycation end products (AGE) accumulate, he said, and the concentration of AGEs in diabetic patients are known to be associated with fracture risk. This would need to be measured and controlled for in order for Borer's results to be interpreted with confidence, he said.On the other hand, the timing of meals pertains to hypoglycemic episodes experienced by patients with diabetes, and would also need to be carefully evaluated in a study linking eating to bone health, he added.""It doesn't seem you can tease it out that easily without including the big confounders,"" Zaidi told MedPage Today.The 15 women involved in this study were a mean age of 58 years, had been menopausal for about 7 years, were diabetic (fasting glucose 137.4 mg/dL), and were overweight (mean body mass index 27.3). They were also osteopenic with a mean z-score of 1.56. 2019-03-26T14:00:00-0400",https://t.co/6YiV14qO2J,others
The Price of Living,"In today's society, diabetics in the United States are struggling to pay for the one thing that is keeping them alive: insulin. For example, Alec Holt, a 26 year old diabetic from Minnesota, was taken off his parents insurance. He was unable to pay for his insulin on top of all the other supplies needed to take care of his diabetes. Holt began to ration insulin in order to have enough to use each day. Diabetics have to take certain amounts of this drug depending on the food they eat. Rationing it just isn't sufficient. Holt died in his apartment from ketoacidosis, a complication of high blood sugar causing the body to create an influx of blood acids called ketones. This happened because he couldn't afford something that he needed to stay alive. The rising costs of this drug have been a continued issue that has affected so many lives. Some diabetics have completely stopped buying insulin, which poses a huge risk to their health and could lead to major consequences.According to a USA Today article ""Struggling to stay alive: Rising insulin prices cause diabetics to go to extremes"" and a study by the Health Care Cost Institute, insulin prices nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016. People were paying an average of $5,705 for a drug that keeps them alive. Diabetics pay monthly for their insulin, so the price in 2016 would've been over $400 a month. As this price rises, less and less people are able to afford something that sustains their life. Diabetics all over the United States are affected by this, and it will continue to affect them their whole lives. The prices have continued to rise in 2019.This issue is worrying for many parents with children who have diabetes. A parent can only take care of their kid for so long. After moving out, young adults are expected to be able to keep themself alive all on their own. This may seem easy for a healthy person, but it can be incredibly hard for diabetics. In college, it's hard for students to stay out of debt and still be able to afford all their daily necessities. The risk of debt is on a different level for diabetics, as they have to pay for the extremely expensive insulin that keeps them alive. With insurance, the price would be slightly more bearable, however, for new adults with no insurance, this price could be described as life threatening. These high prices can cause people to act in very dangerous ways.Some diabetics have resorted to not taking their insulin. This poses huge risks to their health. Insulin balances out their blood sugar levels, ensuring that they don't go too high or too low. Type one diabetics can't live without this drug. Without the use of insulin in their lives, their bodies would scramble to make new energy out of fat and other things that aren't meant for it. In the absolute worst cases, not using insulin can lead to amputations, blindness, comas and even death. Type two diabetics can plan out the food they eat in order to ensure that the lack of insulin they are taking doesn't affect them. Without insulin, type one diabetics are basically defenseless in what could happen to them.Another way diabetics are avoiding the high price of insulin is by smuggling it from across the Canadian and Mexican borders. Prices in these countries are significantly lower than those in the United States, however, this is dangerous because the quality of this insulin is unknown. People could be buying a botched batch. In fact, an article from Kaiser Health News titled ""Americans Cross Border Into Mexico To Buy Insulin At A Fraction Of U.S. Cost"", the World Health Organization estimated that 10% of drugs in developing countries were either substandard or falsified. People are standing up against these high prices and pushing for change. Perhaps the biggest organization that is advocating for lower insulin prices is the American Diabetes Association. A petition can be found on their website, which has already received 480,029 signatures. Many diabetics post under #Insulin4All hoping that this will gain attention from the people who can make changes to these prices. Protests have happened all over the US in order to advocate for a more affordable price of this drug. Another way people are trying to make change is speaking to the representatives of their state to enact legislative change for more regulation on pharmaceutical companies and the prices they are setting. All these people coming together for this cause will hopefully bring positive outcomes.People with diabetes are putting their lives at risk because they can't afford a drug that is the only thing keeping them alive. Others without diabetes are fortunate enough to have a working pancreas that produces insulin, so these prices will never affect them. Diabetics are struggling to stay alive. They go to extreme lengths to avoid how high the prices have gotten. It is unfair that these people have to pay so much for something that they need to survive. Many people all over are seeking change. The government needs to regulate these prices, making them affordable for every diabetic in the US. Major pharmaceutical companies need to decide what's more important: money or a human's life.",https://t.co/XZP8ng9P9B,others
"Prediabetes: Symptoms, Diagnosis & Treatment","The day you're diagnosed with prediabetes can feel like a remarkably scary day. It can also be a day that motivates you to take action. While type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease (more on that later), there are still many things you can do to improve your blood sugars right away.In fact, prediabetes is type 2 diabetes in its earliest stages — which is why it shouldn't be dismissed or taken lightly. You've earned the ""pre"" in front of ""diabetes"" because while your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, they simply aren't high enough to qualify for full-fledged type 2 diabetes.For some, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes is ""reversible."" For others, it may not be. In this article, we'll look at the symptoms of prediabetes, how it's diagnosed, how it's treated, and whether or not it can be ""reversed.""Symptoms of prediabetesThe trickiest part of prediabetes is that the symptoms can be very subtle and easy to ignore for years — until blood sugar levels are high enough to catch your attention. The surest way to catch prediabetes in its tracks is by scheduling annual check-ups with your primary care doctor and requesting that your HbA1c level be tested. More on A1c's later….Like type 2 diabetes, the symptoms of prediabetes are the result of gradually increasing blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and inadequate levels of insulin.The most common prediabetes symptoms are:increased thirstincreased hungerfrequent urinationdry mouthheadachesfeeling tired after mealsinexplicable weight-gain or weight-lossblurry visionThe Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) report that as few as 10 percent of people with prediabetes are actually aware of their increasing symptoms.The CDC also estimates that 84 million American — 1 out of every 3 people — has prediabetes, most of whom don't know it.Diagnosing prediabetesThe American Diabetes Association qualifies a diagnosis of prediabetes based on your HbA1c and your ""fasting"" blood sugar level (when you first wake up in the morning) and 2 hours after eating a meal: HbA1c: 5.7 to 6.4 percentFasting blood sugar: 100 to 125 mg/dL2 hours after a meal: 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dLYou can compare those numbers to the blood sugar levels in a non-diabetic:Fasting blood sugar (in the morning, before eating): 70 to 90 mg/dL1 hour after a meal: 90 to 130 mg/dL2 hours after a meal: 90 to 110 mg/dL5 or more hours after eating: 70 to 90 mg/dLDiagnosing prediabetes or type 2 diabetes is actually fairly straight-forward, but the problem is that both you and your doctor may not see an A1c or blood sugar level in the ""prediabetes"" zone as the red-flag that it truly is. This is diabetes. It's just the earlier stages of the disease. You should take action. You should treat it with as much concern as you would if it was diagnosed as ""type 2 diabetes.""To be tested for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, you'll need to schedule a check-up with your primary care doctor and ask for these two blood tests: your fasting blood sugar and your HbA1c.What is your fasting blood sugar?Simply put, your fasting blood sugar is your blood sugar first thing in the morning before you eat breakfast. Since it's been typically has been more than 8 hours since your last meal, the fasting blood sugar indicates how your body has managed its blood sugar levels when variables like food are not present.What is the HbA1c test?Your HbA1c — also known as A1c — is a blood test that measures the amount of ""leftover"" glucose (also known as ""advance glycogenated end-products or ""AGEs"") that have accumulated in your bloodstream during the prior 3 months. The higher your A1c is, the more damage is occurring to your body's nerve endings and blood vessels in areas like your eyes, your fingers, and toes, and your kidneys.The more AGEs are present in your blood, the more damage is occurring that can develop into diabetes complications like retinopathy, neuropathy, hair-loss, gastroparesis, dermopathy, and nephropathy. The higher your blood sugars are each day, the higher your next A1c result will be!Factors that increase your risk of prediabetesWhile mainstream media often depicts type 2 diabetes as the result of being overweight, not exercising, and eating unhealthy food, it is significantly more complex.There are actually two pathways that lead to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.The first is basic insulin resistance, which means your body needs more and more insulin in order to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. At a certain point, the pancreas can't keep up with the demand, and blood sugars begin to rise.The second is a genetic disposition that results in the gradual dysfunction and destruction of your pancreas' beta-cells. Beta-cells play the leading role in insulin production, and many people with type 2 diabetes struggle to actually produce normal amounts of insulin.Determining which group you are in isn't easy, or even possible for the average patient. For patients in this second group, ""reversing"" diabetes isn't likely possible, but that doesn't mean you can't take steps towards improving your health isn't worthwhile.The most important factors that increase your risk of prediabetes are:If you are overweightIf you are age 45 years or olderIf you have a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetesIf you exercise less than 3 times a weekIf you had gestational diabetes during pregnancyIf you gave birth to a baby that weighed over 9 poundsIf you are African American, Hispanic/Latino American, American Indian, Pacific Islander, or Asian Americans. These ethnicities have all shown a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.How to reduce your risk of prediabetes &amp; type 2 diabetesWhether your diabetes is the result of insulin resistance or genetic beta-cell dysfunction, there are still many things you can do to improve your body's sensitivity to insulin and prevent or delay the further progression of the condition.Get movingThe more you exercise, the more calories and glucose your body burns over the course of 24 hours, and the more it burns even afterward when you're at rest. Even going for a 15-minute walk every day at lunch is a worthwhile start. Walking is often dismissed as not being intense enough to provide many benefits, but walking is actually a great way to burn fat and calories without increasing your appetite. It's also very easy on the joints, can be done on a treadmill or outside, and you can set your own comfortable pace. The next time you come home from work and think, ""I'm too tired to exercise,"" stop that pattern of thinking and commit to just 15 minutes of movement. Make a few changes to your dietEating a healthier diet doesn't mean you have to cut out all the things you love. Even making changes to one or two meals a day can have benefits. For example, maybe you start eating a very green salad loaded with fresh veggies for lunch instead of that footlong sub-sandwich. Or perhaps you start limiting your soda consumption to one can per day instead of 4 cans per day. Pick a couple of places to make changes so it isn't quite so overwhelming. Over time, you may find that you want to keep making improvements to other food choices, too. And remember, the goal doesn't have to be 100 percent perfection. The ""80/20 Rule"" is great: choosing healthy, real food 80 percent of the time, with 20 percent left for less-than-perfect treats.Get more sleepGetting too little sleep has been linked directly to a variety of issues that impact your blood sugars, hunger levels, weight-gain, mood, and cravings. A lack of sleep — especially a consistent lack of sleep — can take a tremendous toll on your insulin sensitivity, too, which means you'll need more insulin to regulate your blood sugars than normal. This can easily lead to weight gain, reduced energy, and higher blood sugars over time. There's no way around it — your body needs more sleep. Start improving your own sleep habits by setting an alarm or reminder in the evening to ding when you need to begin getting ready for bed. Lose weightEasier said than done, certainly, but all of the aforementioned steps towards reducing your risk of diabetes should also help you lose weight. Extra body fat, quite simply, increases your body's resistance to insulin. The more extra body fat you have, the more insulin it will take to help your body achieve healthy blood sugar levels. Losing weight also decreases inflammation levels, which decreases insulin resistance, too. *Do keep in mind: for some, losing weight may be challenging if your diabetes has progressed to type 2 diabetes already, and blood sugars are already significantly elevated. Talk to your doctor about medications that will help bring your blood sugars down while you continue to work on your weight-loss goals.Quit smoking. Nicotine has proven in research to actually make insulin less effective. Which means, as a smoker, you're creating higher levels of insulin resistance even if you're doing other healthy things like exercising and eating a healthy diet. Smoking actually increases your risk of diabetes by 30 to 40 percent. Quit smoking and instantly increase your sensitivity to insulin, thus improving your blood sugars without making any other changes.Can prediabetes be reversed?For some, prediabetes is reversible if it is the ""simple"" result of weight gain and unhealthy habits. For many, however, prediabetes is the result of the body's gradual destruction of beta-cells.Beta-cells play a critical role in insulin production. More and more research today regarding type 2 diabetes demonstrates that approximately 60 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are experiencing a lack of insulin production through ""beta cell dysfunction and destruction.""""It is now well recognized that 2 factors are involved: impaired [beta-cell] function and insulin resistance,"" explains John E. Gerich, MD, in a study published by the Mayo Clinic Proceedings. ""Prospective studies of high-risk populations have shown insulin-resistance and/or insulin-secretory defects before the onset of impaired glucose tolerance.""This means that while you should absolutely still pursue healthier habits around nutrition, exercise, weight-loss, sleep, quitting smoking, the gradual progression of your disease means your diagnosis is here to stay.That being said, making any changes you can in your habits can play a tremendous role in whether or not you need to start taking diabetes medications or if you need to start insulin injections to help bring your blood sugars down to a healthy level.Read more on ""reversing"" diabetes: Is Type 2 Diabetes Reversible?)Living well as a person facing a diagnosis of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes is very possible. The first step is to take action and do whatever is in your power to improve your body's sensitivity to insulin, improve your diet, get more exercise, get more sleep, and say goodbye to detrimental habits like smoking.Prediabetes is diabetes.

To investigate the effect of nonrenal organ dysfunction on tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 in this population.Method:In this ancillary analysis, we included patients with sepsis who were enrolled in either of two trials including 39 ICUs across Europe and North America. The primary endpoint was moderate-severe acute kidney injury (equivalent to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome stage 2–3) within 12 hours of enrollment. We assessed biomarker performance by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values at three cutoffs: 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 (ng/mL)2/1,000. We also calculated nonrenal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores for each patient on enrollment and compared tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 results in patients with and without acute kidney injury and across nonrenal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Finally, we constructed a clinical model for acute kidney injury in this population and compared the performance of the model with and without tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7.Results:We included 232 patients in the analysis and 40 (17%) developed acute kidney injury. We observed significantly higher urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 in patients with acute kidney injury than without acute kidney injury in both patients with low and high nonrenal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (p &lt; 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI) of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 was 0.84 (0.73–0.92) and 0.85 (0.76–0.94), in low and high nonrenal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score subgroups. Performance of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 test was not modified by nonrenal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (p = 0.70). In multivariate analysis, the addition of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 significantly improved the performance of a clinical model for predicting acute kidney injury (p = 0.015).Conclusion:Urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 accurately predicts acute kidney injury in septic patients with or without other organ failures.Keywords: acute kidney injury, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, organ dysfunction, risk prediction, sepsis, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complications of sepsis and is associated with an increased ICU and hospital mortality (1–7). The benefit of preventive and therapeutic measures for AKI has been difficult to confirm because treatments are often initiated when renal injury is already established (8, 9). Perhaps as a result, the prognosis for sepsis patients with AKI remains poor.Biomarkers for AKI might allow for earlier initiation or more tailored application of renal protection measures and avoidance of iatrogenic harm (10, 11). Two novel urinary biomarkers, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) have been validated for predicting moderate and severe AKI (classified as AKI stage 2 and 3 according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome [KDIGO] 2012 classification) (12) in critically ill patients. Both TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 are markers of cellular stress in the early phase of tubular cell injury caused by a wide variety of insults (inflammation, ischemia, oxidative stress, drugs, and toxins) (13–16). Furthermore, both molecules can initiate G1 cell-cycle arrest that prevents cells from dividing when potentially injured (17). Importantly, both biomarkers also act as ""alarm"" proteins exerting paracrine effects on adjacent cells (18). The product of these two biomarkers ([TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]) outperformed all other known biomarkers or biomarker combinations for predicting moderate-severe AKI (19), and the test has been validated using a clinical adjudication committee as a gold-standard for AKI (20). Finally, [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] measurement proved to be a highly sensitive predictor of AKI in cardiac surgery patients (21).Importantly, performance of novel biomarkers for AKI can suffer in patients with sepsis presumably because many of the pathologic processes of sepsis can affect biomarkers even without injuring the kidney (22). Furthermore, because the mechanisms of organ injury in sepsis may not be specific for the kidney, nonrenal organ failures could mimic AKI (23). Thus, we sought to evaluate the performance of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in patients with sepsis, with or without nonrenal organ failures. We assessed this biomarker combination in a subset of patients with early sepsis from the Sapphire (19) and Topaz (20) prospective clinical trials using cutoff values of greater than 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 (ng/mL)2/1,000 (24). At the time of biomarker measurement and adjusting for common sepsis risk factors, we evaluated test performance in conjunction with bedside clinical parameters.PATIENTS AND METHODSStudy DesignWe conducted a preplanned subgroup analysis of critically ill patients enrolled in either of our two previously reported studies on the discovery/validation (Sapphire) (19) and subsequent secondary validation (Topaz) (20) of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]. We defined sepsis based on international consensus criteria and the clinical diagnosis assigned by the treating physicians at enrolling sites (25). All patients were considered to be at high risk for AKI, characterized by respiratory or cardiovascular dysfunction as previously reported (Fig. ) (19, 20). The design, execution, and reporting of this study meet the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (26) and the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy criteria (27). Data were collected by the investigators and analyzed by independent statisticians not directly affiliated with the study. Both study protocols were approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia, Washington, DC) and also by the institutional review board or ethics committee of each study site if required. All patients (or authorized representatives) provided written informed consent. In this article, we present data from the Sapphire study, which defined AKI as KDIGO stage 2–3 (12), and from the Topaz study, which used clinical adjudication for AKI (20), in order to examine the performance of the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] test for risk assessment of AKI in patients with sepsis.Study design. Acute kidney injury (AKI) defined as Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) AKI stage 2 or 3 (Sapphire) (19) and determined by clinical adjudication based on KDIGO stage 2–3 AKI (Topaz) (18).MeasurementsUrine and serum samples for biomarker and creatinine assessment, respectively, were obtained within 24 hours of ICU admission. TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 concentrations were measured by immunoassay with the NephroCheck Test on the Asute140 Meter (Astute Medical, San Diego, CA) by technicians blinded to clinical data. Measurements of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were made at Astute Medical for the Sapphire study and in triplicate at three independent laboratories (University of California at San Diego, CA; University of Louisville, KY; and ARUP Laboratories in Salt Lake City, UT) for the Topaz study. The median of the triplicate values from Topaz was used for analysis, and values were reported in units of (ng/mL)2/1,000. Serum creatinine testing was performed as previously described (19, 20).We assessed severity of illness and organ dysfunction/failure with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III (28) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) (29) scores. Nonrenal APACHE III and SOFA scores were calculated by subtracting the renal components from these scores.Statistical MethodsTo assess the performance of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in predicting AKI, we calculated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV), and relative risk (RR). The Delong method was used to estimate the 95% CI for AUC. Bootstrap method was used to estimate the 95% CI for sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV, except for the cases where there were empty cells and the Clopper-Pearson Exact method was used instead. RR was calculated at each [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] stratum relative to the lowest stratum. The 95% CI for RR was calculated using bootstrap method except when there were empty cells, and an exact unconditional method was used instead (30).To examine the effect of nonrenal organ dysfunction and AKI on the levels of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7], we performed a multiple linear regression analysis where the response variable was rank transformed [TIMP2]·[IGFBP7]; the explanatory variables were AKI status, subgroup status according to the median of nonrenal SOFA scores, and the interaction between them. The same analysis was also performed for each individual nonrenal SOFA component.To assess the added value of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in predicting AKI over using clinical variables alone, we constructed two multivariable logistic regression models: one with only clinical variables as explanatory variables and the other with the addition of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] as an explanatory variable besides clinical variables. A backward stepwise regression procedure with Bayesian Information Criteria was used to select which clinical variables to be included the final models. Model goodness-of-fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow method. To quantify the added predictive ability of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7], we calculated integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and category-free net reclassification improvement (cfNRI) using R package ""PredictABEL"" (31). In addition, we compared the AUCs from these two models using the Delong method for paired AUCs.A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All reported p values are two sided. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R 3.1.0 (31).RESULTSBaseline and Clinical CharacteristicsWe included the 232 sepsis patients in the analysis, including 40 (17%) who developed AKI within 12 hours of testing. Baseline characteristics of all patients stratified by AKI status are shown in Table . Almost half of the patients were referred from the emergency department with relatively short delay between hospital and ICU admission (median [intraquartile range] time from hospital to ICU admission was 2 hr [0–8 hr]). Exposure to radiocontrast agents and nephrotoxic drugs and the presence of risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension were similar in patients who did or did not develop AKI. However, history of congestive heart failure and liver disease were more common in those patients developing AKI. Patients with AKI also had lower mean arterial pressure and were more often treated with vasopressors. Baseline serum creatinine and severity of illness as judged by baseline nonrenal APACHE III and SOFA scores were also greater for patients developing AKI (Table ).TABLE 1.Baseline Characteristics of Patients Grouped Acute Kidney Injury Versus No Acute Kidney InjuryBiomarker PerformanceThe unadjusted RR for AKI by strata of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] defined by three cutoffs (0.3, 1.0, and 2.0) are shown in Figure . The absolute risk in the low stratum (≤ 0.3) was 2.7% increasing to 53.3% in the highest stratum (&gt; 2.0) for an RR of 19.7 (95% CI, 4.3–69.4; p &lt; 0.001). Patients with AKI had significantly higher levels of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] than patients without AKI (p &lt; 0.001). This effect of AKI on [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] levels was not modified by nonrenal SOFA (p = 0.70). In addition, nonrenal SOFA subgroup did not affect [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] values after adjusting for AKI status (p = 0.29).Unadjusted relative risk (with 95% CIs) for acute kidney injury (AKI) stratified according to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] concentrations in all patients. AKI risk in strata with [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] values between 0.3 and 1.0, 1.0 and 2.0, and greater than 2.0 relative to risk in the stratum less than or equal to 0.3. Relative risk estimates for the upper two strata are significantly greater than 1 (*p &lt; 0.01, **p &lt; 0.001). Total of 40 AKI subjects and 192 no AKI. Absolute risk in the less than or equal to 0.3 stratum was 2.7% (95% CI, 0.33–9.4%). n = 74, 79, 34, and 45 for strata less than 0.3, more than 0.3 to less than or equal to 1.0, more than 1.0 to less than or equal to 2.0, and more than 2.0, respectively.The overall AUC for [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] for predicting AKI in this cohort was 0.84 (0.77–0.90). For patients with a nonrenal SOFA score of greater than 7, the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] AUC was 0.85 (0.76–0.94) and similarly for patients with nonrenal SOFA of less than or equal to 7, the AUC was 0.84 (0.73–0.92) (Fig. ). For comparison, the AUC for a serum creatinine measured at the same time as urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] yielded AUC of 0.73 (0.59–0.85) for patients with a nonrenal SOFA score of greater than 7 and AUC of 0.77 (0.65–0.87) for patients with a nonrenal SOFA score less than or equal to 7. Similarly, estimated glomerular filtration rate yielded AUCs of 0.75 (0.61–0.87) and 0.76 (0.63–0.87).Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] and acute kidney injury (AKI) status within 12 hr for all patients and for subgroups according to nonrenal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Boxes and whiskers show, respectively, interquartile ranges and total observed ranges, censored by 1.5 times the box range. Horizontal dashes within the boxes show the medians. SOFA scores were calculated from patient data collected on the day of enrollment. Patients with AKI had significantly higher levels of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] than patients without AKI (p &lt; 0.001 by Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In the linear regression model, where the response variable is rank transformed [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] and the explanatory variables are AKI status, SOFA subgroup status, and the interaction between them, the interaction was not statistically significant (p = 0.70). [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] was greater in patients with AKI than in those without AKI in both subgroups (p &lt; 0.001), and there was no statistically significant dependence of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] on SOFA subgroup regardless of the AKI status (p = 0.29).Of note, we reported previously that for patients with sepsis in the Sapphire study (19), the individual marker performance for TIMP-2 was superior to IGFBP7, whereas the opposite was true for surgical patients. Here, in this combined cohort of sepsis patients, we again saw a better AUC for TIMP-2 0.84 (0.77–0.90) compared with that for IGFBP7 0.79 (0.72–0.86). Interestingly, these results were unchanged across low and high nonrenal SOFA subgroups.[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] remained a strong predictor for AKI after adjustment for clinical variables, including severity of illness (APACHE III), nonrenal organ dysfunction (SOFA), body mass index, fluid output, and serum creatinine concentration. Addition of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] to a clinical model significantly improved its predictive ability from 0.86 to 0.94 (p = 0.015) (Table ). We also performed cfNRI and IDI. Table S1 (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/B893) shows that [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] improves the overall predictive ability of the model (statistically significant AUC increase, IDI, and cfNRI). ICU and hospital outcomes stratified by biomarker results are shown in Table S2 (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/B894).TABLE 2.Multivariate Analysis of the Clinical Model With and Without Inclusion of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2 and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 7 for Predicting Acute Kidney Injury in SepsisFinally, operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV) at all three cut-offs (0.3, 1.0, and 2.0) are shown in Table . Sensitivity remains near 95% and specificity near 90% for the 0.3 and 2.0 cut-offs, respectively. Table S3 (Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/CCM/B895) shows operating characteristics for [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] cutoffs ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 at 0.1 intervals.TABLE 3.Operating Characteristics (95% CI) for Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2 and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 7 Cutoffs 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0DISCUSSIONFor patients with sepsis, AKI is strongly associated with both short- and long-term adverse consequences (1, 2). Indeed, in a recent study of patients with septic shock, 60-day hospital mortality was 6.2% for patients without AKI, 16.8% for stage 1, and 27.7% for stage 2–3 (32). Early and adequate treatment of sepsis might prevent sepsis-induced AKI, attenuate AKI severity or might reduce the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) (33, 34). Rapid identification of septic patients at high risk for developing AKI could substantially improve the therapeutic approach. In this context, specific and sensitive biomarkers of renal cell injury or stress could play an important role. We evaluated the performance of the novel urinary cell-cycle arrest biomarker test [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in septic patients at high risk for developing AKI. We chose to assess risk of moderate to severe AKI because this severity (corresponding to KDIGO stage 2 and 3) has been shown to be associated with a significantly increased prevalence of clinically important outcomes such as receipt of RRT and in hospital death (35), as well as adverse effects on long-term survival specifically in patients with sepsis (1).Sepsis is a challenging area for AKI biomarkers. NGAL and IL-18 have been examined as potential biomarkers of AKI, but both are strongly influenced by systemic inflammation thus degrading their specificity (36, 37). Although a small study recently reported better performance of NGAL (both plasma and urine) for AKI in patients with sepsis (AUCs, 0.83 and 0.89) (38), most studies have noted modest performance of biomarkers in this population. Recently, a sophisticated machine-learning analysis was performed using candidate biomarkers selected from extensive transcriptomic analysis to predict AKI on day 3 in pediatric patients with sepsis (37). Even after including AKI status on day 1 in the model (positive in half the cases), the AUC only reached 0.83 in the test cohort (37). These challenges are perhaps not surprising because the mechanisms of organ injury in sepsis may not be organ specific (37). However, our results indicate that the performance of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in patients with sepsis is not significantly confounded by nonrenal SOFA. Thus, clinicians can rely on these biomarkers for predicting AKI even in the presence of nonrenal organ failures. This is a notable advance in comparison with other biomarkers that are available around the world (39–42).As alluded to in a recent study of remote ischemic preconditioning (43), biomarkers of cell-cycle arrest such as TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 may signal that the renal epithelium has been stressed and has shut down function but may still be able to recover without permanent injury to the organ. Importantly, both TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 appear to be able to signal in autocrine and paracrine fashions, thus spreading the ""alarm"" from the site of injury (15, 44). In terms of timing, this signal could be ideal as it may be early enough that management strategies can still alter the outcome. This is particularly important in septic AKI where delay and early timing remains a major issue (4, 32, 42).Although not directly examined in these observational trials, we hypothesize that early use of biomarkers of cell-cycle arrest such as TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 could help clinicians intervene early on and thus improve outcomes for patients at risk of or with early evidence of sepsis-induced AKI (45–47). Early awareness that a patient with sepsis is about to develop a major organ failure could change a number of clinical decisions. For example, selection of antibiotics and dosing/monitoring of nephrotoxic medication (antibiotics or others) would be affected. The decision to give intravenous radiocontrast (especially intra-arterial) could be altered. Even the decision to discharge a patient or commence with a detailed diagnostic work-up would be influenced by the probability that a patient has or will have AKI (48). For example, consider a patient with sepsis admitted from the medical ward and started on broad spectrum antibiotics including empiric coverage with vancomycin. The morning after admission (9 hr later), the blood pressure and heart rate were normalized and cultures were pending. Now imagine that creatinine level of the patient was slightly elevated (1.2 mg/dL from 1.0), but urine output was adequate. If the patient had a urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] test result more than 2.0, the risk of developing stage 2–3 AKI would be more than 50% and the patient's clinical team might well wish to stop or dose-adjust the vancomycin and perhaps keep the patient in the ICU where fluids, urine output, and hemodynamics can be monitored more carefully. Conversely, if the result were less than 0.3, then the risk would be less than 3% and thus the patient could be safely continued on current regimen.Of course, biomarkers will not take the place of clinical judgment and the question whether they offer information in addition to clinical variables is an important one. Although clinicians are unlikely to use statistical models at the bedside, the model shown in Table represents the limits of information that can be derived from clinical variables. Indeed, the model used here was developed in this dataset and is therefore likely overtrained. As such, it represents and unrealistic ""benchmark"" to compare the biomarker. Nevertheless, the markers show added value even in this setting. Recent work examining the role of electronic surveillance for AKI has shown that although computer programs can help identification of AKI, this alone may not improve patient outcomes. Indeed, electronic alerts may be ""too late"" because they are based on creatinine that is too late. Wilson et al (49) examined an electronic alert based on KDIGO stage 1 but could not demonstrate changes in physician practice or patient outcome. Physicians may already be aware of an AKI event and so do not change their management. Importantly, the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP-7] test was developed to assess risk for stage 2–3 AKI 12 hours prior to its clinical manifestation. This has two important potential benefits over the electronic alert. First, 12 hours is a long time in the ICU and could be a decisive period to discontinue nephrotoxins, investigate the source of sepsis, and improve resuscitation. Second, as many as 70% of AKI alerts will be for patients that never progress beyond stage 1 AKI. Alert fatigue is a large factor leading to clinicians ignoring alerts. The [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP-7] test was developed for stage 2–3 AKI, and thus it does not detect stage 1 conditions that are low risk for progression. Conversely, like all diagnostics, biomarkers for AKI should not be used in patient populations for which they were not developed. Low-risk patients (e.g., stable outpatients) will exhibit far greater false-positive rates compared with critically ill patients and would not be appropriate for the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP-7] test.Our study has important strengths. We analyzed data from two large and unrelated cohorts with two different methods of determining the AKI endpoint (KDIGO stage 2–3 and clinical adjudication). However, this could be viewed as limitation, and there are also other important limitations to this work. First, because the Sapphire and Topaz clinical trials were not specifically designed to examine sepsis-induced AKI, we did not collect information on the type of organism or on the timing of infection. Nonetheless, our results are consistent across both multicenter cohort studies. Second, long-term outcomes were not available or was quality of life assessed in the Topaz study. Third, and most importantly, we could not examine whether the availability of biomarker results would have changed patient management or outcomes. This question awaits further study. However, given the limited information in the literature about the performance of biomarkers in sepsis-induced AKI, despite its common occurrence, we believe that our results should inform clinical practice and future research.CONCLUSIONSThe urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] test provides accurate prediction of AKI in septic patients, and test performance is not affected by nonrenal organ dysfunction. As such, the test may extend the therapeutic window for renal protection and potentially enhance (future) therapeutic interventions to prevent or attenuate AKI.FootnotesDr. Shi had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

T1D Insulin Is Life Support,"*This post may contain affiliate links. If you choose to take action through one of my links I will receive compensation, at no extra cost to you. You can find my full Disclaimer at the bottom of this page. Thanks in advance, this is what helps support my family. ðŸ'œ Everybody needs insulin to survive. When you're a t1d insulin is life support. Injecting yourself with insulin is not a cure, it literally is life support. By giving yourself insulin, your keeping your body alive. That's what we're going to discuss in this article. We need to raise awareness and help others understand more about this disease. So, if your interested let's move on.T1DLet me just start off by saying that type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease. It's also considered an autoimmune disease. Type 1 diabetes is also referred to as t1d. That's a term I use a lot. I'm sure you've noticed.There are millions of people who suffer from this disease. Everyone knows the term diabetes. But, what most people refer to is type 2. This is the one that's most common. But, every day more and more people are becoming diagnosed with type 1.Now, type 1 used to be referred to as juvenile diabetes. Youmay have also heard of that term. That's because it used to be found more inchildren. But, it is not just a children's disease. Sadly, anyone can become a type1 diabetic at any time. It doesn't matter your age, weight, or race.If you don't know much about it, you can check out this post Understanding Type 1 Diabetes.Your Pancreas and InsulinNow, when you get t1d your pancreas quits working. This is a slow process. while there are symptoms, they usually happen too late. By the time you start to recognize these symptoms, your blood sugar has been out of control for a while. In the beginning, your pancreas will work sometimes, whenever it wants to. What your pancreas does is produce insulin for your body. Nothing like a pancreas that has a mind of its own. Your injecting insulin, then your pancreas decides to shoot out a little on its own. And BAM! You're low. But, over time, it will eventually quit working completely.What actually happens is that your body will attack your pancreas. That's what an autoimmune disease does. Your immune system is supposed to attack germs and ignore healthy cells. But, for some reason, it will mistakenly start to attack your good cells. And in this case, it destroys insulin-producing cells in your pancreas. Once this happens, it cannot be repaired. So, eventually, a t1d is just left with a useless pancreas.There is no known cause of this disease. No rhyme or reason. That's the thing, it just happens. It's irreversible and incurable. Even if you catch it early, they cannot stop it from happening. It's best to catch it early though, so you can start getting treatment. Diabetes left untreated can cause many serious issues.Now, here you are, left with a pancreas that won't produce insulin. You need insulin to break down the carbohydrates that you eat. It's what allows it to get from the bloodstream into your cells. And in turn, gives you the energy that we get from food. Now, a regular person may not even realize just how many carbs, or carbohydrates, that you eat in a day. I had never before paid attention to how many carbs I eat. Some people may, but some people don't. And let me tell you, it's a LOT.Insulin Is Life SupportNow your body cannot live without insulin. So, what do you do? Well, you have to inject it into your body. This is your only option. It's not a cure, insulin is life support for your body. You are left counting carbs and using needles to inject insulin into your body for survival. Every single time you eat anything with carbs, you need an injection. And there is only a handful of things that don't have carbs.You may be thinking well that sounds easy enough though. At least you can live. Now I do agree with the ""at least you can live"" part. I am so so grateful that they at least found a way for a t1d to survive. But, it's sooo not easy. Not easy at all. Now, I don't even have this disease, but my daughter and niece do. And let me tell you that it's just a life-changing thing to have to deal with. Plus, being a mom of a t1d has a ton of struggles of its own. Because while you can break it down and put into simple terms, there is nothing simple about it.Whether your a child or an adult dealing with this issue it's still a struggle. There is so many things that you have to learn just to try and manage. And it gets old dealing with these problems day after day. A t1d needs a lot of positive reinforcement. It's very easy to become depressed and want to just give up. They get tired of it. I mean imagine stabbing yourself with a needle countless times every single day of your life. Sometimes it's easy to forget everything they are dealing with and what's going on in their head. Check out this post on Dealing with newly diagnosed t1d.T1D TrainingWhen you become a diabetic, you have so much to learn. I had to go through days of training before my daughter could even leave the hospital. I will never forget sitting in that room and having that instructor tell us ""you no longer have a normal healthy child"". We now have a sick child who will have ever-changing challenges. But, it is manageable, and we just have to learn how to take care of her.Let me tell you though, I am extremely grateful for this training. Because, when my niece was diagnosed she wasn't taught much about it. Like I was. She was an adult when she found out. Now, I'm not sure if that was the reason or not. But, she really struggled to figure out exactly what she needed to do. Luckily, my daughter was diagnosed only 3 weeks after her, so we all kind of learned together. The instructors at Riley hospital even let her and my sister attend the training classes with me. They were awesome. So, like I said I'm not sure if this is the case for every adult diagnosed, but it's not a good thing. Every diabetic should be taught everything they need to know as soon as possible. It's important to know as much as you can about something so crucial, this can be life-threatening.Insulin Guessing GamesNow, one of the things you need to learn is how much insulin you need. You must check your blood several times a day. Especially when eating. You have to add more insulin if your blood sugar is higher than it should be. Everyone is different, so how much insulin you need will vary. It will vary anyway, you need to keep adjusting the amount you get. And many things can factor into this. So, it's a lifetime of insulin adjustment. It's a guessing game. At times you may be getting too much, other times not enough. Then factor in that your pancreas may just decide it wants to give you a little extra. And that's never good.And back to the blood checking. A diabetic will use a lancet, lancing device, and a meter to check their blood. The lancing device is what holds the lancet, or the needle, and injects it into your skin. Then, you need a meter and a test strip to put your blood on to find out your blood sugar. Now a normal range for my daughter is 70-150. Anything within that range is considered a good blood sugar. I know the range is different for smaller children, but I can't remember what it is right off hand. But, normal for a non-diabetic is below 100. When my daughter was diagnosed, her blood sugar was over 1000. We were very very lucky.Raising Awareness of T1DHigh blood sugar left untreated will cause serious issues. You can go into what's called ketoacidosis. This is also known as DKA. It's a very serious condition and can lead to coma or even death. As I said, we were very lucky. I didn't know the severity of this disease at the time. My niece wasn't taught much about it, and I knew nothing. That's the issue and one reason I am trying to help raise awareness. Because most of us don't know anything about it until we have to.But, I did know the symptoms because of my niece. And I did recognize them in my daughter. It was one of those things where I was noticing them, but I didn't want to admit it. She had lost weight, she was always thirsty. And I mean really thirsty, she could drink a 42-ounce fountain drink in no time. I finally faced the fact and had my niece check her blood.I just knew something was not right, and could almost guarantee she had the exact same thing as my niece. Too many symptoms added up. She wasn't feeling good and we needed to know. Well, when we checked it, the meter would not even read. It only goes up to 600. But, it just said HIGH, We made her go wash her hands and try again. It still said HIGH. So, of course, I freaked out, and we took her to the hospital. I eventually found out that it was over 1000.The bottom line is that I'm very thankful that I was capable of learning as much as I did about this disease. I wish it was under other circumstances, but that was the hand we were dealt. Now, we must face each day and the struggles that come with it, and make it the best that we can. All we can do is help make others aware and pray for a cure.Follow me on your favorite social mediaLike this:Like Loading...Related",https://t.co/zW8NaKn40h,others
Soaring insulin prices cause Minn. lawmakers to draft remedies,"A group of state legislators said Tuesday that it is considering regulations — even price controls — to rein in the soaring cost of insulin, which has crimped the budgets of thousands of Minnesota families and caused some diabetics to ration the medication. With more than 460,000 diabetics in Minnesota, legislators say they are hearing many complaints from frustrated and worried constituents. Rationing insulin can lead to illness, even death. Sen. Matt Little, DFL-Lakeville, convened a roundtable discussion at the State Capitol, which included several senators, two incoming House members and several patients and parents of children with diabetes. ""Something needs to change,"" said Alexis Stanley, a college student who was diagnosed with diabetes this year, just two months after her 19th birthday. Stanley said her mother recently turned down a job because its health insurance wasn't as good as in her current job. That has Stanley concerned about how she'll pay for insulin in the future. ""I'm scared to turn 26 and get off my parents' insurance,"" she said. The price of insulin has more than tripled since 2002. Last October, Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson filed a lawsuit against the three big insulin manufacturers, alleging that they committed deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud to inflate prices. The drugmakers denied the allegations. A vial of insulin can cost between $300 and $400, and the more convenient insulin pens can cost nearly $700 for a box of five, with some patients using one box every week. But many diabetics pay different prices based on their insurance coverage, as well as co-payments and deductibles. ""We spend more time struggling with insurance companies and struggling with pharmacies,"" said Lija Greenseid of St. Paul, whose 12-year-old daughter is diabetic. Two years ago Greenseid learned just how much cheaper insulin is in other countries when her family traveled internationally. A box of insulin pens, for example, cost just $40 in Taiwan, $65 in Canada, $50 in Greece and $61 in Italy, she said. They saved so much money on insulin that it helped finance the trip. ""The cost of insulin is immorally high,"" Little said. ""There appears to be no rational reason why the costs increased so much."" Several states have considered bills that would require pharmaceutical companies to be more transparent about prices, including requiring them to justify higher prices. Little said he would push for that but that the situation requires a more ""aggressive"" approach. ""You'd have to work through the constitutional concerns, but Minnesota could set the price for what it could be sold for here in Minnesota,"" he said. A spokesman for PhRMA, the industry trade group, said Tuesday that consumers are paying higher prices because insurers and pharmacy benefit managers aren't passing along discounts and rebates. ""We believe tasking the government with setting prices isn't the right solution and would be harmful to innovation and patients' access,"" said Nick McGee, PhRMA director of public affairs. ""Instead, insurers should share more of the discounts they receive directly with patients."" Controlling drug prices is not a new topic in the Legislature. Last session, Sen. Scott Jensen, R-Chaska, introduced a bill that would have created a drug cost review commission with the power to review drug price increases and set lower prices. However, the bill did not get a committee hearing. Another bill being considered would provide free or low cost insulin to diabetics who can't afford the drug. Incoming House member Mike Howard, DFL-Richfield, said he would introduce legislation to make insulin available at neighborhood pharmacies to those who can't afford the drug. Howard said details are still being worked out, but he hopes to have pharmaceutical companies pay for part of the program costs. His bill echoes one introduced but not passed last session. Bill sponsor Rep. Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, named the legislation in honor of Alec Smith, who died in 2017 at the age of 26 after rationing his insulin. Both of Smith's parents addressed the roundtable Tuesday morning. ""Health care in America is in the middle of a crisis. We have to make some major changes to protect the lives of our loved ones,"" said Smith's father, James Holt Jr.",https://t.co/SRYjHQGO5C,others
How Do They Work?,"Insulin and glucagon are hormones that help regulate the levels of blood glucose, or sugar, in your body. Glucose, which comes from the food you eat, moves through your bloodstream to help fuel your body. Insulin and glucagon work together to balance your blood sugar levels, keeping them in the narrow range that your body requires. These hormones are like the yin and yang of blood glucose maintenance. Read on to learn more about how they function and what can happen when they don't work well.Insulin and glucagon work in what's called a negative feedback loop. During this process, one event triggers another, which triggers another, and so on, to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. How insulin works During digestion, foods that contain carbohydrates are converted into glucose. Most of this glucose is sent into your bloodstream, causing a rise in blood glucose levels. This increase in blood glucose signals your pancreas to produce insulin. The insulin tells cells throughout your body to take in glucose from your bloodstream. As the glucose moves into your cells, your blood glucose levels go down. Some cells use the glucose as energy. Other cells, such as in your liver and muscles, store any excess glucose as a substance called glycogen. Your body uses glycogen for fuel between meals. Read more: Simple vs. complex carbs »How glucagon works Glucagon works to counterbalance the actions of insulin.About four to six hours after you eat, the glucose levels in your blood decrease, triggering your pancreas to produce glucagon. This hormone signals your liver and muscle cells to change the stored glycogen back into glucose. These cells then release the glucose into your bloodstream so your other cells can use it for energy. This whole feedback loop with insulin and glucagon is constantly in motion. It keeps your blood sugar levels from dipping too low, ensuring that your body has a steady supply of energy.Your body's regulation of blood glucose is an amazing metabolic feat. However, for some people, the process doesn't work properly. Diabetes mellitus is the best known condition that causes problems with blood sugar balance. Diabetes refers to a group of diseases. If you have diabetes or prediabetes, your body's use or production of insulin and glucagon are off. And when the system is thrown out of balance, it can lead to dangerous levels of glucose in your blood.Type 1 diabetesOf the two main types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes is the less common form. It's thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system destroys the cells that make insulin in your pancreas. If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas doesn't produce insulin. As a result, you must take insulin every day. If you don't, you'll get very sick or you could die. For more information, read about the complications of type 1 diabetes.Learn more: Everything you need to know about insulin »Type 2 diabetesWith type 2 diabetes, your body makes insulin but your cells don't respond to it normally. They don't take in glucose from your bloodstream as well as they once did, which leads to higher blood sugar levels. Over time, type 2 diabetes makes your body produce less insulin, which further raises your blood sugar levels. Gestational diabetesSome women develop gestational diabetes late in their pregnancies. In gestational diabetes, pregnancy-related hormones may interfere with how insulin works. This condition normally disappears after the pregnancy ends. However, if you've had gestational diabetes, you're at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future.PrediabetesIf you have prediabetes, your body makes insulin but doesn't use it properly. As a result, your blood glucose levels are raised, though not as high as they would be if you had type 2 diabetes. Many people who have prediabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes. Knowing how your body works can help you stay healthy. Insulin and glucagon are two critical hormones your body makes to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. It's helpful to understand how these hormones function so you can work to avoid diabetes. If you have more questions about insulin, glucagon, and blood glucose, talk to your doctor. Questions you have might include:Is my blood glucose at a safe level?Do I have prediabetes?What can I do to avoid developing diabetes?How do I know if I need to take insulin?",https://t.co/DnV7AxLU30,others
John Macleod - Biographical - NobelPrize.org,"John James Rickard Macleod was born on September 6, 1876 at Cluny, near Dunkeld, Perthshire, Scotland. He was the son of the Rev. Robert Macleod. When later the family moved to Aberdeen, Macleod went to the Grammar School there and later entered the Marischal College of the University of Aberdeen to study medicine. In 1898 he took his medical degree with honours and was awarded the Anderson Travelling Fellowship, which enabled him to work for a year at the Institute for Physiology at the University of Leipzig. In 1899 he was appointed Demonstrator of Physiology at the London Hospital Medical School under Professor Leonard Hill and in 1902 he was appointed Lecturer in Biochemistry at the same College. In that year he was awarded the McKinnon Research Studentship of the Royal Society, which he held until 1903, when he was appointed Professor of Physiology at the Western Reserve University at Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A. During his tenure of this post he was occupied by various war duties and acted, for part of the winter session of 1916, as Professor of Physiology at McGill University, Montreal. In 1918 he was elected Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto, Canada. Here he was Director of the Physiological Laboratory and Associate Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. In 1928 he was appointed Regius Professor of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen, a post which he held, together with that of Consultant Physiologist to the Rowett Institute for Animal Nutrition, in spite of failing health, until his early death. Macleod's name will always be associated with his work on carbohydrate metabolism and especially with his collaboration with Frederick Banting and Charles Best in the discovery of insulin. For this work on the discovery of insulin, in 1921, Banting and Macleod were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for 1923. Macleod had, before this discovery, been interested in carbohydrate metabolism and especially in diabetes since 1905 and he had published some 37 papers on carbohydrate metabolism and 12 papers on experimentally produced glycosuria. Previously he had followed the earlier great work of von Mering and Minkowski, which has been published in 1889, and although he believed that the pancreas was the organ involved, he had not been able to prove exactly what part it played. Although Laguesse had suggested, in 1893, that the islets of Langerhans possibly produced an internal secretion which controlled the metabolism of sugar, and Sharpey-Schafer had, in 1916, called this hypothetical substance ""insuline"", nobody had been able to prove its actual existence. Others had made extracts of the pancreas, some of which had proved to be active in affecting the metabolism of sugar, but none of these products had been found reliable, until Banting and Best, jointly with Macleod, could announce their great discovery in February 1922. The process of manufacturing the pancreatic extract which could be used for the treatment of human patients was patented; the financial proceeds of the patent were given to the British Medical Research Council for the Encouragement of Research, the discoverers receiving no payment at all. Subsequently, the active principle of these earlier pancreatic extracts, insulin, was isolated in pure form by John Jacob Abel in 1926, and eventually it became available as a manufactured product. Earlier, in 1908, Macleod had done experimental work on the possible part played by the central nervous system in the causation of hyperglycaemia and in 1932 he returned to this subject, basing his work on the experiments done by Claude Bernard on puncture diabetes, and Macleod then concluded, from experiments done on rabbits, that stimulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver occurred by way of the parasympathetic nervous system. Macleod also did much work in fields other than carbohydrate metabolism. His first paper, published in 1899, when he was working at the London Hospital, had been on the phosphorus content of muscle and he also worked on air sickness, electric shock, purine bases, the chemistry of the tubercle bacillus and the carbamates. In addition he wrote 11 books and monographs, among which were his Recent Advances in Physiology (with Sir Leonard Hill) (1905); Physiology and Biochemistry of Modern Medicine, which had reached its 9th edition in 1941; Diabetes: its Pathological Physiology (1925); Carbohydrate Metabolism and Insulin (1926); and his Vanuxem lectures, published in 1928 as the Fuel of Life. In 1919 Macleod was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, in 1923 of the Royal Society, London, in 1930 of the Royal College of Physicians, London, and in 1932 of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. During 1921-1923 he was President of the American Physiological Society, and during 1925-1926 of the Royal Canadian Institute. He held honorary doctorates of the Universities of Toronto, Cambridge, Aberdeen and Pennsylvania, the Western Reserve University and the Jefferson Medical College. He was an honorary fellow of the Accademia Medica, Rome, and also a corresponding member of the Medical and Surgical Society, Bologna, the Societá Medica Chirurgica, Rome, and the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Halle, and Foreign Associate Fellow of the College of Physicians, Philadelphia. Macleod was a very successful teacher and director of research. His lucid lectures were delivered in an attractive manner and his pupils and research associates found him a sympathetic and stimulating worker, who demanded exact work and the humility that was a feature of his character. He would not tolerate careless work. He was much interested in the development of medical education and especially in the introduction of scientific methods of investigation into clinical work. Outside the laboratory he was keenly interested in golf and gardening and the arts, especially painting. A sensitive, loyal and affectionate man of engaging personality, his serene spirit met with courage and optimism the painful and crippling disabilities which troubled the final years of his busy life. Macleod was married to Mary McWalter. He died on March 16, 1935.

Most common health problems, diseases, and symptoms are directly caused by insulin resistance, yet are treating every single one of these conditions with a separate drug. Insulin resistance is when the cells are rejecting insulin. This is caused by chronic exposure to insulin. Insulin resistance is a combination of insulin deficiency and a massive spike of insulin in certain other parts of the body. Insulin Resistance Health-Related Conditions- Metabolic syndrome - High blood pressure- High cholesterol - Belly fat - Fatty liver - Diabetes (kidney damage, peripheral neuropathy, neurological problems, eye problems)- Heart problems (clot, plaque, arrhythmias, cholesterol, high blood pressure)- Inflammation (joint, autoimmune, artery, digestive/cirrhosis)- Brain (Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's, cognitive, seizures)- PCOS (High androgen)- Decreased testosterone - Pre-diabetes- Cancer - Obesity â€"" Insulin is the main fat-storing hormone.Causes of High Levels of Insulin - High-carbohydrate diets- Chronic eating or frequent eating - Cortisol (stress hormone)Eric Berg, DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 53 years of age, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.

Insulin Resistance Test (Best Test for IR & Stubborn Weight Loss) Homa-IR,"Insulin Resistance Test (Best Test for IR &amp; Stubborn Weight Loss) Homa-IR. Insulin resistance is linked to the majority of modern diseases: obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease. If you are overweight you probably have an insulin resistance issue even if your blood glucose and A1c levels are normal. By finding out your insulin levels you can see if your body is insulin resistant or insulin sensitive. If you are insulin resistant it is possible that you will become a diabetic. Learn more about the Homa-IR test and what Insulin resistance means in this video. Dr. Ekberg answers the question why do I have insulin resistance but normal A1c or normal glucose? When you don't see a high A1c or glucose level it is considered sub-clinical. Later, if nothing is done, it will progress to clinical and then a disease. In some cases, it takes 10 years for insulin resistance to turn into diabetes, so it is best to understand what is going on so you can do something now to prevent diabetes. The best test to identify insulin resistance is a fasting insulin test, which is different than a fasting glucose test or an A1c test.ğŸ""´ LEARN TO MASTER YOUR HEALTH BY SUBSCRIBINGhttp://www.youtube.com/DrEkberg?sub_c...ğŸ""´ SHARE THIS VIDEO WITH SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT:https://youtu.be/S8cJPtud2tYâ–¶ï¸� OTHER VIDEOS ON WEIGHT LOSS, KETO, LOW CARB, NATURAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS YOU MIGHT LIKE:* Intermittent Fasting - https://youtu.be/jetiN8xAKiQ* Ketogenic Diet - https://youtu.be/ykPdkd5ALGc* High Blood Sugar - https://youtu.be/Ea4du9Cuwq0* Feeling Cold? - https://youtu.be/IYKFP9MUiGk* Thyroid Problems - https://youtu.be/tbs9IHN0DK4* High Blood Pressure - https://youtu.be/YRUhyQsZh9s* Posture &amp; Health - https://youtu.be/0o8udI2yGaM* Why Eating Healthy Is So Expensive In America - https://youtu.be/JOh_bFqVPUMğŸ""´ HELP WITH TRANSLATIONS:If you enjoyed this video help others enjoy it by adding captions in your native language - http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_vide...ğŸŒ¿ This is a Health Channel that focuses on all aspects of Natural Health and Wellness featuring Olympic decathlete and holistic doctor, Dr. Sten Ekberg with Wellness For Life.

It is therefore an anabolic hormone, promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells. Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism, especially of reserve body fat.Beta cells are sensitive to glucose concentrations, also known as blood sugar levels. When the glucose level is high, the beta cells secrete insulin into the blood; when glucose levels are low, secretion of insulin is inhibited.[8] Their neighboring alpha cells, by taking their cues from the beta cells,[8] secrete glucagon into the blood in the opposite manner: increased secretion when blood glucose is low, and decreased secretion when glucose concentrations are high.[6][8] Glucagon, through stimulating the liver to release glucose by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, has the opposite effect of insulin.[6][8] The secretion of insulin and glucagon into the blood in response to the blood glucose concentration is the primary mechanism of glucose homeostasis.[8]If beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmune reaction, insulin can no longer be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. This results in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations, and generalized body wasting.[9] In type 2 diabetes mellitus the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead there is an accumulation of amyloid in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology.[8] The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but patients exhibit a reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive, and peripheral tissue insulin resistance.[5] Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high rates of glucagon secretion into the blood which are unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of glucose in the blood. Insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose.[8] As a result, the insulin levels, even when the blood sugar level is normal, are much higher than they are in healthy persons.The human insulin protein is composed of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by disulfide bonds. Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in carbohydrate metabolism effects) from human insulin because of these variations. Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by recombinant DNA technologies.[10][11][12][13]The crystal structure of insulin in the solid state was determined by Dorothy Hodgkin. It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[14]Evolution and species distribution[edit]Insulin may have originated more than a billion years ago.[15] The molecular origins of insulin go at least as far back as the simplest unicellular eukaryotes.[16] Apart from animals, insulin-like proteins are also known to exist in the Fungi and Protista kingdoms.[15]Insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets in most vertebrates and by the Brockmann body in some teleost fish.[17] Cone snails Conus geographus and Conus tulipa, venomous sea snails that hunt small fish, use modified forms of insulin in their venom cocktails. The insulin toxin, closer in structure to fishes' than to snails' native insulin, slows down the prey fishes by lowering their blood glucose levels.[18][19]The preproinsulin precursor of insulin is encoded by the INS gene.[20][21]Alleles[edit]A variety of mutant alleles with changes in the coding region have been identified. A read-through gene, INS-IGF2, overlaps with this gene at the 5' region and with the IGF2 gene at the 3' region.[20]Regulation[edit] Diagram of insulin regulation upon high blood glucoseIn the pancreatic β cells, glucose is the primary physiological stimulus for the regulation of insulin synthesis. Insulin is mainly regulated through the transcription factors PDX1, NeuroD1, and MafA.[22][23][24][25]PDX1 (Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox protein 1) is in the nuclear periphery upon low blood glucose levels[26] interacting with corepressors HDAC1 and 2 which is downregulating the insulin secretion.[27] An increase in blood glucose levels causes phosphorylation of PDX1 and it translocates centrally and binds the A3 element within the insulin promoter.[28] Upon translocation it interacts with coactivators HAT p300 and acetyltransferase set 7/9. PDX1 affects the histone modifications through acetylation and deacetylation as well as methylation. It is also said to suppress glucagon.[29]NeuroD1, also known as β2, regulates insulin exocytosis in pancreatic β cells by directly inducing the expression of genes involved in exocytosis.[30] It is localized in the cytosol, but in response to high glucose it becomes glycosylated by OGT and/or phosphorylated by ERK, which causes translocation to the nucleus. In the nucleus β2 heterodimerizes with E47, binds to the E1 element of the insulin promoter and recruits co-activator p300 which acetylates β2. It is able to interact with other transcription factors as well in activation of the insulin gene.[30]MafA is degraded by proteasomes upon low blood glucose levels. Increased levels of glucose make an unknown protein glycosylated. This protein works as a transcription factor for MafA in an unknown manner and MafA is transported out of the cell. MafA is then translocated back into the nucleus where it binds the C1 element of the insulin promoter.[31][32]These transcription factors work synergistically and in a complex arrangement. Increased blood glucose can after a while destroy the binding capacities of these proteins, and therefore reduce the amount of insulin secreted, causing diabetes. The decreased binding activities can be mediated by glucose induced oxidative stress and antioxidants are said to prevent the decreased insulin secretion in glucotoxic pancreatic β cells. Stress signalling molecules and reactive oxygen species inhibits the insulin gene by interfering with the cofactors binding the transcription factors and the transcription factors it self.[33]Several regulatory sequences in the promoter region of the human insulin gene bind to transcription factors. In general, the A-boxes bind to Pdx1 factors, E-boxes bind to NeuroD, C-boxes bind to MafA, and cAMP response elements to CREB. There are also silencers that inhibit transcription.Structure[edit]Within vertebrates, the amino acid sequence of insulin is strongly conserved. The molecular formula of human insulin is C257H383N65O77S6.[36] Bovine insulin differs from human in only three amino acid residues, and porcine insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of proinsulin (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one. SS-linked insulin monomerThe primary structure of bovine insulin was first determined by Frederick Sanger in 1951.[37] After that, this polypeptide was synthesized independently by several groups.[38][39][40] The 3-dimensional structure of insulin was determined by X-ray crystallography in Dorothy Hodgkin's laboratory in 1969 (PDB file 1ins).[41]Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules.[42] Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta-sheets. This can cause injection amyloidosis, and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods.[43]Synthesis, physiological effects, and degradation[edit]Synthesis[edit]Insulin is produced in the pancreas and the Brockmann body (in some fish), and released when any of several stimuli are detected. These stimuli include the rise in plasma concentrations of amino acids and glucose resulting from the digestion of food.[44] Carbohydrates can be polymers of simple sugars or the simple sugars themselves. If the carbohydrates include glucose, then that glucose will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood glucose level will begin to rise. In target cells, insulin initiates a signal transduction, which has the effect of increasing glucose uptake and storage. Finally, insulin is degraded, terminating the response. Insulin undergoes extensive posttranslational modification along the production pathway. Production and secretion are largely independent; prepared insulin is stored awaiting secretion. Both C-peptide and mature insulin are biologically active. Cell components and proteins in this image are not to scale.In mammals, insulin is synthesized in the pancreas within the beta cells. One million to three million pancreatic islets form the endocrine part of the pancreas, which is primarily an exocrine gland. The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the pancreatic islets, beta cells constitute 65–80% of all the cells.Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, the A- and B- chains, linked together by disulfide bonds. It is however first synthesized as a single polypeptide called preproinsulin in beta cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue signal peptide which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming proinsulin.[45] In the RER the proinsulin folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed. About 5–10 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, proinsulin is transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where immature granules are formed. Transport to the TGN may take about 30 min.Proinsulin undergoes maturation into active insulin through the action of cellular endopeptidases known as prohormone convertases (PC1 and PC2), as well as the exoprotease carboxypeptidase E.[46] The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions, releasing a fragment called the C-peptide, and leaving 2 peptide chains, the B- and A- chains, linked by 2 disulfide bonds. The cleavage sites are each located after a pair of basic residues (lysine-64 and arginine-65, and arginine-31 and −32). After cleavage of the C-peptide, these 2 pairs of basic residues are removed by the carboxypeptidase.[47] The C-peptide is the central portion of proinsulin, and the primary sequence of proinsulin goes in the order ""B-C-A"" (the B and A chains were identified on the basis of mass and the C-peptide was discovered later).The resulting mature insulin is packaged inside mature granules waiting for metabolic signals (such as leucine, arginine, glucose and mannose) and vagal nerve stimulation to be exocytosed from the cell into the circulation.[48]The endogenous production of insulin is regulated in several steps along the synthesis pathway:Insulin and its related proteins have been shown to be produced inside the brain, and reduced levels of these proteins are linked to Alzheimer's disease.[49][50][51]Insulin release is stimulated also by beta-2 receptor stimulation and inhibited by alpha-1 receptor stimulation. In addition, cortisol, glucagon and growth hormone antagonize the actions of insulin during times of stress. Insulin also inhibits fatty acid release by hormone sensitive lipase in adipose tissue.[6]Release[edit]Beta cells in the islets of Langerhans release insulin in two phases. The first-phase release is rapidly triggered in response to increased blood glucose levels, and lasts about 10 minutes. The second phase is a sustained, slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar, peaking in 2 to 3 hours. Reduced first-phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable beta cell defect predicting onset of type 2 diabetes.[52] First-phase release and insulin sensitivity are independent predictors of diabetes.[53]The description of first phase release is as follows:Glucose enters the β-cells through the glucose transporters, GLUT2. These glucose transporters have a relatively low affinity for glucose, ensuring that the rate of glucose entry into the β-cells is proportional to the extracellular glucose concentration (within the physiological range). At low blood sugar levels very little glucose enters the β-cells; at high blood glucose concentrations large quantities of glucose enter these cells.[54]The glucose that enters the β-cell is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by glucokinase (hexokinase IV) which is not inhibited by G-6-P in the way that the hexokinases in other tissues (hexokinase I – III) are affected by this product. This means that the intracellular G-6-P concentration remains proportional to the blood sugar concentration.[8][54]Glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolytic pathway and then, via the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, into the Krebs cycle, where multiple, high-energy ATP molecules are produced by the oxidation of acetyl CoA (the Krebs cycle substrate), leading to a rise in the ATP:ADP ratio within the cell.[55]An increased intracellular ATP:ADP ratio closes the ATP-sensitive SUR1/Kir6.2 potassium channel (see sulfonylurea receptor). This prevents potassium ions (K+) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion, leading to a buildup of intracellular potassium ions. As a result, the inside of the cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside, leading to the depolarization of the cell surface membrane.Upon depolarization, voltage-gated calcium ion (Ca2+) channels open, allowing calcium ions to move into the cell by facilitated diffusion.The cytosolic calcium ion concentration can also be increased by calcium release from intracellular stores via activation of ryanodine receptors.[56]The calcium ion concentration in the cytosol of the beta cells can also, or additionally, be increased through the activation of phospholipase C resulting from the binding of an extracellular ligand (hormone or neurotransmitter) to a G protein-coupled membrane receptor. Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) then binds to receptor proteins in the plasma membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This allows the release of Ca2+ ions from the ER via IP3-gated channels, which raises the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions independently of the effects of a high blood glucose concentration. Parasympathetic stimulation of the pancreatic islets operates via this pathway to increase insulin secretion into the blood.[57]The significantly increased amount of calcium ions in the cells' cytoplasm causes the release into the blood of previously synthesized insulin, which has been stored in intracellular secretory vesicles.This is the primary mechanism for release of insulin. Other substances known to stimulate insulin release include the amino acids arginine and leucine, parasympathetic release of acetylcholine (acting via the phospholipase C pathway), sulfonylurea, cholecystokinin (CCK, also via phospholipase C),[58] and the gastrointestinally derived incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP).Release of insulin is strongly inhibited by norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which leads to increased blood glucose levels during stress. It appears that release of catecholamines by the sympathetic nervous system has conflicting influences on insulin release by beta cells, because insulin release is inhibited by α2-adrenergic receptors[59] and stimulated by β2-adrenergic receptors.[60] The net effect of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves and epinephrine from adrenal glands on insulin release is inhibition due to dominance of the α-adrenergic receptors.[61]When the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently glucagon from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by gluconeogenesis if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.Evidence of impaired first-phase insulin release can be seen in the glucose tolerance test, demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a glucose load (75 or 100 g of glucose), followed by a slow drop over the next 100 minutes, to remain above 120 mg/100 ml after two hours after the start of the test. In a normal person the blood glucose level is corrected (and may even be slightly over-corrected) by the end of the test.Oscillations[edit] Insulin release from pancreas oscillates with a period of 3–6 minutes.[62]Even during digestion, in general, one or two hours following a meal, insulin release from the pancreas is not continuous, but oscillates with a period of 3–6 minutes, changing from generating a blood insulin concentration more than about 800 p mol/l to less than 100 pmol/l.[62] This is thought to avoid downregulation of insulin receptors in target cells, and to assist the liver in extracting insulin from the blood.[62] This oscillation is important to consider when administering insulin-stimulating medication, since it is the oscillating blood concentration of insulin release, which should, ideally, be achieved, not a constant high concentration.[62] This may be achieved by delivering insulin rhythmically to the portal vein or by islet cell transplantation to the liver.[62]Blood insulin level[edit] The idealized diagram shows the fluctuation of blood sugar (red) and the sugar-lowering hormone insulin (blue) in humans during the course of a day containing three meals. In addition, the effect of a sugar-rich versus a starch-rich meal is highlighted.The blood insulin level can be measured in international units, such as µIU/mL or in molar concentration, such as pmol/L, where 1 µIU/mL equals 6.945 pmol/L.[63] A typical blood level between meals is 8–11 μIU/mL (57–79 pmol/L).[64]Signal transduction[edit]The effects of insulin are initiated by its binding to a receptor present in the cell membrane. The receptor molecule contains an α- and β subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the α-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.[65]The cascade that leads to the insertion of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the cell membranes of muscle and fat cells, and to the synthesis of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue, as well as the conversion of glucose into triglycerides in liver, adipose, and lactating mammary gland tissue, operates via the activation, by IRS-1, of phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K). This enzyme converts a phospholipid in the cell membrane by the name of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which, in turn, activates protein kinase B (PKB). Activated PKB facilitates the fusion of GLUT4 containing endosomes with the cell membrane, resulting in an increase in GLUT4 transporters in the plasma membrane.[66] PKB also phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase (GSK), thereby inactivating this enzyme.[67] This means that its substrate, glycogen synthase (GS), cannot be phosphorylated, and remains dephosphorylated, and therefore active. The active enzyme, glycogen synthase (GS), catalyzes the rate limiting step in the synthesis of glycogen from glucose. Similar dephosphorylations affect the enzymes controlling the rate of glycolysis leading to the synthesis of fats via malonyl-CoA in the tissues that can generate triglycerides, and also the enzymes that control the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver. The overall effect of these final enzyme dephosphorylations is that, in the tissues that can carry out these reactions, glycogen and fat synthesis from glucose are stimulated, and glucose production by the liver through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are inhibited.[68] The breakdown of triglycerides by adipose tissue into free fatty acids and glycerol is also inhibited.[68]After the intracellular signal that resulted from the binding of insulin to its receptor has been produced, termination of signaling is then needed. As mentioned below in the section on degradation, endocytosis and degradation of the receptor bound to insulin is a main mechanism to end signaling.[48] In addition, the signaling pathway is also terminated by dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the various signaling pathways by tyrosine phosphatases. Serine/Threonine kinases are also known to reduce the activity of insulin.The structure of the insulin–insulin receptor complex has been determined using the techniques of X-ray crystallography.[69]Physiological effects[edit] Effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism. Insulin binds to its receptor (1), which starts many protein activation cascades (2). These include translocation of Glut-4 transporter to the plasma membrane and influx of glucose (3), glycogen synthesis (4), glycolysis (5) and triglyceride synthesis (6). The insulin signal transduction pathway begins when insulin binds to the insulin receptor proteins. Once the transduction pathway is completed, the GLUT-4 storage vesicles becomes one with the cellular membrane. As a result, the GLUT-4 protein channels become embedded into the membrane, allowing glucose to be transported into the cell.The actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include:The actions of insulin (indirect and direct) on cells include:Stimulates the uptake of glucose – Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration by inducing intake of glucose by the cells. This is possible because Insulin causes the insertion of the GLUT4 transporter in the cell membranes of muscle and fat tissues which allows glucose to enter the cell.[65]Increased fat synthesis – insulin forces fat cells to take in blood glucose, which is converted into triglycerides; decrease of insulin causes the reverse.[70]Increased esterification of fatty acids – forces adipose tissue to make neutral fats (i.e., triglycerides) from fatty acids; decrease of insulin causes the reverse.[70]Decreased lipolysis – forces reduction in conversion of fat cell lipid stores into blood fatty acids and glycerol; decrease of insulin causes the reverse.[70]Induce glycogen synthesis – When glucose levels are high, insulin induces the formation of glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a phosphate group in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key for the formation of glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.[71]Decreased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis – decreases production of glucose from noncarbohydrate substrates, primarily in the liver (the vast majority of endogenous insulin arriving at the liver never leaves the liver); increase of insulin causes glucose production by the liver from assorted substrates.[70]Decreased proteolysis – decreasing the breakdown of protein[70]Decreased autophagy – decreased level of degradation of damaged organelles. Postprandial levels inhibit autophagy completely.[72]Increased amino acid uptake – forces cells to absorb circulating amino acids; decrease of insulin inhibits absorption.[70]Arterial muscle tone – forces arterial wall muscle to relax, increasing blood flow, especially in microarteries; decrease of insulin reduces flow by allowing these muscles to contract.[73]Increase in the secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells in the stomach.[citation needed]Increased potassium uptake – forces cells synthesizing glycogen (a very spongy, ""wet"" substance, that increases the content of intracellular water, and its accompanying K+ ions)[74] to absorb potassium from the extracellular fluids; lack of insulin inhibits absorption. Insulin's increase in cellular potassium uptake lowers potassium levels in blood plasma. This possibly occurs via insulin-induced translocation of the Na+/K+-ATPase to the surface of skeletal muscle cells.[75][76]Decreased renal sodium excretion.[77]Insulin also influences other body functions, such as vascular compliance and cognition. Once insulin enters the human brain, it enhances learning and memory and benefits verbal memory in particular.[78] Enhancing brain insulin signaling by means of intranasal insulin administration also enhances the acute thermoregulatory and glucoregulatory response to food intake, suggesting that central nervous insulin contributes to the co-ordination of a wide variety of homeostatic or regulatory processes in the human body.[79] Insulin also has stimulatory effects on gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, thus favoring fertility.[80]Degradation[edit]Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell. The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney. The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of insulin-degrading enzyme. An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (insulin half-life ~ 4–6 minutes).[81][82]Regulator of endocannabinoid metabolism[edit]Insulin is a major regulator of endocannabinoid (EC) metabolism and insulin treatment has been shown to reduce intracellular ECs, the 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant adipocytes, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed in a manner consistent with elevated EC synthesis and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that insulin-resistant adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby obese insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs.[83][84] This dysregulation contributes to excessive visceral fat accumulation and reduced adiponectin release from abdominal adipose tissue, and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.[85]Hypoglycemia[edit]Hypoglycemia, also known as ""low blood sugar"", is when blood sugar decreases to below normal levels.[86] This may result in a variety of symptoms including clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures or death.[86] A feeling of hunger, sweating, shakiness and weakness may also be present.[86] Symptoms typically come on quickly.[86]The most common cause of hypoglycemia is medications used to treat diabetes mellitus such as insulin and sulfonylureas.[87][88] Risk is greater in diabetics who have eaten less than usual, exercised more than usual or have drunk alcohol.[86] Other causes of hypoglycemia include kidney failure, certain tumors, such as insulinoma, liver disease, hypothyroidism, starvation, inborn error of metabolism, severe infections, reactive hypoglycemia and a number of drugs including alcohol.[86][88] Low blood sugar may occur in otherwise healthy babies who have not eaten for a few hours.[89]Diseases and syndromes[edit]There are several conditions in which insulin disturbance is pathologic:Diabetes mellitus – general term referring to all states characterized by hyperglycemiaType 1 – autoimmune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, resulting in absolute insulin deficiencyType 2 – either inadequate insulin production by the β-cells or insulin resistance or both because of reasons not completely understood.there is correlation with diet, with sedentary lifestyle, with obesity, with age and with metabolic syndrome. Causality has been demonstrated in multiple model organisms including mice and monkeys; importantly, non-obese people do get Type 2 diabetes due to diet, sedentary lifestyle and unknown risk factors.it is likely that there is genetic susceptibility to develop Type 2 diabetes under certain environmental conditionsOther types of impaired glucose tolerance (see the Diabetes)Insulinoma – a tumor of beta cells producing excess insulin or reactive hypoglycemia.Metabolic syndrome – a poorly understood condition first called Syndrome X by Gerald Reaven. It is currently not clear whether the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for insulin response in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) to develop.Polycystic ovary syndrome – a complex syndrome in women in the reproductive years where anovulation and androgen excess are commonly displayed as hirsutism. In many cases of PCOS, insulin resistance is present.Medical uses[edit] A vial of insulin. It has been given a trade name, Actrapid, by the manufacturer.Biosynthetic human insulin (insulin human rDNA, INN) for clinical use is manufactured by recombinant DNA technology.[10] Biosynthetic human insulin has increased purity when compared with extractive animal insulin, enhanced purity reducing antibody formation. Researchers have succeeded in introducing the gene for human insulin into plants as another method of producing insulin (""biopharming"") in safflower.[90] This technique is anticipated to reduce production costs.Several analogs of human insulin are available. These insulin analogs are closely related to the human insulin structure, and were developed for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins).[91] The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), Humalog (insulin lispro),[citation needed] it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15 minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24 hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristic acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.Insulin is usually taken as subcutaneous injections by single-use syringes with needles, via an insulin pump, or by repeated-use insulin pens with disposable needles. Inhaled insulin is also available in the U.S. market now.Synthetic insulin can trigger adverse effects, so some people with diabetes rely on animal-source insulin.[92]Unlike many medicines, insulin currently cannot be taken orally because, like nearly all other proteins introduced into the gastrointestinal tract, it is reduced to fragments, whereupon all activity is lost. There has been some research into ways to protect insulin from the digestive tract, so that it can be administered orally or sublingually.[93][94]History of study[edit]Discovery[edit]In 1869, while studying the structure of the pancreas under a microscope, Paul Langerhans, a medical student in Berlin, identified some previously unnoticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas.[95] The function of the ""little heaps of cells"", later known as the islets of Langerhans, initially remained unknown, but Édouard Laguesse later suggested they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion.[96] Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role. The term ""insulin"" originates from insula, the Latin word for islet/island.In 1889, the physician Oskar Minkowski, in collaboration with Joseph von Mering, removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. On testing the urine, they found sugar, establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by the American physician and scientist Eugene Lindsay Opie, when he isolated the role of the pancreas to the islets of Langerhans: ""Diabetes mellitus when the result of a lesion of the pancreas is caused by destruction of the islands of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed"".[97][98][99] The structure of insulin. The left side is a space-filling model of the insulin monomer, believed to be biologically active. Carbon is green, hydrogen white, oxygen red, and nitrogen blue. On the right side is a ribbon diagram of the insulin hexamer, believed to be the stored form. A monomer unit is highlighted with the A chain in blue and the B chain in cyan. Yellow denotes disulfide bonds, and magenta spheres are zinc ions.Over the next two decades researchers made several attempts to isolate the islets' secretions. In 1906 George Ludwig Zuelzer achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but he was unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, E.L. Scott at the University of Chicago tried aqueous pancreatic extracts and noted ""a slight diminution of glycosuria"", but was unable to convince his director of his work's value; it was shut down. Israel Kleiner demonstrated similar effects at Rockefeller University in 1915, but World War I interrupted his work and he did not return to it.[100]In 1916, Nicolae Paulescu developed an aqueous pancreatic extract which, when injected into a diabetic dog, had a normalizing effect on blood-sugar levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because of World War I, and in 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in Bucharest and his tests on a diabetic dog. Later that year, he published ""Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation"".[101][102]Extraction and purification[edit]In October 1920, Canadian Frederick Banting concluded that the digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied were breaking down the islet secretion, thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. A surgeon by training, Banting knew certain arteries could be tied off that would lead most of the pancreas to atrophy, while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact. He reasoned that a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once most of the rest of the pancreas was gone. He jotted a note to himself: ""Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets. Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosuria.""[103]In the spring of 1921, Banting traveled to Toronto to explain his idea to J.J.R. Macleod, Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto. Macleod was initially skeptical, since Banting had no background in research and was not familiar with the latest literature, but he agreed to provide lab space for Banting to test out his ideas. Macleod also arranged for two undergraduates to be Banting's lab assistants that summer, but Banting required only one lab assistant. Charles Best and Clark Noble flipped a coin; Best won the coin toss and took the first shift. This proved unfortunate for Noble, as Banting kept Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and credit for the discovery with Best.[104] On 30 July 1921, Banting and Best successfully isolated an extract (""isleton"") from the islets of a duct-tied dog and injected it into a diabetic dog, finding that the extract reduced its blood sugar by 40% in 1 hour.[105][103]Banting and Best presented their results to Macleod on his return to Toronto in the fall of 1921, but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design, and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment. He moved Banting and Best into a better laboratory and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success, and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. Bottlenecked by the time-consuming task of duct-tying dogs and waiting several weeks to extract insulin, Banting hit upon the idea of extracting insulin from the fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands. By December, they had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult cow pancreas. Macleod discontinued all other research in his laboratory to concentrate on the purification of insulin. He invited biochemist James Collip to help with this task, and the team felt ready for a clinical test within a month.[103]On January 11, 1922, Leonard Thompson, a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the Toronto General Hospital, was given the first injection of insulin.[106] However, the extract was so impure that Thompson suffered a severe allergic reaction, and further injections were cancelled. Over the next 12 days, Collip worked day and night to improve the ox-pancreas extract. A second dose was injected on January 23, completely eliminating the glycosuria that was typical of diabetes without causing any obvious side-effects. The first American patient was Elizabeth Hughes, the daughter of U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes.[107] The first patient treated in the U.S. was future woodcut artist James D. Havens; Dr. John Ralston Williams imported insulin from Toronto to Rochester, New York, to treat Havens.[108]Banting and Best never worked well with Collip, regarding him as something of an interloper, and Collip left the project soon after. Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm Eli Lilly and Company had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly's head chemist, George B. Walden discovered isoelectric precipitation and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Shortly thereafter, insulin was offered for sale to the general public.Synthesis[edit]Purified animal-sourced insulin was initially the only type of insulin available to diabetics. The amino acid structure of insulin was characterized in the early 1950s by Frederick Sanger,[109] and the first synthetic insulin was produced simultaneously in the labs of Panayotis Katsoyannis at the University of Pittsburgh and Helmut Zahn at RWTH Aachen University in the early 1960s.[110][111] Synthetic crystalline bovine insulin was achieved by Chinese researchers in 1965.[112]The first genetically engineered, synthetic ""human"" insulin was produced using E. coli in 1978 by Arthur Riggs and Keiichi Itakura at the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope in collaboration with Herbert Boyer at Genentech.[11][12] Genentech, founded by Swanson, Boyer and Eli Lilly and Company, went on in 1982 to sell the first commercially available biosynthetic human insulin under the brand name Humulin.[12] The vast majority of insulin currently used worldwide is now biosynthetic recombinant ""human"" insulin or its analogues.[13]Recombinant insulin is produced either in yeast (usually Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or E. coli.[113] In yeast, insulin may be engineered as a single-chain protein with a KexII endoprotease (a yeast homolog of PCI/PCII) site that separates the insulin A chain from a c-terminally truncated insulin B chain. A chemically synthesized c-terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin; typically the lysine on the c-terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis. The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with c-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine). The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by Bruce Merrifield are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.Nobel Prizes[edit]The Nobel Prize committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the University of Toronto and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men: Frederick Banting and J.J.R. Macleod.[114] They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923 for the discovery of insulin. Banting, incensed that Best was not mentioned[115], shared his prize with him, and Macleod immediately shared his with James Collip. The patent for insulin was sold to the University of Toronto for one dollar.Two other Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on insulin. British molecular biologist Frederick Sanger determined the primary structure of insulin in 1955, making it the first protein to be sequenced.[109] Sanger was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. Rosalyn Sussman Yalow received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the radioimmunoassay for insulin.Several Nobel Prizes also have an indirect connection with insulin. George Minot, co-recipient of the 1934 Nobel Prize for the development of the first effective treatment for pernicious anemia, had diabetes mellitus. Dr. William Castle observed that the 1921 discovery of insulin, arriving in time to keep Minot alive, was therefore also responsible for the discovery of a cure for pernicious anemia.[116] Dorothy Hodgkin was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of crystallography. In 1969, after decades of work, Hodgkin determined the spatial conformation of insulin, the so-called tertiary structure, by means of X-ray diffraction studies.Controversy[edit]The work published by Banting, Best, Collip and Macleod represented the preparation of purified insulin extract suitable for use on human patients.[117] Although Paulescu discovered the principles of the treatment, his saline extract could not be used on humans; he was not mentioned in the 1923 Nobel Prize. Professor Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct ""the historical wrong"" against Nicolae Paulescu. Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow, Scotland, the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital, vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes, and a founding member of the International Diabetes Federation. Murray wrote:Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulescu, the distinguished Romanian scientist, who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in diabetic dogs.[118]In a private communication, Professor Arne Tiselius, former head of the Nobel Institute, expressed his personal opinion that Paulescu was equally worthy of the award in 1923.[119]See also[edit]Insulin analogAnatomy and physiolologyForms of diabetes mellitusTreatmentOther medical / diagnostic usesInsulin Signal Transduction pathwayOther usesReferences[edit]^ a b c GRCh38: Ensembl release 89: ENSG00000254647 - Ensembl, May 2017^ a b c GRCm38: Ensembl release 89: ENSMUSG00000000215 - Ensembl, May 2017^ ""Human PubMed Reference:"".^ ""Mouse PubMed Reference:"".^ a b Voet D, Voet JG (2011).

CrossFit Classes Designed for Older Adults,"At a recent wedding, 68-year-old Ellen Bonk showed a group of millennials how to ""get down"" to the Isley Brothers' Shout. ""When they sing 'a little bit softer now,' there was only one other person who got down lower to the floor than me and still got back up,"" Bonk says.When Bonk, a former hospital administrator, retired a few years ago, she could barely squat a few inches. The suburban Chicago woman had a bad knee and was out of shape from a sedentary lifestyle. Now, after a year participating in CrossFit classes, she can squat nearly to the ground and can bench press 50 pounds. ""I can do things I never dreamt I'd be able to do or even would have tried,"" she says.Bonk is among a growing number of CrossFit enthusiasts worldwide. The high intensity functional fitness program combines strength training with aerobic activity. It also promotes a diet of lean meats, nuts, vegetables and fruit.Former gymnast Greg Glassman opened the first CrossFit gym in 2001. There are now 15,000 facilities worldwide, making it one of the fastest-growing fitness chains.In CrossFit, participants perform functional exercises, meaning strengthening and aerobic activities that train and develop muscles to perform everyday tasks. For example, squats replicate the movement required to sit in a chair, and deadlifts mimic bending over to pick up a bag of groceries.Classes vary daily and can be scaled to any fitness level. Still, some older participants with physical limitations can feel intimidated working out with participants who can do things they can't, like lifting barbells overhead or climbing ropes.CrossFit Classes for Older AdultsThat's why CrossFit introduced special classes two years ago for participants who are older than 50. The movements in these classes are less complex and the exercises less rigorous. Translation: No rope climbing.Some CrossFit gyms call them ""Legends"" classes. Bonk's gym, CrossFit Iron Flag in Westmont, Ill., calls them ""Masters"" classes.But, whatever you call them, don't call them easy!At Iron Flag's 6 a.m. Masters class, nine participants grimace as they read the hour-long workout sheet Coach Melissa Gasper printed on the whiteboard: 63 dumbbell snatches, 63 wall balls, 63 kettlebell swings, 63 dumbbell push presses and 63 rows.A collective groan erupts from the group. ""Why 63? Why not 70?"" jokes 70-year-old Frank Getz.""You've done way more of these in other workouts,"" Gasper shoots back. ""Think about how you want to break them up to keep moving.""After a 15-minute warm-up that includes planks and stretches, the group gets down to business. The first exercise involves tossing a weighted ball up a wall, then squatting to catch it.Individual AttentionGasper has been coaching this group three days a week for a year, so she knows each participant's abilities and physical challenges. Getz has bad knees. Mary Tsoulos, 69, has arthritis in her hips. Tony Malone, 59, is recovering from shoulder surgery to repair an old sports injury. All of the group members need to modify some exercises.Gasper walks slowly behind the participants as they perform each movement. ""I'm making sure their bodies are moving in the plane they're supposed to be in,"" she explains. ""Once you start adding weight, if your mechanics aren't good, you're going to injure yourself.""Concern About the CrossFit Program's SafetySafety remains a big question for CrossFit, in general, not just for older adults. As yet, there hasn't been a comprehensive study on the risk of injury for those involved in the program.Mary TsoulosA handful of studies, including one released last fall by the Orthopedic Journal of Sports Medicine (OJSM), found CrossFit to be relatively safe compared to other fitness programs. But the OJSM study also found the risk of injury is greater for people during their first year of CrossFit training and for those who participate fewer than three times a week. The authors of the study recommended that CrossFit trainers offer beginner classes to help prevent injuries.Dr. Ross Arena, head of physical therapy at the University of Illinois-Chicago, says he supports any exercise program that gets people moving. But he advises patients with arthritis or back and knee issues to be cautious before starting CrossFit.""You probably would want to have those things checked out by a medical professional who would do additional diagnostic tests,"" Arena says.CrossFit Iron Flag interviews all new participants and puts them through six personal training sessions before they begin classes. Co-owner Kelly McGriff-Culver says that allows her to assess each participant's physical capabilities and limitations. ""Maybe they don't have overhead range of motion, so they really can't work on anything overhead until they work on mobility issues,"" she says.Exceeding Their Own ExpectationsAs the clock approaches 7 a.m. at Iron Flag, all nine of Gasper's Masters participants are sweaty, but satisfied. Everyone finished what they thought was an impossible workout in under an hour. ""It's what keeps them coming back. They don't think they can do it, but then they do,"" Gasper says.McGriff-Culver says a quarter of the 200 participants at her gym are older than 55, a segment she thinks will keep growing.CrossFit believes it's crucial for older adults to stay active in a supportive community and maintain a healthy diet. ""For this population, these behaviors can mean the difference between life and death or living at home versus a nursing home,"" says company spokesman Russ Greene.Malone won't argue with that. He's convinced CrossFit saved his life. Since joining the Masters class two years ago, he's shed 50 pounds along with his diabetes medication. ""If I didn't do this, I might be on another medicine or injecting insulin. I was not going in a good direction,"" he says.Tsoulos credits CrossFit's recommended diet and workouts with reducing her joint inflammation from arthritis and increasing her flexibility. ""Until two years ago I couldn't cross my legs,"" she says. ""I was in a movie theater and automatically crossed my legs and went, Wow!""By Diane EastabrookDiane Eastabrook is a Chicago-based journalist.

There is no other nutritional value to the oils. 07:45 Fasted exercise stimulates glucagon. 09:37 People may be confusing gluconeogenesis with an insulinogenic effect. 10:40 If you have ketogenesis happening, you have gluconeogenesis. 14:10 True clinical hypoglycemia is remarkably uncommon. 18:22 If you have food in your gut during exercise, your body is conflicted about sending blood to your muscles or your guts. 19:57 Protein increases insulin and glucagon. 21:02 Glucagon is catabolic of fat tissue. 23:00 Glucagon activates lipolysis, increasing free fatty acids. Hormones tell the body what to do with energy. 23:54 Acetyl-CoA is the branch point of all metabolic processes. Catecholamines and glucagon counter insulin, but insulin reigns supreme. 25:40 Consuming meat or saturated fat does not create lipotoxicity or insulin resistance. 30:17 It is easier to induce insulin mediated lipotoxicity with a vegan diet than a ketogenic diet due to the high carb content.30:43 Excess palmitate can create an excess of ceramides, as can hyperinsulinemia directly. 32:39 Triglycerides do not effect insulin sensitivity. 33:45 There are more ceramides in sedentary, obese, insulinemic individuals. 34:53 Alpha cells become insulin resistant because of a ceramide accumulation. 35:52 In type 1 diabetes, where you are not making insulin in the microenvironment, too much glucagon is produced, elevating glucose. 37:30 Both insulin and glucagon are high in type 2 diabetics. It should be one or the other. 40:15 Exogenous ketones shut down your body's ability for hepatic ketogenesis. Pulsed exogenous ketones can be helpful with TBI or other neurological issues.41:55 Glucagon activates processes that are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. 44:47 As you become more fat adapted, your body becomes more efficient and ketone baseline levels drop. 44:57 Once ketones are detectible from a low carb diet, metabolic pathways have been activated and insulin is low. 47:53 You cannot store ketones if insulin is low. 51:54 Any cell that you want to maintain and grow requires mTOR. Insulin promotes mTOR activation. 52:55 Leucine is a good mTOR activator in muscle. 53:22 A cancer cell will grow with chronic mTOR activation, but it is not the cause of the cancer. 54:41 Protein consumption does not correlate to cancer incidence. 55:41 Animal products are higher in protein and we absorb more. Plants are relatively deficient in protein and we do not absorb it effectively. 59:17 Carnitine is involved in lipid transport. 01:00:41 Leucine is the most anabolic amino acid and is a ketogenic amino acid. 01:01:22 Red meat is a great source of carnitine. Carnitine accelerates ketogenesis. 01:03:55 Cold induced uncoupling can stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling in muscle. 01:05:19 Ketones induce mitochondrial uncoupling in fat tissue, telling it that it is okay to waste energy. 01:08:56 Cold exposure has an immune benefit and a cognitive benefit, as well as the metabolic benefit.01:15:39 A main cause of endotoxemia can be LPS (lipopolysaccharide). This is accelerated when your body is absorbing lipid. 01:16:47 Dietary lipid consumption increases LDL, which can bind to LPS and result in its removal through the bile duct.",https://t.co/36APsaqfPC,others
Type 3 Diabetes,"Type 3 Diabetes Type 3 diabetes is a term for insulin resistance in the brain Type 3 diabetes is a title that has been proposed for Alzheimer's disease which results from resistance to insulin in the brain. Studies carried out by the research team at Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University identified the possibility of a new form of diabetes after finding that insulin resistance can occur in the brain Lead researcher, Dr Suzanne de la Monte, carried out a further study in 2012 to further investigate the link. The researchers pinpoint resistance to insulin and insulin-like growth factor as being a key part of the progression of Alzheimer's disease. [61] Whereas type 1 and type 2 diabetes are characterised by hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar), a separate study, carried out by the University of Pennsylvania and published in 2012, excluded people with a history of diabetes, indicating that Alzheimer's can develop without the presence of significant hyperglycemia in the brain. [62] Increased risk of Alzheimer's People that have insulin resistance, in particular those with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of suffering from Alzheimer's disease estimated to be between 50% and 65% higher. Researchers have discovered that many type 2 diabetics have deposits of a protein called amyloid beta in their pancreas which is similar to the protein deposits found in the brain tissue of Alzheimer's sufferers. Diabetes medication could treat Alzheimer's Researchers are also testing diabetes medication as potential treatments for the neurodegenerative disease. Incretin mimetic drugs, such as liraglutide (Victoza) and lixisenatide (Lyxumia), have shown potential for preventing the development of Alzheimer's disease are being investigated as a possible treatment. Pioglitazone (Actos) has shown evidence that it may also help towards preventing the development of Alzheimer's disease.

All animals were maintained in a specific antigen-free barrier facility with 12 h light/dark cycles (6 a.m. on and 6 p.m. off). Mice were fed a standard rodent chow (2016 Teklad Global 16% protein rodent diet, Harlan Laboratories). For inducing insulin resistance, C57BL/6J (Stock No. 000664, Jackson laboratory) were fed a HFD (60%) (OpenSource Diets, Cat. No. D12492).Glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and metabolic analysis were performed as described previously18. For in vivo pharmacological assays, 6- to 8-week-old male mice were fed HFD for 5 weeks. Two days before drug administration, mice were switched to normal chow. SHP099 (MedChem Express) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted into a 0.5% hypromellose and 0.1% Tween-80 solution. A unit of 60 mg kg−1 of SHP099 was administered by daily oral gavage for 6 days. For glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted for 14 h, and their blood glucose levels (T = 0) were measured with tail bleeding using a glucometer (AlphaTRAK). Then, 2 g of glucose per kg of body weight was injected intraperitoneally. Blood glucose levels were measured at the indicated time points after glucose injection. For insulin tolerance test, mice fasted for 4 h were injected intraperitoneally with recombinant human insulin (Eli Lilly) at 1 U per kg body weight, and their blood glucose levels were measured at the indicated time points after injection.ReagentsGeneration of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GST, MAD1, CDC20, and BUB1 was described previously18,61. The following antibodies were purchased from commercial sources: anti-ZO-1/TJP1 (Immunohistochemistry (IHC), 1:100; #402200) and anti-ACTIN (Western blotting (WB), 1:1000; MA137018, Thermo Scientific); anti-IR-pY1150/1151 (WB, 1:1000; 19H7; labeled as pY1152/1153 IR for mouse IR in this study), anti-IRS1-pS616 (WB, 1:1000; C15H5; labeled as pS612 IRS1 for mouse IRS1 in this study), anti-AKT (WB, 1:1000; 40D4), anti-pT308 AKT (WB, 1:1000; D25E6), anti-ERK1/2 (WB, 1:1000; L34F12), anti-pERK1/2 (WB, 1:1000; 197G2), anti-SHP2 (WB, 1:1000; D50F2), and anti-RAB7 (Immunofluorescence (IF), 1:200; D95F2, Cell Signaling); anti-IRS1-pY612 (WB, 1:1000; labeled as pY608 IRS1 for mouse IRS1 in this study), anti-IR-pY972 (WB, 1:1000; labeled as pY962 IR for mouse IR in this study), and anti-IR (WB, 1:1000; IF, 1:100; CT-3, Millipore); anti-AP2B1 (WB, 1:1000; BD Biosciences); anti-IRS2 (WB, 1:1000; EPR904) and anti-AP2M1 (WB, 1:1000; EP2695Y, Abcam); anti-GFP (IF, 1:500; #11814460001) and anti-MYC (WB, 1:1000; IF, 1:500; 9E10; Roche); anti-IRS1 (WB, 1:1000; A301-158A, Bethyl Laboratory); anti-CEACAM1 (WB, 1:1000; 283340, R&amp;D Systems); anti-ACTIN (WB, 1:1000; C-4), anti-IR (WB, 1:1000; IF, 1:100; CT-3, Santa Cruz); and anti-mCherry (IF, 1:100; 1C51, Novus).The siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and had the following sequences: human BUBR1 (GGACACAUUUAGAUGCACUtt); human CDC20 (AGAACAGACUGAAAGUACUUU); human MAD1 (GAGCAGAUCCGUUCGAAGUUU); human BUB3 (GAGUGGCAGUUGAGUAUUU); human BUB1 (GAGUGAUCACGAUUUCUAA); human IRS1 (GAACCUGAUUGGUAUCUACdTdT); human IRS2 (On-TARGETplus human IRS2 (8660) siRNA-SMARTpool); human CEACAM1 #1 (CCAUCAUGCUGAACGUAAA); human CEACAM1 #2 (GAUCAUAGUCACUGAGCUA); human CEACAM1 #3 (CGUAUUGGUGUGAGGUCUU); human CEACAM1 #4 (CCAUUAAGUACAUGUGCCA); human IR (GGGUGGAAGUUUAGGGUUAUU); and siLUC (UCAUUCCGGAUACUGCGAU). The cDNAs encoding human IRS1 and human AP2M1 were purchased from Thermo Scientific. pBabe-puro mouse IRS2 was a gift from Dr. Ronald Kahn (Addgene plasmid #11371). The siRNA-resistant and YXXΦ motif mutants of IRS1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technology). IRS1 peptides (YMPMS, CHTDDGYMPMSPGVA; AMPAS, CHTDDGAMPASPGVA; pYMPMS, CHTDDGpYMPMSPGVA; YMPMpS, CHTDDGYMPMpSPGVA; and pYMPMpS, CHTDDGpYMPMpSPGVA) were chemically synthesized at KareBay Biochem, Inc.For testing the effects of kinase inhibitors on IR endocytosis, the cells were serum starved for 14 h and inhibitors were added at 2 h before insulin treatment. Inhibitors used in this study were as follows: the IR kinase inhibitor BMS536924 (2 μM; Tocris), the MEK inhibitors U0126 (40 μM; Cell signaling) and PD0325901 (10 μM; Selleck Chemicals), the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 (10 μM; Medchem express), the AKT inhibitor VIII (5 μM, Calbiochem), the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 (10 μM; Selleck Chemicals), the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 (200 nM, Selleck Chemicals), and the MPS1 inhibitor Reversine (1 μM, Sigma).Cell culture, transfection, and viral infection293FT cells were obtained from Invitrogen (R70007). HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; ATCC HB-8065). 293FT and HepG2 cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. No mycoplasma contaminations were detected in these cells. Plasmid transfections into 293FT and HepG2 cells were performed with LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). siRNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).293FT or HepG2 cells expressing IR-GFP WT, or mutants were generated previously18. A list of primers used in this study is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Briefly, cDNAs encoding IR mutants were cloned into the pBabe-GFP-puro vector. The vectors were co-transfected with viral packaging vectors into 293FT cells, and the viral supernatants were collected at 2 and 3 days after transfection. The concentrated viruses were added to 293FT and HepG2 cells with 4 μg ml−1 of polybrene. Cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg ml−1 for 293FT and 2 μg ml−1 for HepG2) at 3 days after infection and sorted by flow cytometry to collect cells expressing similar levels of IR-GFP.For the expression of IRS1 WT or mutants in HepG2 cells, cDNA encoding IRS1 WT or mutants were cloned into the pBabe-mCherry-puro vector. The vectors were co-transfected with viral packaging vectors into 293FT cells, and the viral supernatants were collected. The concentrated viruses were added to HepG2 cells stably expressing IR-GFP WT. The cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA at 1 day after viral infection. Analysis was performed at 4 days after infection. The cells were serum starved for 14 h before insulin treatment.Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 2-month-old male mice with a standard two-step collagenase perfusion procedure. Cells were plated on collagen-coated dishes and incubated in attachment medium [Williams' E Medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS, 10 nM insulin, 10 nM dexamethasone, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin]. After 2–4 h, the medium was changed to low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS, 10 nM dexamethasone, 10 nM insulin, 100 nM triiodothyronine, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. After 1 day, the cells were serum starved for 14 h and treated with DMSO or SHP099 for 2 h.AAV encoding SHP2 shRNA (AAV8-GFP-U6-mPTPN11-shRNA) or control shRNA (AAV-GFP-U6-scrmb-shRNA) were generated at Vector Biolabs. We injected 10- to 11-week-old male mice fed with HFD for 5 weeks with the viruses at 1 × 1012 genomic copies per mouse. Experiments were performed at 2 weeks after virus injection.Tissue histology and immunohistochemistryMouse tissues were fixed in buffered 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) for hematoxylin and eosin staining by the Molecular Pathology Core at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. For human patient sample analysis, the deparaffinized sections were subjected to antigen retrieval with 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0), incubated with 0.3% H2O2, blocked with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then incubated first with anti-IR (CT-3, Millipore, 1:100) and anti-ZO-1 (Thermo Scientific, 1:200) antibodies and then with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse and Alex Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit; Molecular Probes). The slides were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Five to nine images (depends on the percentage of normal hepatocytes) were randomly taken under ×40 magnification. The total cell numbers and numbers of IR PM-positive cells were counted at least twice for individual images. Total cell numbers are counted with images stained with the ZO-1 membrane marker. Over 100 cells were analyzed for each patient samples. All immunohistochemistry and scoring were performed blinded to the diabetes status. Human tissue collection and analysis were performed under the supervision of the Institutional Review Board (STU 062013-043).Metabolic profilingBlood samples were collected from overnight-fasted mice using submandibular bleeding methods. For serum preparation, blood was allowed to form clots at room temperature for 30 min, centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and stored at −80 °C. Serum insulin and C-peptide levels were determined with the STELLUX Chemic Rodent Insulin ELISA kit (Alpco) and Mouse C-peptide ELISA kit (Alpco), respectively. ELISA analysis for insulin and C-peptide was performed by Metabolic Phenotyping Core at UT Southwestern Medical Center.Immunoprecipitation and quantitative western blotsCells were incubated with the cell lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)] supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) and PhosSTOP (Roche) on ice for 1 h. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with antibody-conjugated beads. The beads were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with the SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting. For quantitative western blots, anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H + L) (Dylight 800 or 680 conjugates) and anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Dylight 800 or 680 conjugates) (Cell Signaling) were used as secondary antibodies. The membranes were scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Uncropped and unprocessed scans of the most important blots are provided in the Source Data file.For analyzing the ratios of phospho/total protein signals, the band intensities of phospho-proteins and total proteins were measured at the indicated time points. The values were divided by the basal intensities of phospho-proteins and total proteins, respectively. The relative intensities of phospho-proteins were divided by the relative intensities of total proteins in each condition to yield the final ratios.ImmunofluorescenceIndirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on cells grown on coverslips and fixed in cold methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. The fixed cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min and 3% BSA in 0.1% PBST for 1 h, and then treated with diluted antibodies in 0.3% BSA in 0.1% PBST at 4 °C overnight. After being washed, cells were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies and mounted on microscope slides in ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images of fixed cells were acquired as a series of 0.4 μm stacks with a DeltaVision system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Raw images were deconvolved using the iterative algorithm implemented in the softWoRx software (Applied precision, Issaquash, WA). The central section of a 0.4 µm z-stack containing three contiguous focal planes was used for quantification. The cell edges were defined with Image J. The whole cell signal intensity (WC) and IC signal intensity (IC) were measured. The PM signal intensity (PM) was calculated by subtracting IC from WC. Identical exposure times and magnifications were used for all comparative analyses.Protein purificationThe full-length human AP2M1 was cloned into a pGEX 6P-1, and the plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Protein expression was induced by 0.2 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 25 °C overnight. The harvested pellets were lysed in the lysis buffer I [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF]. After sonication, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatants were filtered by 0.45 μm filter and incubated with pre-equilibrated Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). The resulting protein-bound beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer I.The AP2M1 fragment (residues 160–435) was cloned into a modified pET28a that introduced an N-terminal His6-tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. The plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3). Protein expression was induced by 0.2 mM IPTG at 20 °C overnight. The harvested pellets were lysed in the lysis buffer II [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 1 mM PMSF]. After sonication, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatants were filtered by 0.45 μm filter and incubated with pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen). Protein-bound beads were washed with 150 ml of wash buffer I [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole] and with 50 ml of wash buffer II [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole]. The proteins were then eluted with the elution buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 150 mM imidazole] and incubated with thrombin (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The protein was further purified with a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare). The relevant protein fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and snap-frozen for future experiments.Crystallization of the AP2M1-pIRS1 complexThe purified AP2M1 (residues 160–435) was mixed with the pS-IRS1 peptide (CHTDDGYMPMpSPGVA, residues 607–620) at a molar ratio of 1:5 and then crystalized with the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals of the AP2M1–pS-IRS1 complex grew within few days after the protein solution was mixed with the reservoir solution [1.0 M sodium malonate, pH 5.0, 0.1 M sodium acetate tri-hydrate, pH 4.5, and 2% (w/v) PEG 20k]. All crystals were cryoprotected with the reservoir solution including 15% (w/v) glycerol for data collection.Data collection and structure determinationX-ray diffraction datasets were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline Sector 19-ID at a wavelength of 0.97914 Å and at 100 K. HKL3000 was used to process the datasets62. The crystal of the AP2M1–pS-IRS1 complex diffracted to a minimum Bragg spacing of 3.2 Å and exhibited the symmetry of space group P64 with cell dimensions of a = b = 125.33 Å, c = 74.82 Å. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, with a 53.4% solvent content.The structure was determined by molecular replacement with PHASER-MR63, using the structure of the AP2M-IGN38 complex (PDB ID: 1BXX) as the search model. Structure refinement was performed with COOT and PHENIX64,65,66. The final Rwork and Rfree were 20.3% and 23.6%, respectively. The Ramachandran statistics indicated that 91%, 8.4%, and 0.4% of the residues were in the favored, the allowed, and outliers regions, respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1. The model quality was validated with Molprobity67. All structural figures were generated with the program PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/) with the same color and labeling schemes.Protein-binding assaysFor GST pull-down assays of IVT IRS1 or IRS2 proteins, beads bound to GST-AP2M1 or GST were incubated with IVT products diluted in the cell lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation and washing, proteins bound to beads were eluted with the SDS loading buffer, resolved with SDS-PAGE, and detected with Coomassie staining or immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies.For peptide pull-down assays, 2 mg peptides were coupled to beads with the SulfoLink Immobilization Kit (Thermo Scientific). Beads were resuspended in Buffer A [50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM EDTA] as a 1:1 slurry. Ten microliter beads were incubated with 1 μg purified AP2M1 protein (residues 160–435) on a rotator at 4 °C for overnight. The beads were washed five times with Buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.The ITC assays were performed with a MicroCal Omega ITC200 titration calorimeter (GE Life Sciences) at 20 °C with minor modifications68. Briefly, the recombinant AP2M1 protein (residues 160–435) and peptides were dialyzed into the HEPES buffer [25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl]. For each titration, 300 μl of AP2M1 (50 μM) were added to the calorimeter cell. IRS1 peptides (YMPMS, 528.9 μM or YMPMpS, 507.4 μM) were injected with an injection syringe in nineteen 2.0-μl portions. Raw data were processed and fitted with the NITPIC software package69.Phosphatase assaysActive SHP2 (2.9 μM, SignalChem) diluted in the phosphatase dilution buffer [50 mM imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 65 ng μl−1 BSA] was incubated with IRS1 peptides (2.6 mM) at 37 °C for the indicated time points. Two microliters of reaction products were spotted onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad) and dried completely. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h, and washed once with TBS-T (0.02% Tween 20). The membrane was incubated with anti-IRS1-pY612 antibodies diluted in TBS-T at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS-T, the anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) Dylight 800 conjugates (Cell Signaling) were applied as secondary antibodies. The membranes were scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) for quantification.In vivo insulin signaling and IR endocytosis assaysHFD-fed mice were administered vehicle or SHP099 for 5 days. The mice were fasted overnight and administered vehicle or SHP099 once more. At 2 h after the last administration, the mice were injected with or without 1 U insulin (3.19 µM, Eli Lilly) via inferior vena cava. For hepatic knockdown of SHP2, mice fed HFD were injected with AAV-GFP or SHP shRNA. At 17 days after injection, the mice were fasted overnight and injected with or without 1 U insulin (Eli Lilly) via inferior vena cava. The livers were collected at the indicated time points. WAT and skeletal muscles were collected at 2 and 3 min after the indicated time points, respectively. Thirty micrograms of tissue was mixed with the cell lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mM DTT, and 2 mM PMSF] supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche), PhosSTOP (Roche), 25 U ml−1 turbo nuclease (Accelagen), and 100 μM cytochalasin B (Sigma), homogenized with Minilys (Bertin Technologies), and then incubated on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 20,817 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, the lysates were analyzed by quantitative western blotting. For IR endocytosis assays, the livers were fixed in 10% NBF and embedded in paraffin blocks. Sections were deparaffinized, subjected to immunohistochemistry as described in the Tissue histology and immunohistochemistry section. Images of sections were acquired as a series of 0.4 μm stacks with a DeltaVision system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Images were analyzed as described in the Immunofluorescence section.Statistical analysesPrism was used for the generation of all curves and graphs and for statistical analyses. Results are presented as mean ± s.e.m. or mean ± s.d. Two-tailed unpaired t tests were used for pairwise significance analysis. Mann-Whitney test, a non-parametric test, was performed for human sample analysis. Sample sizes were determined on the basis of the maximum number of mice that could be bred in similar ages to maintain well-matched controls. Power calculations for sample sizes were not performed. We monitored weight and health conditions of mice, and excluded mice from experiments if the animal was unhealthy and the body weight was more than two standard deviations from the mean. Randomization and blinding methods were not used, and data were analyzed after the completion of all data collection in each experiment.",https://t.co/B3TRWboRkK,others

News Bureau | ILLINOIS,"CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — Scientists at the University of Illinois have developed new hybrids of purple corn containing different combinations of phytochemicals that may fight obesity, inflammation and diabetes, a new study in mice indicates.The pericarp of purple corn kernels is loaded with healthy anthocyanins and could provide manufacturers with a natural form of pigments for foods and beverages.Photo by L. Brian StaufferDeleteEdit embedded media in the Files Tab and re-insert as needed.The pericarp – or outer layer – of purple and other brightly colored corn kernels also may provide an alternative source of colorants for food products, giving corn producers another value-added product from their crop, said the U. of I. team led by food science professor Elvira Gonzalez de Mejia and crop sciences professor John Juvik. They published their findings recently in the journal Food Chemistry.From a strain of maize called Apache Red, Juvik's team bred 20 genetic varieties of purple corn, each with a unique combination of anthocyanins, the nutritious, natural pigments that give the pericarp its vibrant color.Widely found in plant tissues, phenolic compounds tend to be aromatic and contribute to the color, flavor and acidity of fruits. Anthocyanins are one class of phenols, and studies have associated the consumption of anthocyanin-rich foods with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.Using pressurized water, postdoctoral researcher and study co-author Diego Luna-Vital extracted the anthocyanins from the pericarp of the corn kernels, creating anthocyanin-rich water extracts that were then freeze-dried. While analyses of the extracts showed that the pericarp is an abundant source of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, the concentration varied significantly among the varieties.To examine the impact of anthocyanins on obesity-induced inflammation, then-graduate student and first author of the study Qiaozhi Zhang combined fat cells – called adipocytes – from mice with large immune cells called macrophages.The mouse cell models in the study simulated those of obese people with high concentrations of lipids and inflammation in their cells, or healthy individuals who regularly eat plants containing phenolic compounds, de Mejia said. ""So these are very real models that can be translated into in vivo studies with humans or animals.""""We evaluated some very specific biomarkers already known to be related to inflammation and adipogenesis, which is the conversion of pre-adipocytes to mature adipocytes that accumulate fat,"" Luna-Vital said.They observed that the phenolic compounds in the extracts altered the cells' development, reducing the adipocytes' fat content from 8%-56%, depending on the differing phenols used.To study the compounds' impact on insulin resistance, the metabolic dysfunction associated with diabetes, the scientists used a cell-signaling protein to induce insulin resistance in the mouse fat cells, then treated the cells with the anthocyanin compounds and monitored their glucose uptake.A key marker of insulin resistance decreased by 29%-64%, they found, and the cells' glucose uptake decreased by 30%-139%, depending on the chemical composition of the anthocyanins used.""We observed very important changes in molecules that reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in the insulin-resistant adipocytes,"" Luna-Vital said. ""We also found important changes in pro-inflammatory molecules in the immune cells.""The findings suggested that different levels and chemical compositions of these phenolic compounds might prevent obesity or improve the insulin profile of people who are obese, Luna-Vital said.The smaller phenols such as quercetin, luteolin and rutin – which are present in many plant foods – played key roles in reducing some of the obesity, inflammation and some markers of Type 2 diabetes, de Mejia said. ""While others, such as vanillic and protocatechuic acid, decreased the potential conversion of pre-adipocytes to adipocytes.""She cautioned, though, that ""it's very important to note that it's not just one or two compounds, but the combinations of phenolics"" working together that were responsible for the beneficial effects.Graduate student and study co-author Laura Chatham currently is performing genomic selection to identify the DNA markers associated with the most promising health effects in order to breed corn hybrids with those properties, Juvik said.In addition to its health-promoting properties, the pericarp of red, purple and other brightly hued corn could serve as natural pigments for the food industry, satisfying strong consumer demand for alternatives to synthetic dyes, Juvik said. ""We calculated that all of the red dye No. 40 – one of the major dyes used in the U.S. – could be replaced with the pigment derived from about 600,000 acres of corn,"" Juvik said. ""And we could produce the anthocyanin-rich pericarp in sufficient quantities for manufacturers to add it to beverages or special products with pharmaceutical properties.""Another advantage to dried corn is that it's shelf-stable, providing an economical substitute for the perishable fruits and vegetables that manufacturers also currently use to color many foods and beverages, he said.""The advantage to using water to extract the anthocyanins from the pericarp is that it's the most simple, straightforward and inexpensive way for industry to remove these compounds, compared with other extraction protocols that are complicated and more expensive,"" Juvik said.Water extraction is also a ""green"" process, compliant with environmental and food and drug regulations, said de Mejia, also the director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences.U. of I. agricultural and biological engineering professors Vijay Singh and Deepak Kumar, and undergraduate student Subhiksha Chandrasekaran co-wrote the study, along with Tianyi Tao of Zhejiang University, China.The research was supported by a U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture grant.",https://t.co/eYO1XkmfZR,others

Although it reported that most of these errors resulted in ""no harm,"" others caused ""low-to-moderate harm"" or ""severe harm or death."" Characterizing the errors as ""relatively common but preventable,"" the journal's article also included recommendations for preventing the mistakes and case examples for each.Based on claims data, observational research and patient safety incident reports, The Pharmaceutical Journal indicated that the top 10 prescribing errors were related to the following:omissions or delays;anticoagulants;opioid analgesics;insulin;nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs;drugs that require regular blood test monitoring;known allergy to medicine, including antibiotics;drug interactions;loading doses; andoxygen.The authors concluded the following strategies were universally applicable to reducing the risk of prescribing errors.

Can You Make Up For Lost Sleep? And How Much Is Losing Sleep Hurting You In The First Place?,"""And if tonight my soul may find her peace in sleep, and sink in good oblivion, and in the morning wake like a new-opened flower, then I have been dipped again in God, and new-created.""~D.H. Lawrence So we celebrated ""National Napping Day"" Monday—the ironic tradition of praising sleep the day after we lose it through the Daylight Savings time change. Even President Donald Trump is ready to get rid of that. But it's a new day, and it just so happens that March 15th recognizes ""Everything You Think Is Wrong Day."" And just one of those misconceptions that we can dispose of today is the idea that you can make up for sleep you've lost during the week by sleeping in on the weekend. University of Colorado researchers have found that people with consistent sleep deprivation gained weight and experienced a loss of insulin sensitivity. The researchers said that attempting to make up for lost sleep on the weekend not only didn't counter the harm done to metabolism, it seemed to have made it worse. Experts recommend that adults get at least 7 hours of sleep every night, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). That's true of older adults as well, but many seniors don't get the sleep they need, because they often have more trouble falling asleep, sleep less deeply and wake up more often throughout the night. ""Many people believe that poor sleep is a normal part of aging, but it is not. Sleep patterns change as we age, but disturbed sleep and waking up tired every day are not part of normal aging,"" Live Science reports. Whatever the cause for lost sleep, scores of people try to make up for these deficits by sleeping more on their days off. Scientists now say that not only can you not make up for lost sleep, but you're likely damaging your health long-term by not getting enough sleep in the first place. Findings from the Global Burden of Disease study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), found that 603 million adults were obese in 2015, and cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the first and second, respectively, leading causes of death from a high body mass index (BMI). And studies have repeatedly shown that insufficient sleep and untreated sleep disorders are recognized risk factors for obesity and diabetes. The Colorado researchers outlined that specifically, ""insufficient sleep alters several behavioral and physiological processes implicated in metabolic dysregulation, including regulation of energy intake and delayed circadian timing, which results in weight gain and reduced insulin sensitivity."" Researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr. from the University of Colorado studied the effects of make-up sleep on metabolism on 36 healthy men and women. The study was funded by NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and others and published in February in Current Biology. In the study, Participants spend two weeks in the researchers' sleep lab. After being allowedr three nights of normal sleep, the participants were split into three groups. One group was permitted to sleep up to 9 hours a night. Another was allowed a maximum of only 5 hours sleep a night for the length of the study. And the last group modeled ""weekend recovery sleep."" They slept 5 hours per night for 5 days, slept in for 2 days, then returned to sleep deprivation for another 2 days. The researchers then measured eating patterns, changes in insulin sensitivity (the body's ability to use insulin properly and control blood glucose levels) and weight gain for each of the participants. ""Consistent sleep deprivation quickly distorted metabolism,"" the NIH reported. ""Compared to people who slept normally, those who only slept 5 hours a night snacked more after dinner and gained an average of about 3 pounds during the study. Their bodies' sensitivity to insulin decreased by 13% over the two-week period."" Researchers found that recovery sleep didn't provide any benefit over continuous sleep deprivation. ""Though they were allowed to sleep as much as they wanted over a weekend, participants in the recovery sleep group only managed to get an average of 3 hours extra sleep over 2 nights."" Further, the extra sleep on the weekend ""actually disrupted the participants' body rhythms when they returned to sleep deprivation. Following the recovery sleep period, they were more likely to wake up when their natural body rhythm was still promoting sleep,"" the NIH reported. ""Our findings suggest that weekend recovery sleep is not an effective strategy to prevent metabolic dysregulation associated with recurrent insufficient sleep,"" the authors wrote. Colorado researchers are certainly not the first to link sleep deprivation to poor health. Another study by researchers including David Holtzman, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and published in the Science in January suggests that sleep loss encourages the spread of the toxic Alzheimer's protein, tau, and that tau-targeting treatments might slow the devastating disease. ""Though much of the hope has focused on developing the right drugs, some has also focused on sleep and its nightly ability to reset the brain's metabolic harmony,"" the NIH reports. Tau accumulates in abnormal tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. ""In the healthy brain, active neurons naturally release some tau during waking hours, but it normally gets cleared away during sleep. Essentially, your brain has a system for taking the garbage out while you're off in dreamland,"" the NIH reports. ""The latest findings in studies of mice and people further suggest that sleep deprivation upsets this balance, allowing more tau to be released, accumulate, and spread in toxic tangles within brain areas important for memory,"" the NIH reports. ""While more study is needed, the findings suggest that regular and substantial sleep may play an unexpectedly important role in helping to delay or slow down Alzheimer's disease."" Holtzman's team wanted to know if tau levels in the brain are naturally tied to the sleep-wake cycle. They found that tau levels do rise when we're awake and fall when we sleep. In studies of mice, researchers found that tau levels in brain fluid nearly double when the animals were awake and that sleep deprivation caused tau levels in brain fluid to double yet again. ""Once tau begins to accumulate in brain tissue, the protein can spread from one brain area to the next along neural connections. Holtzman's team wondered whether a lack of sleep over longer periods also might encourage tau to spread,"" the NIH reported. ""To find out, mice engineered to produce human tau fibrils in their brains were made to stay up longer than usual and get less quality sleep over several weeks. Those studies showed that, while less sleep didn't change the original deposition of tau in the brain, it did lead to a significant increase in tau's spread. Intriguingly, tau tangles in the animals appeared in the same brain areas affected in people with Alzheimer's disease."" Another study published in January in Science Translational Medicine by Holtzman's team established yet another link between tau and poor sleep. That study showed that older people who had more tau tangles in their brains had less slow-wave, deep sleep. ""Together, these new findings suggest that Alzheimer's disease and sleep loss are even more intimately intertwined than had been realized,"" the NIH reports. ""The findings suggest that good sleep habits and/or treatments designed to encourage plenty of high-quality Zzzz's might play an important role in slowing Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, poor sleep also might worsen the condition and serve as an early warning sign of Alzheimer's."" Another recent study added to the evidence that sleep deprivation can increase buildup of beta-amyloid in the brain. The small study found that losing just one night of sleep led to an increase in the protein in the brain associated with impaired brain function and Alzheimer's disease. A metabolic waste product that's found in the fluid between brain cells (neurons), beta-amyloid has been linked to impaired brain function and Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's, the beta-amyloid clumps together to form amyloid plaques, which hinder communication between neurons. Studies suggest that sleep plays a role in clearing beta-amyloid out of the brain, reports the NIH, and lack of sleep has been shown to elevate brain beta-amyloid levels in mice. Less is known, however, about the impact of sleep deprivation on beta-amyloid levels in people. A recent study led by Drs. Nora D. Volkow and Gene-Jack Wang of NIH's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), showed beta-amyloid accumulation of about 5% in the hippocampus, thalamus and nearby regions of 20 healthy participants after just one night of sleep deprivation. These brain regions are especially vulnerable to damage in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. ""This research provides new insight about the potentially harmful effects of a lack of sleep on the brain and has implications for better characterizing the pathology of Alzheimer's disease,"" said Dr. George F. Koob, director of NIAAA. And the link between poor sleep and poor health doesn't end with the brain. Heart disease is the leading cause of death among women and men in the United States, and its most common cause is plaque buildup inside the arteries or atherosclerosis. Recent research has also linked sleep deficiency and certain sleep disorders to an increased risk of heart disease. In another NIH-supported study, a team led by Dr. Filip Swirski at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital found that sleep-disrupted mice developed larger arterial plaques than the mice with normal sleep patterns, had twice the level of certain white blood cells, and had lower amounts of hypocretin, a hormone made by the brain that plays a key role in regulating sleep and wake states (also known as orexin). Their experiments also showed that hypocretin suppressed the production of stem cells that make the white blood cells in their bone marrow. ""Sleep-deficient mice that received hypocretin supplementation tended to produce fewer immune cells and develop smaller artery wall plaques than mice that weren't given the supplementation. These results suggest that hypocretin loss during disrupted sleep contributes to inflammation and atherosclerosis,"" researchers reported. ""This appears to be the most direct demonstration yet of the molecular connections linking blood and cardiovascular risk factors to sleep health,"" says Dr. Michael Twery, director of NHLBI's National Center on Sleep Disorders Research. These and other studies show that not only does sleep help you feel rested and energized for the day, but what does or doesn't happen during sleep can be critical to your long-term health. While we sleep, our brains and bodies don't shut down. Internal organs and processes are hard at work throughout the night, says Dr. Merrill Mitler, a sleep expert and neuroscientist at NIH. ""Sleep services all aspects of our body in one way or another: molecular, energy balance, as well as intellectual function, alertness and mood,"" he said. Sleep helps you think more clearly, have quicker reflexes and focus better, says Mitler, and loss of sleep impairs your higher levels of reasoning, problem-solving and attention to detail. ""Sleep affects almost every tissue in our bodies,"" said Dr. Michael Twery, a sleep expert at NIH. ""It affects growth and stress hormones, our immune system, appetite, breathing, blood pressure and cardiovascular health."" Research shows that a lack of sleep increases not only the risk for obesity and heart disease but of infections and can even affect the efficiency of vaccinations, says Twery, adding that research has shown that well-rested people who received the flu vaccine developed stronger protection against the illness. According to Twery, a good night's sleep consists of 4 to 5 sleep cycles. Each cycle includes periods of deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when we dream. About 70 million Americans of all ages suffer from chronic sleep problems, the NIH reports. These findings serve as a reminder that all of us should do our best to get a good night's rest on a regular basis.Robin Seaton Jefferson lives just outside of St. Louis with her husband of 25 years and two daughters.

The Fight For Affordable Insulin To Keep My Child Alive,"The Fight For Affordable Insulin To Keep My Child AliveBy: Mindie Hooley""Your son has type 1 diabetes and he is in DKA. If you would have waited 3 more hours to drive him to the next nearest hospital, he would have died in your car."" These words have echoed through my mind every day since my son was diagnosed 3 ½ years ago.On January 2018, two years after my son was diagnosed, we had a change in our health insurance coverage. ""Your total for 3 vials of insulin will be $800.00"", said our local pharmacist. These new words have been added to my constant thoughts and now have become one of my greatest fears.Every day I don't just have to worry about my son's constant struggle with his high and low blood sugars, but I also have to worry about the cost to keep him alive.When a newborn baby is placed in your arms, a sense of worry and sudden protection is placed in your heart because an instant love and bond is formed between mother and baby. As a mom, all I have ever wanted for my son was for him to feel loved and protected. A whole new level of worry and protection is placed in your heart when you hear the words from your child's ER doctor saying, ""your 15-year-old son has an uncurable disease.""Sadly, I thought that nothing could top that sense of protection that was placed in my heart when my son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes until the day we had to leave our local pharmacy without his life-saving medication because we didn't have $800.00 to buy his insulin since this was a very unexpected expense.This very day is the day I became more protective of my son than ever before. I went home and got on the phone immediately and called our insurance company to find out why the cost of my son's insulin would be $800.00. Sadly, I was told by our insurance company that no insulin would be covered at all until we reached our high deductible of $5000.00. How on earth could this be possible that our insurance company won't cover any insulin at all? He can't live without insulin. How can an insurance company not protect my child? How am I going to pay $800.00 every month for his insulin along with all his other diabetic supplies? This adds up to thousands of dollars every month. Can this be happening to other families, too?After this very heartbreaking phone call with our insurance company and with all my thoughts and questions I had, I went online to do some research to see how we can obtain affordable insulin for my son.I applied for every patient assistant program there was, and over a course of a couple months, we were denied for every one of them. We either made $100 or $500 too much. This same day, I came across some other stories online just like mine where people had not been able to afford their insulin, and this resorted in them rationing insulin and sadly dying.I sat there praying and crying knowing that the very thing my son needed the most, I was not able to give him that day. My heart also broke for the stories of these other families as I was starting to experience what it was like to not be able to protect my son that I had protected for 17 years. Why is that when you are denied from these patient assistance programs, these companies let you walk off knowing you still can't buy your life-saving medication? I will never understand this.The day we left our local pharmacy without his insulin, I started to pray to hopefully figure out a way to help my son. After a lot of praying that day, the only answer I had received from praying was 'reach out to everyone you can and tell them your story. Find someone who will listen.' So, this is what I did. I started my endless journey of contacting every news source I could. I also started commenting on every social media post I saw that pertained to unaffordable healthcare telling my story of how much we pay for my sons' insulin a month in hopes that someone important would read my story. I also contacted every member of Congress pleading for them to do something about our healthcare system, but no one responded back… This went on for exactly one year. During this year, a lot of anger and frustration built inside me because no one was listening to my story and I desperately wanted to help my son. Nothing had changed with our insurance over this year. My husband got injured at work a week after we were told that my son's insulin would be $800.00 a month, which meant that my husband wasn't able to work as much as before and his weekly paychecks were $300.00 less, which made it even harder to buy his insulin and other diabetic supplies. I sadly found out three months later that my son had been rationing his insulin trying to save us money because he knew the financial struggles we were going through with all his medical expenses. He had been using a third less insulin than he was supposed to. My heart was broken that he would take matters in his own hands like that because as his mom, I am supposed to protect him, but instead, he was protecting me by not using as much insulin as he should.From January 2018 to January 2019 I worked very hard trying to tell every news source my struggles with unaffordable insulin until finally, I woke up one January morning in 2019 to a message from CNN. The message was from the CNN producer asking if I would be willing to share my family's story with them about the financial struggles we have gone through with buying my sons insulin. I couldn't believe it!!! Finally, after a full year, someone had finally listened to me and wanted to share our story. I was so happy. I knew once our family's story was out for the world to read that more awareness would come with members of Congress being more aware that people in the United States are suffering and dying from not being able to afford life-saving medication. This was the moment I had been waiting for to help my son as I had felt helpless for a full year before this. My prayers were finally answered. My heart was breaking every day for him because every human being deserves to live without the worry of being able to afford medication.The story about my family came out from CNN on January 30, 2019 and since then many wonderful opportunities have come to my family. We have been written about by our local newspaper, ABC Utah, The Washington Daily Report, New York Magazine, Beyond Type 1, two Presidential candidates have mentioned my family by posting about our CNN article on social media, and I had the opportunity to be in a video segment on the Dr. Oz show too about the high cost of insulin.Recently some hearings on the high cost of insulin have been happening on Capitol Hill and I have been told that members of Congress have read my stories and have used them to better understand that Americans are struggling with affordable insulin. My story sadly has been relatable to many households here in the United States as many Americans suffer from the outrageous cost of prescriptions.On February 19, 2019, I started the first T1International #insulin4all Chapter in Utah. We advocate for accessible and affordable insulin. T1International is a UK based registered Charity that started the #insulin4all movement and has been leading in patient advocacy since 2013. We currently have 27 Chapters in 30 states with many more on the way. We are a non-profit run by people with type 1 diabetes for people with type 1 diabetes. We support local communities around the world by giving them the tools they need to stand up for their rights for affordable insulin. T1International's aim is to empower advocates to ensure that access to insulin and diabetes supplies becomes a reality for all. Since starting my Utah Chapter in February, I have over 100 Utah Chapter members who want to fight with me for accessible and affordable insulin in Utah. We have many plans to make this a reality in Utah by reaching out to members of Congress and we are very excited as some members of Congress want to work with us.People ask me a lot how I can devote so much time and energy to this cause and my response is, ""How can I not?"" The day our insurance company said my son's one month of insulin was $800.00 until we reached our $5000.00 deductible, I was shocked beyond words. I started fighting for my son that very day because what mom wouldn't? He can't live without affordable insulin, so when lawmakers, greedy big pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies don't care if my son lives or dies, you best bet I will keep fighting even if doors are slammed in my face. My son is the most selfless kind young man there is, and he has a long life ahead of him with this awful disease. I will continue to fight right next to him. I will be a strong voice, so he doesn't have to continue to worry about the cost for the rest of his life. I will keep fighting until changes are made. My husband and two daughters are helping with this fight also. My oldest daughter wrote a beautiful poem to help advocate for her brother. We are doing everything we can to advocate for accessible and affordable insulin. Living with diabetes is tough enough, diabetics shouldn't have to worry how about how they can afford to buy lifesaving medication too. Insulin is life to them like air is to everyone. My fight will continue on.Diabetic Journey: A Family's PerspectiveThe night you were first diagnosed, I will never forget,The color draining from your once vibrant face.One hundred miles per hour moving at a lumbering pace,The beginning of a battle whose victory is yet to be met.A foreign life awaited, not just for you, but for us,Not to mention countless individuals,Pharmaceutical companies and an economy who have lost all of our trust.So many words we had yet to become acquainted with,Diabetes, insulin, A1C, even blood sugar–These are all words that break my heart.There are countless individuals out there who are desperate to find hope,A cure, financial freedom, an easier way to cope.How many deaths and stories does it take to make money hungry professionals filled with greed,Strive to instead offer support so another heart can beat?Yet through it all you still manage to fight,With an aura of positivity and grace,No matter what trials are thrown your way,You always come out triumphant–Our favorite smile lighting up your face.To some it may not seem that great a deal,But put them in your place, your shoes,And see how they would handle surviving every meal.These past three and a half years, we've grown stronger together,Learning countless ways to support and care for one another.Now here we are, striving to make a change,In hopes that others just like you can fight with us, too.Lifesaving medications should not be taken lightly and is not a joke,One shouldn't have to RATION essential needs for their life, for fear of going broke.Your example every day has inspired me to do more than what I've done,To stand up for what I believe in,That together, we can all fight as one.",https://t.co/1H0sqYJzFc,news
Walmart's $25 insulin can't fix the diabetes drug price crisis,"Health care executives faced the ire of lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday, amid a growing outcry from patients who've been forced to ration insulin because of soaring prices.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) told a panel of insulin manufacturers and drug industry intermediaries assembled for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on insulin prices. ""I just want you to know your days are numbered.""While the executives fumbled to explain themselves over the course of two days of questioning, one ""solution"" to the insulin access crisis resurfaced on social media: Patients should just buy cheap insulin at Walmart.For context, the cost of the four most popular insulins has tripled over the past decade, forcing many of the millions of Americans with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who rely on the drug to skimp on or skip doses. Walmart indeed offers a relatively inexpensive choice, essentially over the counter. People can go to pharmacies in stores nationwide and, without a prescription, purchase a vial of Novo Nordisk's Novolin ReliOn Insulin for less than $25. (People with diabetes can require between one and six vials of insulin per month.)But there's a problem here: This low-cost option is far from ideal for all patients. Ultimately, ""Walmart-ism,"" as diabetes advocates call it, reveals a lot about what the debate around the insulin drug pricing crisis has become: a big blame game, filled with distractions from what's really driving up drug prices. The problems with Walmart's insulinDoctors and diabetes advocates point out that while ReliOn may help patients in a pinch, especially those without health insurance, it's also a formulation (known as ""human"" insulin) that came on the market in the 1980s, more than a decade before more refined insulins started to emerge. The newer insulins, known as analogs, appear to be more effective at preventing dangerous blood sugar swings in people with Type 1 diabetes or those at a higher risk for severe low blood sugar. (The evidence of insulin analog's benefits is less clear for Type 2 diabetes, but the studies are also low quality so it's difficult to make conclusive statements.) There's one more problem: Because it's available without a prescription, patients can get the drug without the supervision of a doctor, and they sometimes get into trouble as a result. So stories have surfaced about patients who required emergency care because of severe blood sugar highs and lows after self-dosing with Walmart insulin, or even dying as a result. ""Human insulins are a reasonable option for many patients with Type 2 diabetes,"" said Yale endocrinologist Kasia Lipska, who often prescribes the drugs for patients who can't afford newer formulations. ""But the drug isn't optimal for everybody. And human insulin sold at Walmart is definitely not the solution to our insulin crisis.""For people with Type 1 diabetes, human insulins ""are harder to live on, lead to worse control, make it harder to hold down a job, impact quality of life,"" said James Elliott, a trustee at T1International, an independent patient advocacy group, ""and not everyone lives near a Walmart."" A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the low-cost formulation is also available at CVS and Express Scripps, though patients have to apply for a discount program first. ""We have taken numerous steps to help make insulin more affordable for people living with diabetes,"" the spokesperson said. ""Approximately 775,000 people in the US use our human insulin."" So while it's true that Walmart offers insulin at a competitive price reminiscent of the days before insulin costs tripled and that it can be helpful for some patients, it's not great for everybody with diabetes, and it can be dangerous for some. Walmart-ism is part of the insulin drug pricing blame gameThe Walmart solution first went viral in February, after it was featured on TV in Texas and then posted to Facebook. It continues to be bandied about on social media whenever people mention rising insulin prices. According to the meme, the problem isn't that insulin is too expensive. The problem is that patients are too picky to take advantage of an affordable insulin option. According to the pharmacy benefit managers testifying before Congress Tuesday, it's the insulin manufacturers' companies that are driving up the cost of the drug. At another congressional hearing Wednesday, pharmaceutical company executives blamed pharmacy benefit managers for helping inflate prices and boasted about their financial assistance programs as solutions to the access crisis. The blame game involves many fingers pointing in many directions, but make no mistake: What's driving up insulin costs is that drug companies have raised prices because they can. As I recently explained, the US is an outlier in insulin costs and spending. America represents only 15 percent of the global insulin market and generates almost half of the pharmaceutical industry's insulin revenue. Although insulin was discovered a century ago, manufacturers have made incremental changes to their formulations that have allowed them to extend the patents for these drugs. Even where patents have expired, the road to getting generic insulin on the market is so complicated and expensive that recent attempts have failed.So how did we get here? Unlike other countries, America gives drug companies free rein to set prices. The result is that the cost of the four most popular types of insulin has tripled over the past decade, and the out-of-pocket prescription costs patients now face have doubled. Let's break that down with some dollar figures. By 2016, the average list price of insulin rose to $450 per month. Patients can wind up paying out of pocket anything from $25 per month, if they have generous health insurance coverage or buy older insulin versions at Walmart, to more than $1,000 if they don't have insurance or have a high deductible plan, according to T1International. One quick fix to improve insulin access Lately there's been more attention on the insulin pricing problem. Members of Congress have been pressuring drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers to bring insulin costs under control. Last Wednesday, the insurance behemoth Cigna, and its pharmacy benefit arm Express Scripts, announced a new program that'll cap the 30-day cost of insulin at $25. That's a 40 percent reduction from the $41.50-per-month fee people with Express Scripts benefits were paying in 2018.This week, Sanofi announced it will offer its insulin products at $99 per month for uninsured patients. But like the Walmart option, these programs amount to Band-Aid solutions, said Elizabeth Pfiester, the founder and executive director of T1International. With Walmart, patients are ""having to revert to an older insulin that can damage you,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Sanofi and Cigna programs ""can be shut down or rescinded at any time. That's not any kind of assurance for patients."" ""Patients will not fall for these fake measures that do nothing to solve the crisis we are facing,"" she added.There's one way the insulin drug pricing problem could be fixed, however: lowering the price of insulin, said Yale's Lipska. ""Ultimately, it's the list price that's hurting patients. I keep going back to that: Just fix the list price."" Companies could decide that instead of launching one-off programs or doling out discounts, they'll forgo profits and lower list prices once and for all. Or lawmakers could decide to regulate drug pricing. ""We have a big problem here,"" Lipska said. ""People are hurting and people are dying. How much more will it take for them to regulate this? Clearly what's in place now is not working. This is a place where our legislators can step in and help protect the patients with diabetes."" Update, April 11: We've updated the story with quotes from Novo Nordisk, who responded to our request for comment after the story first published.",https://t.co/LhjWks7ObD,news
INNOVATIVE PILL WHICH RELEASES INSULIN ONCE SWALLOWED IN DEVELOPMENT.,"INNOVATIVE PILL WHICH RELEASES INSULIN ONCE SWALLOWED IN DEVELOPMENT. A pill which can be ingested that will then release insulin into the body automatically, has been developed by a team of researchers from MIT, Harvard and Novo Nordisk (world leaders in insulin production).The pill works by being swallowed by a patient. It is then is transported into the stomach and once there, it attaches itself to the stomach wall where it then automatically injects the drug into the patient's bloodstream. The pill can be customised for each patient and their individual needs. Once the insulin inside the pill has been fully released, the pill then detaches from the patient's stomach and leaves the body as via usual bodily functions.The device features a mechanism which ensures that (once the pill has been swallowed), the injection needle within it, is positioned against the wall of the stomach. The needle protrudes to hold onto the stomach wall where it can access the blood vasculature. Insulin is then delivered once the needle is in place. This kind of therapy eliminates a patient having to administer their medication intravenously: a method which can be painful and uncomfortable for some.At present millions of people worldwide who live with diabetes still have to use the conventional method of injecting insulin to manage their condition. Because insulin is a protein it cannot usually be administered in the form of a conventional pill. There have been options to inhale the drug, but this has not been a technique that has garnered much traction. This new device, therefore, offers an innovative solution to mitigating uncomfortable means to manage diabetes. Currently, testing has only been carried out on pigs, so it is not yet available for mass market release.The research team, however, are now working on how to optimise the pill for human use and are looking into manufacturing methods also. The potential of the device for offering treatment for a variety of conditions outside of diabetes is believed to be huge and some might say it is the ""holy grail"" of medicine.",https://t.co/xnYQiHX16n,news

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/VO1tMeWYmy,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/jwDkZt5Ee0,news

A child with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) successfully treated with the Paleolithic ketogenic diet: A 19-month insulin freedom,"International Journal of Case Reports and Images, Vol. 6 No. 12, December 2015. ISSN – [0976-3198]Int J Case Rep Images 2015;6(12):752–757. www.ijcasereportsandimages.comTóth et al. 753treated with the Paleolithic ketogenic diet. The child has a follow-up of 19 months.CASE REPORTMedical historyThe nine-year-old child had a three-month history of polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue and weight loss. His abdomen was bloated. He had frequent upper respiratory tract infections, epistaxis and eczema on his hands as well as asthma. A laboratory workup on 01 January 2014 showed glucose level of 692 mg/dl and glucose in the urine. A laboratory test on 07 January 2014 showed mild positivity of anti GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies (1280 IU/ml). He was placed on an insulin regime (21 IU daily) with six meals containing 210 g carbohydrate. He was on the conventional insulin therapy for six weeks. Although he strongly adhered to the prescribed diabetes diet his glucose levels fluctuated largely and his complaints (fatigue, eczema, bloated abdomen) persisted too. Therefore, parents of the child sought for alternative treatment options. Paleolithic ketogenic dietWe first met the child and his parents on 13 February 2014. We advised the Paleolithic ketogenic diet consisting of only animal meat, fat, offal and eggs with a fat:protein ratio of about 2:1. Following our advice the child consumed meat, fat and offal only from cattle and pork. He did not consume vegetables and fruits at all. Artificial sweeteners and vegetable oils were excluded. He was allowed to consume small amounts of honey. The diet was introduced gradually within five days. During this time insulin was adjusted according to fingerstick glucose measurements. From the sixth day (from 18 February 2014), the child was on a full Paleolithic ketogenic diet. C-peptide measurement was performed on 13 February 2014 which showed 1.1 ng/ml (normal range: 0.9–7.1 ng/ml). Given that on the Paleolithic ketogenic diet glucose levels were normal both before and after meals insulin was discontinued. The child was advised to eat when hungry. Typically, he had three meals a day. Ketosis was regularly checked by urinary ketone strips which showed sustained ketosis. Food records together with fingerstick glucose were tracked daily. This latter showed normal levels both preprandially and postprandially. For statistical calculations and visualization purposes we selected fingerstick glucose measurements for the meal closest the noon (Figure 1). Glucose levels were significantly lower during the Paleolithic ketogenic diet as compared to the six weeks of the insulin regime both preprandially (Paleolithic ketogenic diet mean: 75.7 mg/dl; insulin regime mean: 146 mg/dl) and postprandially (Paleolithic ketogenic diet mean: 93.7 mg/dl; insulin regime mean: 198.2 mg/dl). Glucose levels showed higher fluctuations during the insulin regime as also shown by larger standard deviation of glucose values on the insulin regime (SD=72 mg/dl) as compared to the Paleolithic ketogenic diet (SD=15.5 mg/dl). Hypoglycemic episodes which were frequent on the standard insulin regime completely disappeared while on the Paleolithic ketogenic diet. Currently, the child is on the Paleolithic ketogenic diet for 19 months without interruption (Figure 1).Laboratory workupLaboratory workups were carried out six times (Table 1). While on the Paleolithic ketogenic diet glucose levels on laboratory tests were between 86 and 130 mg/dl whereas his HgA1c levels were between 5.2 and 5.6%. Cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were slightly elevated. Uric acid was normal. Triglyceride measurements were normal except for elevations on 19 Junuary 2014 and 03 February 2015 which were associated with parent reports of increased food intake. Other laboratory blood parameters were normal. Urinary ketones were positive on each laboratory test. C-peptide measurements indicated 0.7 ng/ml on 15 September 2014 and 0.5 ng/ml on 09 February 2015. Thus measured C-peptide levels seemed to decrease over time. The decrease of C-peptide levels following diagnosis onset is a well-known phenomenon in T1DM and is attributed to the progression of the autoimmune destruction of insulin secreting beta cells [10]. In our case, however, the very low carbohydrate intake might also have resulted in decreased levels of C-peptide. In order to get clues for distinguishing between the two possibilities we measured C-peptide twice two days apart at the same time of the day (in the morning). The first measurement was carried out in fasting (thus after a skipped breakfast) while the second one was carried out following having a usual breakfast. In other words, in the second case we measured a stimulated C-peptide, however, stimulation was done without carbohydrates only using his regular Paleolithic ketogenic diet. Fasting C-peptide on 27 April 2015 was 0.5 ng/ml while 1.2 ng/ml on 29 April 2015 following stimulation (Figure 2). Given that no data are Figure 1: Blood glucose levels while on the standard diabetes diet containing 210 g carbohydrate with insulin therapy (21 IU daily) and while on the Paleolithic ketogenic diet without insulin. For visualization purposes out of the measurements we selected the meal closest to noon. Note normal glucose levels and the absence of large fluctuation in glucose levels following the shift towards the Paleolithic ketogenic diet.",https://t.co/W8vsgGRdF8,news

"With Diabetes, Can Beta Cells Be Resurrected?","Welcome back to our weekly diabetes advice column, Ask D'Mine, hosted by veteran type 1 and diabetes author Wil Dubois in New Mexico. Here, you can ask all the burning questions you may not want to ask your doctor. Today, we're taking a reader question with an interesting tie-in to Easter. {Got your own questions? Email us at AskDMine@diabetesmine.com} Peter, type 1 from New York, writes:So the Easter season got me thinking about resurrection, only in this case—rather than a two-thousand-year-old religious miracle—I'm wondering what hope there is for the resurrection of my (insulin-producing) beta cells. What's the latest on the cure front, Wil?Wil@Ask D'Mine answers: There's a metaphorical Easter Basket full of potential cures. And just like the eggs in the typical basket, each one looks pretty different from the next. Here's a recap of a few of my favorites, just to show you how widely different the colors of possible cures are: The Anti-Diabetes Drug Cocktail This is a holiday weekend, so let's start with a cocktail! And in keeping with the quasi-biblical theme today, this drink is on Mount Sinai Hospital researchers. They've combined two classes of drugs to create a cocktail that induced ""the highest rate of proliferation ever observed in adult human beta cells,"" according toScience Daily. What sort of rate would that be? Well, don't put all your eggs in one basket, but this is looking pretty good: Five to eight percent per day. At that speed it wouldn't take long to re-grow a full complement of beta cells. But, wait, you say. I don't have any beta cells left! How will this super-sizing formula help me? Well, the researchers report that their cocktail works on both normal human beta cells and stem cell-derived human beta cells. Because it's Easter, you can think of a stem cell as a beta cell egg. So if you don't have any beta cells left, a few of these beta cell eggs can be added first, hatched into chicks, and then be turned loose to be fruitful and multiply. So when can we order the cocktail? Well… There are some problems. Apparently, this pair of drugs affect other organs in the body, too, so the Mount Sinai team is trying to figure out how to deliver the cocktail directly to the beta cells. Or maybe they don't have to, because on the other side of the country, the folks at Stanford may have already solved that problem… Using Zinc to Regenerate the PancreasI find this ironic, in that we just covered John Burd's OTC diet supplement with zinc—which he says has the potential to stop type 2 diabetes in its tracks—but zinc is back in the diabetes news again, this time with implications for us type 1s. Instead of a cure-all, however, this time zinc is posed to serve as a unique transport medium to deliver targeted therapy to the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Here's the deal: apparently zinc is like cat nip for beta cells. Yep. They suck up zinc at a rate of 1,000 times more than the surrounding cells. That got Stanford endocrinologist and researcher Justin Annes thinking that zinc could be used to guide targeted regeneration meds to the beta cells. Think of it as the other side of the radioactive iodine coin, where the thyroid's thirst for iodine is used to deliver killing radiation to thyroid tissue to wipe out cancer cells without killing everything else in the neighborhood. And speaking of cancer, Annes' team—who apparently haven't talked to the Mount Sinai team—are now linking the zinc to a cancer drug called JNK inhibitor CC-401, which has been shown to help regenerate beta cells. The zinc is needed because the CC-401, as well as boosting beta cells, apparently flips on the switches of unexpressed genes throughout the body. The scientists dryly say that this could cause serious side effects. I picture Bruce Banner turning into The Incredible Hulk. There's still a long way to go, but the stuff you spray in your throat for the common cold may someday guide beta cell fertilizer to the barren fields of your pancreas.Share on Pinterest Beta Cell ""Seeds"" DiscoveredWhich, of course, brings many of our readers back to bemoaning the crucifixion of all their beta cells by the immune system. What good will fertilizer do if there are no sprouts? There are two things to consider here, and the first is that just like the famous Monty Python ""Bring out your Dead"" scene, maybe not all the beta cells are really dead after all. Or if they are, maybe it doesn't matter as much as we thought, because University of Miami scientists might have just over-turned the last few decades of thinking when it comes to how beta cells grow in humans. They've discovered beta cell seeds in the pancreas, that just need to be watered to grow. Well, OK, they didn't call them seeds. They called them progenitor cells. But you get the idea. A Vaccine to Stop Type 1 DiabetesOr how about, instead of taking three, four, or five shots a day, you just take one and you're done? Actually, this won't work for those of us who already have type 1 diabetes, but as a way to eradicate T1D diabetes going forward, scientists in Stockholm are working on a diabetes vaccine. Hey, it worked for smallpox and polio. In a pilot study by the company Diamyd Medical, their lymph node-injected vaccine Diamyd held 11 out of 12 newly diagnosed type 1s in their honeymoon period for fifteen months by preserving a portion of the endogenous insulin production. More of a partial cure than a full cure, it nonetheless greatly reduced the amount of injected insulin needed to maintain normal blood sugar, and is thus a step in the right direction. A bigger study is underway currently. So how does the vaccine work? It's a so-called ""antigen-specific intralymphatic immunotherapy"" based on the protein GAD65. Sorry you asked, aren't you? It's high-tech bordering on magic, but the vaccine is said to reprogram the immune cells to leave the beta cells quite safe. Right now, it's only being investigated with recently diagnosed type 1s, but I can't help but wonder how it would work as a preventative vaccine for those at high risk. And going forward, there may be a way this vaccine could help those of us who already have T1D. True Pancreatic ResurrectionIn the spirit of Easter, which is a religious holiday marking death and resurrection, we should note that in the diabetes world, there is some evidence that the dead can be raised. I'm talking about the Edmonton Protocol here, where cadaveric pancreatic tissue—that's pancreas parts from recently dead folks—is implanted into the living to continue life. Both the life of the tissue, and of the recipient. And there's more: Like the famous curing touch of you-know-who, these resurrected cells confer a miracle cure to the recipient. The Edmonton Protocol cures type 1 diabetes.Of course, it comes with its own biblical plague of locusts.To keep cells alive in a body that they weren't born into, the recipient has to take powerful anti-rejection drugs. Permanently. And the transplant does nothing to address the underlying (and still not fully understood) causes of type 1 diabetes. There's nothing to prevent a relapse, and in fact, most Edmonton recipients become T1 again down the road.Still, researchers continue to dig into this approach, and if one of the other eggs in the Easter basket—maybe the vaccine, for instance—could be combined with the Edmonton Protocol in the future, our dead beta cells might have the chance to rise again, and stay alive. This is not a medical advice column. We are PWDs freely and openly sharing the wisdom of our collected experiences. We are not MDs, RNs, NPs, PAs, CDEs (or partridges in pear trees). Bottom line: You still need the advice and care of a licensed medical professional.",https://t.co/SXi2UV074f,news

"Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software Defined Radios","Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software DefinedÂ RadiosReverse Engineering an Insulin Pump for DIY Closed Loop TherapyRoughly 3 years ago, I heard about a website offering a bounty for something that was very close to my heart: reverse engineering communications to an insulin pump. My daughter was already using a system that I had helped to create called Loop, with a Medtronic pump that I had reverse engineered the RF comms forÂ¹. But the Medtronic pump required her to disconnect during her gymnastics for hours at a time. The tubeless design of this Omnipod pump sounded great, and I had all the tools to start working on the problem.The Omnipod system consists of a small disposable pump called a pod, and a controlling unit called a PDM.Because the PDM communicates with the pod using radio and the pod has no built in interface, it means the pod is entirely controllable over the radio. There was the potential to create a full integration with Loop using just a RileyLink, or a modified version of it.James Wedding had put up the bounty, and it attracted a lot of attention, and ultimately the right people who would be needed to make progress.Software DefinedÂ RadioSDRs are awesome tools; they make the hidden world of radio visible. There are all kinds of messages zipping by all the time, and these tools let you poke around, see the messages, and with some work, start decoding the little blips you see there. If you're looking for messages from a specific device, you need to know what general area to start looking in. That's where the FCC public filings come in handy.The FCC filing for the PDM, RBV-019, shows that the device transmits in the 433MHz range. Configuring the SDR software to listen in the 433MHz range while issuing a status from the PDM shows comms like this:As I eventually learned, those two bright lines are indicative of a certain type of modulation called frequency shift keying, or FSK. This means that the frequency of the signal varies with the information being transmitted. A 1 bit is sent as a higher frequency (the top line) and a 0 bit is sent with a slightly lower frequency (the bottom line). And using the tool inspectrum we can have it analyze the data to more clearly show the 1's and 0's. Here's a very zoomed in view of that first message above:I ended up writing a python script to extract these bits so we could look at them as a whole packet.It turns out this repeating pattern was part of the preamble. To conserve energy, receivers often have a pattern of sleeping, and waking up periodically to check for a signal. The transmitter sends a preamble long enough to catch the receiver during one of the short listening periods. When the receiver hears the preamble, it stays awake until the real data shows up.There was one more layer we had to get through before we were looking at actual packet data. You can't send your data over the radio exactly as the original bits, because the receiver uses the transitions to synchronize in time when to expect the next bit. If you have a long set of 1's or 0's, the receiver could get out of sync. So radio communications usually use an encoding to make sure there are enough transitions. The Omnipod communications use an encoding called Manchester encoding. Each bit is encoded by two bits. A 1 bit is encoded as 10, and a 0 bit is encoded as 01.This all took a lot of hashing out and there were a lot of theories shared in the openomni slack, as we tried to make getting the raw bits repeatable. Mark Brighton, Dan Caron, and @larsonlr, had been having some success with using RFCat and a TI Stick to capture packets. Evariste Courjaud would eventually write a tool called rtlomni used an rtl-sdr stick to listen for packets and decode them that would prove to be very convenient and more reliable than the TI-Stick based methods.Decoding PacketsOnce we had the actual bits of the packet, we started to look into packet structure. Based on what bits were changing between different pods, and different commands, we pieced together an understanding that looked like this.CRC8Radio is a far from perfect transmission medium. There are many different sources of interference that can make the receiver hear a 1 when a 0 was sent, and vice versa. It's important to know when this has happened, so most protocols use a checksum of sorts, often something called a CRC. The receiver computes the CRC as it receives the data, and the last byte of the packet includes the CRC as the transmitter computed it. If they don't match, the receiver throws the packet away and waits for a retransmission.The Omnipod protocol used a standard 8-bit CRC, so when we found this, we thought we were really close to having the messages figured out. Little did we know…Messages, CRC16Some messages are too big to fit into a single packet, so they are sent as multiple packets. We started to piece together the format of messages, and noticed another set of bits at the end of each message that looked like a 16-bit crc. But it was weird; 5 of the 16 bits were never set. We tried many different techniques to figure out how this was being set, but nothing worked.This was the first big blocker; we could proceed to work out what the other bits in the messages were, but it would be little help to understand what was being sent, but not be able to generate new packets ourselves, and so progress slowed down.Months passed with little progress, and finally in winter of 2016 a member of the group with the handle @lorelai posted that she had sucessfully dumped the firmware from the larger ARM-based chip on the PDM, and started the tedious process of disassembly: taking cpu instructions and turning them into human understandable code with semantic variable and function names. She did an amazing job figuring out what various methods were involved in sending data over the radio.I was looking at one of the unnamed routines, and noticed it looked like a standard implementation of a table based CRC calculation. And the table had the values for a standard 16 bit CRC. I wrote my own implementation using the table, and it checked out like a normal CRC. Then I looked closely at how the function was written. A normal CRC implementation looks like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &lt;&lt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Theirs looked like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Spot the difference? What should've been a bitwise left shift operator had somehow been coded as a right shift. This is a bug; there is no reason to cripple your own CRC algorithm, as it makes it less likely to catch corrupted messages.We were up and running again! We started working on decoding messages, recording sessions from the PDM for delivering boluses, temp basals, suspends, etc…NonceAll of the insulin delivery commands had a 4-byte chunk of data near the beginning of the message that looked like it might be some form of cryptography. Again, we tried many different ways of interpreting it, and analyzing it in the context of the messages it was sent in, but it wasn't a crc (we'd see the same 4 bytes on occasion even when the message data was different). And sometimes we'd see the pattern repeat. It looked maybe this was a bit of the protocol designed to prevent replay of data. Other protocols had features like this, called a nonce.One possible route we had considered was to record a database of messages to replay for given commands. Even if the address of each pod was different, now that we knew how to generate the message crc, we could take a copy of the command we had seen before, put a new address on the message, and recompute the crc. Except this nonce was preventing us from using that strategy. For the next insulin delivery command, no matter what command was sent, the pod would only accept the next nonce in the sequence, and we didn't know how to generate the next nonce.But hey! We have the decompiled PDM firmware now, we can just look there! So we pored over the PDM firmware, and tracked down the message generation in the code, and found where those four bytes should be. But instead of a method computing some cryptographic Nonce, we just found the four characters ""INS.. WTF?!?! Ok, somehow this area of the message must be being updated later in the pipeline.There was another chip on the PDM, closer to the radio. It was the same chip that was used in the Pods, a chip with an identifier of SC9S08ER48, something that wasn't documented online, and was likely produced custom for Insulet. Maybe we could get the firmware off of that chip. Unfortunately, that chip was locked, which prevented dumping of firmware.Again, progress slowed… This felt like a real dead end. We had thrown all our smarts at this nonce, and didn't have any good leads on the math that was behind it. And the ER48 that (possibly) held the secrets was locked and it was hard to find any public details that might help us crack it.X-Ray imagesIn trying to understand more about the ER48, some members of the slack community offered to try to get Xray images, which was really cool, but unfortunately didn't open up any new avenues.Overview XrayDetail XrayDecapping andÂ ImagingDan Caron decided to reach out to a researcher, Dr. Sergei Skorobogatov, at the University of Cambridge in the UK that he had read about who had experience in extracting code from locked chips, and convinced him to take a look at our problem. Dr. Skorobogatov had led research in using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) for chip reverse engineering and suggested it might be possible, but would be expensive, needing access to expensive equipment, and not guaranteed. Joe Moran, who had recently started using Loop after we met at the Fall 2016 Nightscout Hackathon dove in to helping out with this project, and arranged with a bay area company, Nanolab Technologies, to perform the decapping and imaging of the chips, and also graciously funded Nanolab and Dr Skorobogatov's work (and also his personal boxes of pods).Dr. Skorobogatov had Nanolab perform a variety of imaging techniques to ascertain if the protection could be defeated with known non-invasive or semi-invasive methods. This resulted in a lot of images, some of them very beautiful. These are optical microscope pictures of the silicon die.Optical microscope dieÂ overviewOptical microscope dieÂ overviewThere were also images taken of specific areas of the die using scanning electron microscopy. Attempts were made with different voltages, different surface preparations, and different equipment.SEM Image of flash memory cells. Not resolving data.Unfortunately, none of these produced images capable of resolving the actual contents of the flash.Dr. Skorobogatov had one last resort method that was only to be used if these other techniques failed. It was a proprietary method that would have to be given the blessing to be used by the University. Dr. Skorobogatov did an initial test and confirmed that it was capable of resolving the data on this chip. But before we could proceed an NDA had to be agreed upon and so negotiations about who was to be the recipient of the extracted firmware were undertaken.The Nightscout foundation would ultimately be the party signing the NDA and would take the responsibility to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the methods and results of the extraction.The result of this arrangement and work was an incredible paper written by Dr Sergei Skorobogatov, and the raw firmware data. The initial extraction of the firmware had a significant number of errors, but was enough to get started on. Joe asked at the spring Nightscout Foundation Hack if anyone would be up for digging into the disassembly. Nobody raised their hands. Turning the cpu instructions into something understandable is painstaking work, and there are very few people who know how to do it. I tried digging into it, using cpu instruction documentation, but made very little progress, and grew frustrated. Others optimistically asked for request to the firmware with big expectations of fast progress, and then realized the scope and challenge of the task and quietly dropped off.Example disassembly of SC908 instructionsIt turns out Joe also has an extensive background working at the assembly level, and started taking on the onerous task himself. In July, Dr. Skorobogatov had completed a second extraction with much fewer errors. Over the summer Joe Moran worked tirelessly on mapping out the huge amount of cpu instructions, and slowly fitting them together into a larger picture of pod pseudocode.Eventually, Ken Shirriff, an expert in hardware reverse engineering, would join the effort and sped up the process considerably. Together, Joe and Ken eventually mapped out enough code to find the function responsible for coding the nonce September of 2017.RileyLink andÂ LoopWe had been updating the openomni python scripts with our understanding of the comms, but now it was time to start focusing on RileyLink + iOS, so I started work on OmniKit, and firmware updates for the RileyLink. I believed we had the fundamentals of the protocol worked out, and the rest was just details. Again, completely underestimating how much more was ahead of us.I had to write new firmware that would handle the pod modulation and encoding. I also had to rewrite the way the two chips on the RL talked to each other to handle 0's, as 0 was a special end of packet marker for Medtronic. Much in Loop needed to be reworked to support multiple Pumps, and new interfaces made to support pairing, deactivating, and handling faults. Thankfully Nate Racklyeft had set a solid foundation in Loop for this to happen.Meanwhile, work on understanding the format of the commands continued and was documented thoroughly on the openomni wiki, which is the most comprehensive documentation on the pod protocol published publicly. Joe, Evariste, and Eelke Jager really did a massive amount of work decoding messages, and updating the pages over time. Various members of the slack channel have contributed captures of PDM to Pod communications to aid decoding efforts.The decoding was fun work, with lots of small wins as each component of each command is deciphered, and I really enjoyed working on this part, and adding code to Loop to implement. In April of 2018 I shared on slack that I had ""paired via iPhone + RL, primed, cannula insertion, basal schedule programmed, and then bolused 5U.The 2.0 RL firmware was finished in July of 2018, and new shipments started including it. It was hoped that these boards would be able to be used with Loop and Omnipod, but the existing 915 MHz antenna would prove to be too poor to do 433 MHz comms effectively.Decoding and implementation was progressed well over the summer, and the Loop experience was coming together. Joe did an amazing thing in providing funding for me to quit my day job, and focus more on this project, and to eventually join the wonderful Tidepool team. There were of course more events happening outside of the omnipod RE story in the DIY and regulator spaces that I won't cover, but it was a very interesting summer!ScreamersAs more functionality came online in the driver, I started hooking it up into Loop, including the ability to automatically adjust delivery by temp basals. At this point it was fairly common to get a screaming pod, which meant some of the pod's internal checking had detected a situation where it decided there was a problem and it should not continue to deliver insulin.But it seemed like a workable problem, as we continued to find small discrepancies in what Loop was sending versus what the PDM would send if the command was delivered manually, and I assumed if we fixed all of those that the screaming would stop.Looping!On October 3, 2018, Joe put a Loop controlled pod on himself and became the first Loop Omnipod user, but didn't tell me immediately as he knew I'd be worrying. When he did tell me, I still worried. We had seen the pod work, and understood the functionality, and the basic algorithm of Loop had been vetted for a long time, but still…A month later, at the November 2018 Nightscout Hackathon, a few more adventurous souls opted try it out for themselves as well, and became part of a small private testing group that would grow to over 30 people before the branch was made public.Unfortunately, we still had screamers often happening before the full 3 days of use were finished, and we had meticulously compared Loop's commands to PDM reference versions. Eelke was particularly helpful with this process, creating a script that could check commands against their reference versions automatically. I started to get worried that the increased demands on the battery for doing communication every five minutes had pushed the pod over the edge of what was sustainable.Pod voltage taps, drilled through back plastic, super-glued inÂ place.So I started measuring pod voltage with an arduino, recording the data and storing it a local database for visualization. Comparing PDM and Loop.Long time scale view of podÂ voltage.Unfortunately, this proved to be a dead end as well; using a PDM and bolusing large amounts, I could drive the pod to lower voltages than even Loop would do over the life of a looping pod, and wasn't able to make the pod scream. It seemed like voltage wasn't the issue, so there must be something else.RileyLinks with 955 MHz (left) and coil 433 MHz (right)Â antennasAt one point I noticed that if a message exchange with the pod failed, the pod would sometimes be left in a state of trying to complete the exchange by re-sending packets over and over and over. Testers logs were also showing lots of failures, and so I started experimenting with antennas. Both of these problems should be improved with better comms. I had planned on trying different antennas and had ordered from random places on the internet, but hadn't had time to try them until it became a priority.I had some flexible 433 MHz antennas that could be taped on the inside of the RL case. These would often have great performance in some scenarios, but not in others; it was too unreliable. When I got to the coil based one, it had good performance very consistently, and at very surprising ranges. Time for a new RileyLink case.With the new antenna, and some optimizations to do fewer message exchanges while still allowing adjustments every 5 minutes, the frequency of screamers went down to a very low rate. Likely comparable to using a pod normally with a PDM. In the most recent 7,500 hours of live testing, 94% of pods completed without faults.Testing and DocumentationThe testing group grew slowly, which was a great way to continually get new eyes on the system and see what parts were confusing. These testers put up with a lot of screaming pods, and contributed in very big ways to making Loop with Omnipod work better. They did this primarily by sharing issue reports from each of their pods, whether successful or not.The issue reports have a message log in them that could be analyzed by the tool that Eelke built, giving us insight into whether we had any misformatted commands and also let us gather statistics around certain parts of Loop's interaction with the pods.Marion Barker joined the testing group and added dedicated reporting, and additional statistics to the progress of testing, and we were able to use her stats of successful pods vs failures to have a high level view of progress.Eventually Katie DiSimone joined the testing group, and started a large restructuring of loopdocs.org to provide documentation for using Loop with multiple devices. The anticipation around a version of Loop that worked with Omnipod was incredibly high, and without good documentation, it was certain that we'd be flooded with the same questions over and over.New Features ForÂ LoopOmnipod integration required rethinking of some interface elements, and adding new controls. The pod doesn't report battery, and there is little a user can do about a low battery if one were to somehow happen, so displaying a battery level widget didn't make sense. Also, without a UI on the pump, the user needs to be able to cancel a bolus quickly. The reservoir icon was a picture of a Medtronic reservoir, so we wanted to rethink that. Thank you to Paul Forgione for designing the pod logo that now shows reservoir level.ThanksThank you to all the people who help make this long road come to a place where we can share this with others, and realize the goal that we set out to do a long time ago. I know I didn't cover everyone, and everything that happened. That would be impossible in a single post, and for me, since I only have my experience through this. It's hard to imagine the total hours put into this. If you could add them all up, I'm sure it would be shocking. Not to mention the work that has gone into making the Omnipod itself, which I imagine dwarfs this effort. So thank you *all*. Also, many of those hours would otherwise have been spent with families. I really appreciate my wife and kids being understanding with the time I've spent on this, and want to thank them too.SidenotesI have to mention Joakim Ornstedt, as one of the contributors to openomni decoding, and also the creator of what is probably actually the first looping integration with omnipod. He built a device that used optical character recognition (OCR) on the PDM to get data from the PDM, and wired in digital button presses to the PDM through another microcontroller. It's a hard to scale approach, but very clever, and bypasses a lot of the issues we had to deal with for an RE based solution. I really admired him for pulling this off, and getting looping in a tiny fraction of the time it took to make it work with Loop.",https://t.co/EY1jdi6NtJ,news
What Would You Say About A Nation That Lets The Poor Die From Diabetes?,"In the early 1920s, researchers at the University of Toronto discovered a way to extract insulin that would prove life-saving for individuals essentially waiting to die after a Type 1 diabetes diagnosis, and those researchers sold the patent for just $1 to the university to ensure all could have access to the treatment.Fast forward to the present and Americans are dying from Type 1 diabetes — not for lack of a cure but lack of the funds to obtain it.Via NPR:Diabetic ketoacidosis is a terrible way to die. It's what happens when you don't have enough insulin. Your blood sugar gets so high that your blood becomes highly acidic, your cells dehydrate, and your body stops functioning.Diabetic ketoacidosis is how Nicole Smith-Holt lost her son. Three days before his payday. Because he couldn't afford his insulin.""It shouldn't have happened,"" Smith-Holt says looking at her son's death certificate on her dining room table in Richfield, Minn. ""That cause of death of diabetic ketoacidosis should have never happened.""Since 2012, the price of insulin has more than doubled, leaving those with the least resources struggling to obtain the treatment they need to stay alive.And when they lose the financial struggle? That can mean loss of life.Most people's bodies create insulin, which regulates the amount of sugar in the blood. In the U.S., the roughly 1.25 million of us with Type 1 diabetes have to buy insulin at a pharmacy because our pancreases stopped producing it.My first vial of insulin cost $24.56 in 2011, after insurance. Seven years later, I pay more than $80.Alec was facing a monthly expense of $1,300 to maintain his insulin treatments after losing insurance through his mother's plan once he turned 26.Alec's yearly salary as a restaurant manager was about $35,000. Too high to qualify for Medicaid and, Smith-Holt says, too high to qualify for subsidies in Minnesota's health insurance marketplace. The plan they found had a $450 premium each month and an annual deductible of $7,600.""At first, he didn't realize what a deductible was,"" Smith-Holt says. She says Alec figured he could pick up a part-time job to help cover the $450 per month.…""You have to pay the $7,600 out of pocket before your insurance is even going to kick in,"" she remembers telling him. Alec decided going uninsured would be more manageable.But determining his next best step would never happen: Alec died less than one month after being booted from his mother's insurance plan.His family thinks he was rationing his insulin — using less than he needed — to try to make it last until he could afford to buy more. He died alone in his apartment three days before payday. The insulin pen he used to give himself shots was empty.Trying to determine why the cost of insulin has risen so dramatically is tricky; everyone seems to have a different answer to the question.Some blame middlemen — such as pharmacy benefit managers, like Express Scripts and CVS Health — for negotiating lower prices with pharmaceutical companies without passing savings on to customers. Others say patents on incremental changes to insulin have kept cheaper generic versions out of the market.For Nicole Holt-Smith, as well as a growing number of online activists who tweet under the hashtag #insulin4all, much of the blame should fall on the three main manufacturers of insulin today: Sanofi of France, Novo Nordisk of Denmark and Eli Lilly and Co. in the U.S.All three companies are currently being sued by diabetic patients in Massachusetts, facing allegations that rising prices come at the expense of people's health and lives.[An Eli Lilly] company spokesman noted in an email that high-deductible health insurance plans — like the one Alec found — are exposing more patients to higher prices. In August, Eli Lilly opened a help line that patients can call for assistance in finding discounted or even free insulin.Nicole Holt-Smith is working to make change so other Americans will not suffer the fate of her son:""My story is not so different from what I hear from other families,"" Smith-Holt recently told a panel of U.S. Senate Democrats in Washington D.C., in a hearing on the high price of prescription drugs.""Young adults are dropping out of college,"" she told the lawmakers. ""They're getting married just to have insurance or not getting married to the love of their lives because they'll lose their state-funded insurance.""Read more here.",https://t.co/es1ocqComO,news
8 Reasons Why Insulin is so Outrageously Expensive,"Why does insulin cost so much to patients in the USA and around the world? Why is insulin, a widely sold drug of which most forms are now off-patent, so incredibly expensive? These are simple questions, but ones with a number of complicated answers. This post will break some of those answers down and point you in the direction further reading if you want to dive deeper.1. Only 3 Companies Control 90% of the Global Insulin Market The 'big three' insulin producers – Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi – dominate more than 90% of the world insulin market by value. Often only one of these companies supplies insulin in a country, which means they more or less hold a monopoly there and can set prices as they wish. In some countries, notably China and India, there are domestic insulin companies that can help drive down the price. This means we need more companies in markets like the USA to help bring prices down. We'll touch on that a bit further down the list. 2. No Generic InsulinWhen it comes to the question of generic insulin, we are faced with another complicated issue. Insulin is a therapeutic biological product (or 'biologic'), rather than a chemically synthesized molecule. This means it cannot be made as generic in the same way as other drugs. Creating what is called a biosimilar is a lot more complicated and expensive than just duplicating a chemical molecule. There is little market incentive to produce biosimiliars because it costs nearly as much as making new drug, and companies must go through all the approval stages and trials that a new drug is required to go through. Not to mention, current biosimilar insulins on the market – primarily produced by the 'big three' – have only reduced the price by about 10-15%. For more on biosimilars and the 2018 FDA announcement read this and this.3. Pay-for-Delay Schemes &amp; LawsuitsA 'Pay for delay' agreement is a patent dispute settlement in which a generic (in the case of insulin, a biosimilar) manufacturer acknowledges the original patent of a pharmaceutical company and agrees to refrain from marketing its product for a specific period of time. In return, the company receives a payment from the patent-holder. This means it is actually legal for one insulin producer to pay another one not to enter the market. A few years ago the company Merck announced plans to sell a biosimilar version of Sanofi's Lantus. Sanofi sued, and eventually Merck announced that it was no longer pursuing it's biosimilar, presumably due to payments from Sanofi to stay away. If Pay for delay schemes don't work, the 'big three' can still sue other players, prolonging processes and pushing players out of the market because of legal fees and time-wasting. All of these are win-wins for companies, and lose-lose for patients.4. Patents Why aren't we seeing more companies making insulin? There are many reasons for this, but patent evergreening is a big one. Patents give a person or organization a monopoly on a particular invention for a specific period of time. In the USA, it is generally 20 years. Humalog, Lantus and other previous generation insulins are now off patent, as are even older animal based insulins. So what's going on? Pharmaceutical companies take advantage of loopholes in the U.S. patent system to build thickets of patents around their drugs which will make them last much longer (evergreening). This prevents competition and can keep prices high for decades. Our friends at I-MAK recently showed that Sanofi, the maker of Lantus, is no exception. Sanofi has filed 74 patent applications on Lantus alone, that means Sanofi has created the potential for a competition-free monopoly for 37 years. 5. PoliticsCompanies are not in the habit of throwing money away, and they are not in the habit of staying out of politics. Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi collectively rake in several billions of dollars in profits. That's not millions, but billions – with a B. We know they spend millions on marketing, but they also spend millions on lobbying politicians and donating to our decision-makers so that they keep quiet about price gouging. Check if your representatives receive contributions from one of the 'big three' insulin manufacturers or any pharmaceutical company. Chances are, they do. Not to mention, the revolving door between pharma companies and US Government positions. Our current secretary of Health and Human Services was previously an Eli Lilly executive. Obviously, his interests are not with people, but with power. This is why independent patient voices are so important.6. Price FixingThese Business Insider graphs pretty much say it all. Several lawsuits alleging some form price-fixing are currently in the works. You can read more here and here.7. Pharma Marketing SchemesPhysicians in the United States and some other countries are allowed to collect fees from pharmaceutical companies for talks, advice, and more. Supposedly, these are to compensate physicians for their expertise and time. However, they can create loyalty to a company and may influence prescribing habits – a belief shared by some pharmaceutical salespeople. In some countries like India, physicians are allowed to sell and profit off insulin directly through patients, or through pharmacies they themselves own, cutting out middlemen and the retail pharmacies. Thus, they lose the incentive to find the lowest price insulin for their patients. Insulin companies also focus on 'insulin-starts', or the insulin the physician diagnosing patients begins with. As patients are reluctant to change, a number of marketing and financial incentives are employed to influence this decision.8. Payment for Influence (or Silence)Many major key opinion leaders, influencers, and patient advocacy organizations take pharma cash. For example, the two biggest diabetes organizations – The American Diabetes Association and The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation – have accepted huge sums from insulin manufacturers. Other groups were actually created by money from the 'big three', like the World Diabetes Foundation which is funded by Novo Nordisk, and other supposed advocacy groups that are actually doing pharma's bidding, or at least are highly influenced by them. If this issue is important to you, check the funders of an organization you want to support, and if it's not transparent, you can ask if they take industry money.What Can be Done?Patients are speaking out about these issues all around the world. In the USA where prices have skyrocketed especially, T1International Chapters are being formed where patient advocates are educating and pushing for policy change. You can learn more about Chapter here and find more information and action related to the insulin price crisis here. Whatever you do, wherever you are – don't stay silent.",https://t.co/HlhtHZ6D6m,news
"Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software Defined Radios","Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software DefinedÂ RadiosReverse Engineering an Insulin Pump for DIY Closed Loop TherapyRoughly 3 years ago, I heard about a website offering a bounty for something that was very close to my heart: reverse engineering communications to an insulin pump. My daughter was already using a system that I had helped to create called Loop, with a Medtronic pump that I had reverse engineered the RF comms forÂ¹. But the Medtronic pump required her to disconnect during her gymnastics for hours at a time. The tubeless design of this Omnipod pump sounded great, and I had all the tools to start working on the problem.The Omnipod system consists of a small disposable pump called a pod, and a controlling unit called a PDM.Because the PDM communicates with the pod using radio and the pod has no built in interface, it means the pod is entirely controllable over the radio. There was the potential to create a full integration with Loop using just a RileyLink, or a modified version of it.James Wedding had put up the bounty, and it attracted a lot of attention, and ultimately the right people who would be needed to make progress.Software DefinedÂ RadioSDRs are awesome tools; they make the hidden world of radio visible. There are all kinds of messages zipping by all the time, and these tools let you poke around, see the messages, and with some work, start decoding the little blips you see there. If you're looking for messages from a specific device, you need to know what general area to start looking in. That's where the FCC public filings come in handy.The FCC filing for the PDM, RBV-019, shows that the device transmits in the 433MHz range. Configuring the SDR software to listen in the 433MHz range while issuing a status from the PDM shows comms like this:As I eventually learned, those two bright lines are indicative of a certain type of modulation called frequency shift keying, or FSK. This means that the frequency of the signal varies with the information being transmitted. A 1 bit is sent as a higher frequency (the top line) and a 0 bit is sent with a slightly lower frequency (the bottom line). And using the tool inspectrum we can have it analyze the data to more clearly show the 1's and 0's. Here's a very zoomed in view of that first message above:I ended up writing a python script to extract these bits so we could look at them as a whole packet.It turns out this repeating pattern was part of the preamble. To conserve energy, receivers often have a pattern of sleeping, and waking up periodically to check for a signal. The transmitter sends a preamble long enough to catch the receiver during one of the short listening periods. When the receiver hears the preamble, it stays awake until the real data shows up.There was one more layer we had to get through before we were looking at actual packet data. You can't send your data over the radio exactly as the original bits, because the receiver uses the transitions to synchronize in time when to expect the next bit. If you have a long set of 1's or 0's, the receiver could get out of sync. So radio communications usually use an encoding to make sure there are enough transitions. The Omnipod communications use an encoding called Manchester encoding. Each bit is encoded by two bits. A 1 bit is encoded as 10, and a 0 bit is encoded as 01.This all took a lot of hashing out and there were a lot of theories shared in the openomni slack, as we tried to make getting the raw bits repeatable. Mark Brighton, Dan Caron, and @larsonlr, had been having some success with using RFCat and a TI Stick to capture packets. Evariste Courjaud would eventually write a tool called rtlomni used an rtl-sdr stick to listen for packets and decode them that would prove to be very convenient and more reliable than the TI-Stick based methods.Decoding PacketsOnce we had the actual bits of the packet, we started to look into packet structure. Based on what bits were changing between different pods, and different commands, we pieced together an understanding that looked like this.CRC8Radio is a far from perfect transmission medium. There are many different sources of interference that can make the receiver hear a 1 when a 0 was sent, and vice versa. It's important to know when this has happened, so most protocols use a checksum of sorts, often something called a CRC. The receiver computes the CRC as it receives the data, and the last byte of the packet includes the CRC as the transmitter computed it. If they don't match, the receiver throws the packet away and waits for a retransmission.The Omnipod protocol used a standard 8-bit CRC, so when we found this, we thought we were really close to having the messages figured out. Little did we know…Messages, CRC16Some messages are too big to fit into a single packet, so they are sent as multiple packets. We started to piece together the format of messages, and noticed another set of bits at the end of each message that looked like a 16-bit crc. But it was weird; 5 of the 16 bits were never set. We tried many different techniques to figure out how this was being set, but nothing worked.This was the first big blocker; we could proceed to work out what the other bits in the messages were, but it would be little help to understand what was being sent, but not be able to generate new packets ourselves, and so progress slowed down.Months passed with little progress, and finally in winter of 2016 a member of the group with the handle @lorelai posted that she had sucessfully dumped the firmware from the larger ARM-based chip on the PDM, and started the tedious process of disassembly: taking cpu instructions and turning them into human understandable code with semantic variable and function names. She did an amazing job figuring out what various methods were involved in sending data over the radio.I was looking at one of the unnamed routines, and noticed it looked like a standard implementation of a table based CRC calculation. And the table had the values for a standard 16 bit CRC. I wrote my own implementation using the table, and it checked out like a normal CRC. Then I looked closely at how the function was written. A normal CRC implementation looks like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &lt;&lt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Theirs looked like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Spot the difference? What should've been a bitwise left shift operator had somehow been coded as a right shift. This is a bug; there is no reason to cripple your own CRC algorithm, as it makes it less likely to catch corrupted messages.We were up and running again! We started working on decoding messages, recording sessions from the PDM for delivering boluses, temp basals, suspends, etc…NonceAll of the insulin delivery commands had a 4-byte chunk of data near the beginning of the message that looked like it might be some form of cryptography. Again, we tried many different ways of interpreting it, and analyzing it in the context of the messages it was sent in, but it wasn't a crc (we'd see the same 4 bytes on occasion even when the message data was different). And sometimes we'd see the pattern repeat. It looked maybe this was a bit of the protocol designed to prevent replay of data. Other protocols had features like this, called a nonce.One possible route we had considered was to record a database of messages to replay for given commands. Even if the address of each pod was different, now that we knew how to generate the message crc, we could take a copy of the command we had seen before, put a new address on the message, and recompute the crc. Except this nonce was preventing us from using that strategy. For the next insulin delivery command, no matter what command was sent, the pod would only accept the next nonce in the sequence, and we didn't know how to generate the next nonce.But hey! We have the decompiled PDM firmware now, we can just look there! So we pored over the PDM firmware, and tracked down the message generation in the code, and found where those four bytes should be. But instead of a method computing some cryptographic Nonce, we just found the four characters ""INS.. WTF?!?! Ok, somehow this area of the message must be being updated later in the pipeline.There was another chip on the PDM, closer to the radio. It was the same chip that was used in the Pods, a chip with an identifier of SC9S08ER48, something that wasn't documented online, and was likely produced custom for Insulet. Maybe we could get the firmware off of that chip. Unfortunately, that chip was locked, which prevented dumping of firmware.Again, progress slowed… This felt like a real dead end. We had thrown all our smarts at this nonce, and didn't have any good leads on the math that was behind it. And the ER48 that (possibly) held the secrets was locked and it was hard to find any public details that might help us crack it.X-Ray imagesIn trying to understand more about the ER48, some members of the slack community offered to try to get Xray images, which was really cool, but unfortunately didn't open up any new avenues.Overview XrayDetail XrayDecapping andÂ ImagingDan Caron decided to reach out to a researcher, Dr. Sergei Skorobogatov, at the University of Cambridge in the UK that he had read about who had experience in extracting code from locked chips, and convinced him to take a look at our problem. Dr. Skorobogatov had led research in using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) for chip reverse engineering and suggested it might be possible, but would be expensive, needing access to expensive equipment, and not guaranteed. Joe Moran, who had recently started using Loop after we met at the Fall 2016 Nightscout Hackathon dove in to helping out with this project, and arranged with a bay area company, Nanolab Technologies, to perform the decapping and imaging of the chips, and also graciously funded Nanolab and Dr Skorobogatov's work (and also his personal boxes of pods).Dr. Skorobogatov had Nanolab perform a variety of imaging techniques to ascertain if the protection could be defeated with known non-invasive or semi-invasive methods. This resulted in a lot of images, some of them very beautiful. These are optical microscope pictures of the silicon die.Optical microscope dieÂ overviewOptical microscope dieÂ overviewThere were also images taken of specific areas of the die using scanning electron microscopy. Attempts were made with different voltages, different surface preparations, and different equipment.SEM Image of flash memory cells. Not resolving data.Unfortunately, none of these produced images capable of resolving the actual contents of the flash.Dr. Skorobogatov had one last resort method that was only to be used if these other techniques failed. It was a proprietary method that would have to be given the blessing to be used by the University. Dr. Skorobogatov did an initial test and confirmed that it was capable of resolving the data on this chip. But before we could proceed an NDA had to be agreed upon and so negotiations about who was to be the recipient of the extracted firmware were undertaken.The Nightscout foundation would ultimately be the party signing the NDA and would take the responsibility to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the methods and results of the extraction.The result of this arrangement and work was an incredible paper written by Dr Sergei Skorobogatov, and the raw firmware data. The initial extraction of the firmware had a significant number of errors, but was enough to get started on. Joe asked at the spring Nightscout Foundation Hack if anyone would be up for digging into the disassembly. Nobody raised their hands. Turning the cpu instructions into something understandable is painstaking work, and there are very few people who know how to do it. I tried digging into it, using cpu instruction documentation, but made very little progress, and grew frustrated. Others optimistically asked for request to the firmware with big expectations of fast progress, and then realized the scope and challenge of the task and quietly dropped off.Example disassembly of SC908 instructionsIt turns out Joe also has an extensive background working at the assembly level, and started taking on the onerous task himself. In July, Dr. Skorobogatov had completed a second extraction with much fewer errors. Over the summer Joe Moran worked tirelessly on mapping out the huge amount of cpu instructions, and slowly fitting them together into a larger picture of pod pseudocode.Eventually, Ken Shirriff, an expert in hardware reverse engineering, would join the effort and sped up the process considerably. Together, Joe and Ken eventually mapped out enough code to find the function responsible for coding the nonce September of 2017.RileyLink andÂ LoopWe had been updating the openomni python scripts with our understanding of the comms, but now it was time to start focusing on RileyLink + iOS, so I started work on OmniKit, and firmware updates for the RileyLink. I believed we had the fundamentals of the protocol worked out, and the rest was just details. Again, completely underestimating how much more was ahead of us.I had to write new firmware that would handle the pod modulation and encoding. I also had to rewrite the way the two chips on the RL talked to each other to handle 0's, as 0 was a special end of packet marker for Medtronic. Much in Loop needed to be reworked to support multiple Pumps, and new interfaces made to support pairing, deactivating, and handling faults. Thankfully Nate Racklyeft had set a solid foundation in Loop for this to happen.Meanwhile, work on understanding the format of the commands continued and was documented thoroughly on the openomni wiki, which is the most comprehensive documentation on the pod protocol published publicly. Joe, Evariste, and Eelke Jager really did a massive amount of work decoding messages, and updating the pages over time. Various members of the slack channel have contributed captures of PDM to Pod communications to aid decoding efforts.The decoding was fun work, with lots of small wins as each component of each command is deciphered, and I really enjoyed working on this part, and adding code to Loop to implement. In April of 2018 I shared on slack that I had ""paired via iPhone + RL, primed, cannula insertion, basal schedule programmed, and then bolused 5U.The 2.0 RL firmware was finished in July of 2018, and new shipments started including it. It was hoped that these boards would be able to be used with Loop and Omnipod, but the existing 915 MHz antenna would prove to be too poor to do 433 MHz comms effectively.Decoding and implementation was progressed well over the summer, and the Loop experience was coming together. Joe did an amazing thing in providing funding for me to quit my day job, and focus more on this project, and to eventually join the wonderful Tidepool team. There were of course more events happening outside of the omnipod RE story in the DIY and regulator spaces that I won't cover, but it was a very interesting summer!ScreamersAs more functionality came online in the driver, I started hooking it up into Loop, including the ability to automatically adjust delivery by temp basals. At this point it was fairly common to get a screaming pod, which meant some of the pod's internal checking had detected a situation where it decided there was a problem and it should not continue to deliver insulin.But it seemed like a workable problem, as we continued to find small discrepancies in what Loop was sending versus what the PDM would send if the command was delivered manually, and I assumed if we fixed all of those that the screaming would stop.Looping!On October 3, 2018, Joe put a Loop controlled pod on himself and became the first Loop Omnipod user, but didn't tell me immediately as he knew I'd be worrying. When he did tell me, I still worried. We had seen the pod work, and understood the functionality, and the basic algorithm of Loop had been vetted for a long time, but still…A month later, at the November 2018 Nightscout Hackathon, a few more adventurous souls opted try it out for themselves as well, and became part of a small private testing group that would grow to over 30 people before the branch was made public.Unfortunately, we still had screamers often happening before the full 3 days of use were finished, and we had meticulously compared Loop's commands to PDM reference versions. Eelke was particularly helpful with this process, creating a script that could check commands against their reference versions automatically. I started to get worried that the increased demands on the battery for doing communication every five minutes had pushed the pod over the edge of what was sustainable.Pod voltage taps, drilled through back plastic, super-glued inÂ place.So I started measuring pod voltage with an arduino, recording the data and storing it a local database for visualization. Comparing PDM and Loop.Long time scale view of podÂ voltage.Unfortunately, this proved to be a dead end as well; using a PDM and bolusing large amounts, I could drive the pod to lower voltages than even Loop would do over the life of a looping pod, and wasn't able to make the pod scream. It seemed like voltage wasn't the issue, so there must be something else.RileyLinks with 955 MHz (left) and coil 433 MHz (right)Â antennasAt one point I noticed that if a message exchange with the pod failed, the pod would sometimes be left in a state of trying to complete the exchange by re-sending packets over and over and over. Testers logs were also showing lots of failures, and so I started experimenting with antennas. Both of these problems should be improved with better comms. I had planned on trying different antennas and had ordered from random places on the internet, but hadn't had time to try them until it became a priority.I had some flexible 433 MHz antennas that could be taped on the inside of the RL case. These would often have great performance in some scenarios, but not in others; it was too unreliable. When I got to the coil based one, it had good performance very consistently, and at very surprising ranges. Time for a new RileyLink case.With the new antenna, and some optimizations to do fewer message exchanges while still allowing adjustments every 5 minutes, the frequency of screamers went down to a very low rate. Likely comparable to using a pod normally with a PDM. In the most recent 7,500 hours of live testing, 94% of pods completed without faults.Testing and DocumentationThe testing group grew slowly, which was a great way to continually get new eyes on the system and see what parts were confusing. These testers put up with a lot of screaming pods, and contributed in very big ways to making Loop with Omnipod work better. They did this primarily by sharing issue reports from each of their pods, whether successful or not.The issue reports have a message log in them that could be analyzed by the tool that Eelke built, giving us insight into whether we had any misformatted commands and also let us gather statistics around certain parts of Loop's interaction with the pods.Marion Barker joined the testing group and added dedicated reporting, and additional statistics to the progress of testing, and we were able to use her stats of successful pods vs failures to have a high level view of progress.Eventually Katie DiSimone joined the testing group, and started a large restructuring of loopdocs.org to provide documentation for using Loop with multiple devices. The anticipation around a version of Loop that worked with Omnipod was incredibly high, and without good documentation, it was certain that we'd be flooded with the same questions over and over.New Features ForÂ LoopOmnipod integration required rethinking of some interface elements, and adding new controls. The pod doesn't report battery, and there is little a user can do about a low battery if one were to somehow happen, so displaying a battery level widget didn't make sense. Also, without a UI on the pump, the user needs to be able to cancel a bolus quickly. The reservoir icon was a picture of a Medtronic reservoir, so we wanted to rethink that. Thank you to Paul Forgione for designing the pod logo that now shows reservoir level.ThanksThank you to all the people who help make this long road come to a place where we can share this with others, and realize the goal that we set out to do a long time ago. I know I didn't cover everyone, and everything that happened. That would be impossible in a single post, and for me, since I only have my experience through this. It's hard to imagine the total hours put into this. If you could add them all up, I'm sure it would be shocking. Not to mention the work that has gone into making the Omnipod itself, which I imagine dwarfs this effort. So thank you *all*. Also, many of those hours would otherwise have been spent with families. I really appreciate my wife and kids being understanding with the time I've spent on this, and want to thank them too.SidenotesI have to mention Joakim Ornstedt, as one of the contributors to openomni decoding, and also the creator of what is probably actually the first looping integration with omnipod. He built a device that used optical character recognition (OCR) on the PDM to get data from the PDM, and wired in digital button presses to the PDM through another microcontroller. It's a hard to scale approach, but very clever, and bypasses a lot of the issues we had to deal with for an RE based solution. I really admired him for pulling this off, and getting looping in a tiny fraction of the time it took to make it work with Loop.",https://t.co/qJRnhykxTR,news
Americans are dying because they can't afford their insulin. That's now a 2020 campaign issue.,"Once a month, Sarah Stark makes the trip to her local pharmacy to pick up the insulin she needs to keep her diabetes in check. She has health insurance through her job and uses a $100 manufacturer's coupon to help defray the cost. Even so, she ends up paying a whopping $728.40.Stark, 28, is not the only one to experience sticker shock when making the purchase. Invariably, the pharmacist who rings her up is taken aback by the price of the medication, and asks if she's certain she wants to complete the purchase. Not that Stark really has a choice. She's a a type 1 diabetic who has had the ailment since childhood. She's willing to pay the price for her daily dose of insulin, even though it poses financial hardship.""Those out of pocket costs add up,"" Stark said during a recent interview with ThinkProgress. ""Not a lot of people could afford that co-pay… and I've seen them have to walk away.""The issue is a matter of life and death — and it's one Stark says deeply informs the choices she makes at the ballot box. ""I one hundred percent vote with my pancreas,"" she said. ""One of my values is that health is a human right. I'm not interested in a candidate who doesn't feel that way.""Insulin pricing may seem like a niche issue, but it's one that affects millions of people across the country. As the 2020 Democratic primary field grows, a few candidates have latched onto the rapidly spiraling price of the medication as a campaign issue, revealing the range of ideas in the party for addressing monopolies and reforming the health care system.More than 30 million people in the United States have diabetes and as of last year, an estimated 7.4 million people like Stark used insulin daily, according to the American Diabetes Association. Without her insurance and the manufacturer's coupon, Stark's insulin would cost about $1,005, so Stark has it easier than some diabetics, 3 percent of whom, according to the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, have no health coverage at all.In recent years, insulin prices have skyrocketed, according to figures compiled by the Senate Finance Committee, which is investigating possible price gouging in the industry.Between 2001 and 2005, Eli Lilly's Humalog increased from $35 to $234, a 585 percent increase, the Senate panel found.Novo Nordisk's Novolog rose from $289 in 2013 to to $540 in 2019, an 87 percent increase. Sanofi's Lantus, meanwhile, increased in price from $244 to $431 between 2013 and 2019, an approximately 77 percent increase.""Drug companies in general have figured out how to price better from a profit-making perspective,"" Columbia University economist Bhaven Sampat explained. ""They've gotten more sophisticated about finding the maximum price the market can bear and gotten less bashful about it.""That, coupled with the fact that generic versions of a drug cannot be made until the original patent expires — which hasn't happened for insulin yet — has helped create conditions for a system that requires people like Stark to fork over hundreds of dollars each month just to remain healthy.Apparently sensing rising fury from consumers, Eli Lilly recently announced it would offer a half-price version of Humalog. The new drug however would cost $137 a vial, a price that is still unconscionably high, said Christel Aprigliano, CEO of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition (DPAC).""It's not sustainable,"" Aprigliano told ThinkProgress. ""It truly has become a perverted system in which the list price of a drug that is life essential for 8 million Americans just has become unaffordable… [and] the people who are paying the list price are the people who can afford it the least.""Aprigliano said she's heard time and again of diabetics being forced to choose between a life-saving drug and paying other bills, like rent or buying food. Additionally, she said, one in four people on insulin has rationed their medication — purposely taking less than they need — in order to stretch the expensive drug over a longer period of time.""We shouldn't have to spend our days wondering whether we pay rent or pay for food or for my child's health,"" Aprigliano said.As the Democratic primary race begins to take shape, that message seems to have reached the ears of some 2020 contenders.Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) talked about the issue in her announcement speech last month, sharing the story of a 26-year-old man who, three days short of payday, was forced to ration his insulin and ultimately died due to lack of access to the medication.""This disgrace should never have happened in the United States of America. Not with a simple drug that's been around for nearly a century,"" Klobuchar said in Minneapolis. ""The obstacle to change? The big pharma companies think they own Washington. Well they don't own me.""Klobuchar said the Senate needs to pass legislation that would allow health care providers to import drugs from other countries. Additionally, she would stop Big Pharma's practice of ""paying off generic companies to keep their products off the market,"" and ""harness the negotiating power of 43 million seniors"" to lift the ban on negotiating cheaper drug prices under Medicare.The issue of rising insulin has caught the attention of two other 2020 contenders, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ), in the early days of their campaigns. Just days before announcing his presidential bid, Sanders was tweeting about insulin pricing.""Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all,"" he wrote. ""97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can't afford their medication. Outrageous.""Conservative estimates have found that, under Sanders' Medicare for All plan — a central plank of his White House bid — the government would save $61 billion on pharmaceuticals. The single payer advocacy group Physicians for a National Program has estimated that, given the government's strengthened negotiating power under a single-payer system, drug savings — especially for high cost pharmaceuticals like insulin — would be three times that. Another 2020 contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who co-sponsored Sanders' Medicare for All bill, has proposed yet another idea: Let the federal government begin to produce its own pharmaceuticals, including insulin, in order to counter the exorbitant costs of some drugs.Sampat, the Columbia University economist, thinks Warren's idea could work. He believes that the federal government would be immune from patent infringement. The argument some of his colleagues have made against government involvement in production, Sampat said, is that such a program would be inefficient. But, he said, ""We're dealing with an extremely inefficient system already. We could tolerate someone doing that with 80 percent of the acumen.""Both Stark and Aprigliano said they are excited that a health issue as specific as the rising cost of insulin has become a campaign issue. But Stark said that she's glad candidates are considering proposals to lower the cost of insulin and other drugs, talk isn't enough. She the presidential contenders to walk the talk, and swear off donations from pharmaceutical companies.Booker — who during his Senate campaign took more money from Big Pharma in 2014 than any other Democrat — did exactly that last year.""It arouses so much criticism and [we] just stopped taking it,"" Booker told NPR in June. In a statement following the interview, Booker's spokesman Jeff Giertz said the donations from Big Pharma ""became a distraction from his efforts to bring down prescription drug costs"" and that they would not resume.In the last election cycle, 2020 contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), joined Booker, Sanders, and Warren in taking $0 from pharmaceutical companies, according to Kaiser Health News. Those who did take pharmaceutical dollars last cycle ultimately took relatively modest donations: Klobuchar took $8,500, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who is also a presidential contender, took $9,500. (Like Booker, however, Gillibrand has a long history of accepting drug company donations, having accepted more than $200,000 since 2007.)Aprigliano said the next item on her wish list in the fight against ever-inflating drug prices is a candidate willing to take up rebate reform. Right now, pharmacy benefit managers and health plans don't have to disclose how many rebates they pass along or the total value of such price breaks. One way to bring down insulin prices, advocates say, would be to make sure that patients pay the price negotiated between manufacturer and middle man, rather than a mysteriously negotiated list price.Aprigliano said the challenges faced by people who rely on insulin and other medications illustrate the ways in which our broader health care system is broken, and she wants to hear the more candidates address these concerns on the campaign trail.""There's so many things that are complex,"" she said. ""This shouldn't be one of them.""",https://t.co/KUubVA5P2l,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/E1vksMPzHV,news
Walmart's $25 insulin can't fix the diabetes drug price crisis,"Health care executives faced the ire of lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday, amid a growing outcry from patients who've been forced to ration insulin because of soaring prices.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) told a panel of insulin manufacturers and drug industry intermediaries assembled for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on insulin prices. ""I just want you to know your days are numbered.""While the executives fumbled to explain themselves over the course of two days of questioning, one ""solution"" to the insulin access crisis resurfaced on social media: Patients should just buy cheap insulin at Walmart.For context, the cost of the four most popular insulins has tripled over the past decade, forcing many of the millions of Americans with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who rely on the drug to skimp on or skip doses. Walmart indeed offers a relatively inexpensive choice, essentially over the counter. People can go to pharmacies in stores nationwide and, without a prescription, purchase a vial of Novo Nordisk's Novolin ReliOn Insulin for less than $25. (People with diabetes can require between one and six vials of insulin per month.)But there's a problem here: This low-cost option is far from ideal for all patients. Ultimately, ""Walmart-ism,"" as diabetes advocates call it, reveals a lot about what the debate around the insulin drug pricing crisis has become: a big blame game, filled with distractions from what's really driving up drug prices. The problems with Walmart's insulinDoctors and diabetes advocates point out that while ReliOn may help patients in a pinch, especially those without health insurance, it's also a formulation (known as ""human"" insulin) that came on the market in the 1980s, more than a decade before more refined insulins started to emerge. The newer insulins, known as analogs, appear to be more effective at preventing dangerous blood sugar swings in people with Type 1 diabetes or those at a higher risk for severe low blood sugar. (The evidence of insulin analog's benefits is less clear for Type 2 diabetes, but the studies are also low quality so it's difficult to make conclusive statements.) There's one more problem: Because it's available without a prescription, patients can get the drug without the supervision of a doctor, and they sometimes get into trouble as a result. So stories have surfaced about patients who required emergency care because of severe blood sugar highs and lows after self-dosing with Walmart insulin, or even dying as a result. ""Human insulins are a reasonable option for many patients with Type 2 diabetes,"" said Yale endocrinologist Kasia Lipska, who often prescribes the drugs for patients who can't afford newer formulations. ""But the drug isn't optimal for everybody. And human insulin sold at Walmart is definitely not the solution to our insulin crisis.""For people with Type 1 diabetes, human insulins ""are harder to live on, lead to worse control, make it harder to hold down a job, impact quality of life,"" said James Elliott, a trustee at T1International, an independent patient advocacy group, ""and not everyone lives near a Walmart."" A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the low-cost formulation is also available at CVS and Express Scripps, though patients have to apply for a discount program first. ""We have taken numerous steps to help make insulin more affordable for people living with diabetes,"" the spokesperson said. ""Approximately 775,000 people in the US use our human insulin."" So while it's true that Walmart offers insulin at a competitive price reminiscent of the days before insulin costs tripled and that it can be helpful for some patients, it's not great for everybody with diabetes, and it can be dangerous for some. Walmart-ism is part of the insulin drug pricing blame gameThe Walmart solution first went viral in February, after it was featured on TV in Texas and then posted to Facebook. It continues to be bandied about on social media whenever people mention rising insulin prices. According to the meme, the problem isn't that insulin is too expensive. The problem is that patients are too picky to take advantage of an affordable insulin option. According to the pharmacy benefit managers testifying before Congress Tuesday, it's the insulin manufacturers' companies that are driving up the cost of the drug. At another congressional hearing Wednesday, pharmaceutical company executives blamed pharmacy benefit managers for helping inflate prices and boasted about their financial assistance programs as solutions to the access crisis. The blame game involves many fingers pointing in many directions, but make no mistake: What's driving up insulin costs is that drug companies have raised prices because they can. As I recently explained, the US is an outlier in insulin costs and spending. America represents only 15 percent of the global insulin market and generates almost half of the pharmaceutical industry's insulin revenue. Although insulin was discovered a century ago, manufacturers have made incremental changes to their formulations that have allowed them to extend the patents for these drugs. Even where patents have expired, the road to getting generic insulin on the market is so complicated and expensive that recent attempts have failed.So how did we get here? Unlike other countries, America gives drug companies free rein to set prices. The result is that the cost of the four most popular types of insulin has tripled over the past decade, and the out-of-pocket prescription costs patients now face have doubled. Let's break that down with some dollar figures. By 2016, the average list price of insulin rose to $450 per month. Patients can wind up paying out of pocket anything from $25 per month, if they have generous health insurance coverage or buy older insulin versions at Walmart, to more than $1,000 if they don't have insurance or have a high deductible plan, according to T1International. One quick fix to improve insulin access Lately there's been more attention on the insulin pricing problem. Members of Congress have been pressuring drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers to bring insulin costs under control. Last Wednesday, the insurance behemoth Cigna, and its pharmacy benefit arm Express Scripts, announced a new program that'll cap the 30-day cost of insulin at $25. That's a 40 percent reduction from the $41.50-per-month fee people with Express Scripts benefits were paying in 2018.This week, Sanofi announced it will offer its insulin products at $99 per month for uninsured patients. But like the Walmart option, these programs amount to Band-Aid solutions, said Elizabeth Pfiester, the founder and executive director of T1International. With Walmart, patients are ""having to revert to an older insulin that can damage you,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Sanofi and Cigna programs ""can be shut down or rescinded at any time. That's not any kind of assurance for patients."" ""Patients will not fall for these fake measures that do nothing to solve the crisis we are facing,"" she added.There's one way the insulin drug pricing problem could be fixed, however: lowering the price of insulin, said Yale's Lipska. ""Ultimately, it's the list price that's hurting patients. I keep going back to that: Just fix the list price."" Companies could decide that instead of launching one-off programs or doling out discounts, they'll forgo profits and lower list prices once and for all. Or lawmakers could decide to regulate drug pricing. ""We have a big problem here,"" Lipska said. ""People are hurting and people are dying. How much more will it take for them to regulate this? Clearly what's in place now is not working. This is a place where our legislators can step in and help protect the patients with diabetes.""

Best supplements for diabetes type 2: Prevent symptoms with turmeric in diet,"Diabetes is a common condition that affects more than four million people in the UK, and 90 per cent of cases are caused by type 2 diabetes. The condition is caused by the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the body not reacting to insulin. Without enough of the hormone, the body struggles to convert sugar in the blood into useable energy. But you could lower your risk of developing diabetes by regularly taking turmeric supplements, it's been claimed.Turmeric's active ingredient, curcumin, could help to reduce insulin resistance, and subsequently protect against diabetes, said registered nurse David Spero.It improves insulin function, which allows more insulin to get into cells, he claimed.Adding turmeric to your diet could also lower your cholesterol and even prevent some types of cancer, added the nurse.""One diabetes medicine may lower blood sugar and cholesterol, protect your eyes and kidneys, relieve pain, prevent cancer, and improve your sex life. It also tastes good,"" Spero wrote on Diabetes Self-Management.""This medicine is turmeric, made from the root Curcuma longa, a member of the ginger family.""Curcumin may also help treat aspects of diabetes, both type 1 and type 2.""Curcumin suppressed the activities of white blood cells called macrophages that cause inflammation.""This action of turmeric/curcumin could potentially slow down many complications of diabetes, in which inflammation plays a role.""You could also lower your chances of developing diabetes by taking American ginseng supplements, it's been claimed.The capsule could help the body's cells to respond to insulin, while also increasing the amount of insulin the body produces.But, it's crucial that you speak to a doctor before adding any new supplement to your diet.Many people may have diabetes without even knowing it, because the symptoms don't necessarily make you feel unwell.Common diabetes symptoms include persistent tiredness, having blurred vision, and passing more urine than normal.Speak to a doctor if you're worried about the warning signs of diabetes, or if you think you may be at risk.You could also lower your risk of high blood sugar by eating a healthy, balanced diet, and by doing regular exercise.There aren't any foods that patients should actively avoid, but it's important to limit the amount of sugar, fat and salt in your diet.",https://t.co/PnZ0i7tmuy,news

"Eli Lilly Will Sell Half-Price Version of Humalog, Its Popular Insulin","Outrage over the cost of insulin has driven much of the political conversation about high drug prices, with reports of patients dying because they could not afford it.In February, the Senate Finance Committee sent Lilly a letter asking for more information about how it sets prices for its insulin products, including Humalog. The letter noted that taxpayers spend more than $1 billion a year for Humalog through Medicare and Medicaid and said, ""When one insulin product costs the taxpayer more than $1 billion in one year, the American people ought to know how the company prices its product.""Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement Monday that the investigation into Lilly's insulin prices would continue. ""The company's decision to offer a generic version of a several decade old drug will be part of the investigation,"" he said.The story of insulin, many say, is a salient example of how the drug pricing system is broken. Over the years, industry intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers have negotiated ever-deeper discounts for insulin, yielding savings for the insurers and employers that pay the bulk of drug costs. Insulin manufacturers have responded by raising their list prices in an effort, they say, to please the benefit managers, who keep a percentage of the discounts they pass along.The list price of insulin has gone from about $20 per vial in 1996, when Humalog entered the market, to about $275 per vial today. Humalog patients typically use about two vials a month, Lilly said.The result is a yawning gap between the list price of insulin — which people who are uninsured must pay — and the net price that insurers and employers pay.Enrique A. Conterno, the president of Lilly's diabetes division, said Friday that the list price of the authorized generic will be comparable to the net price the company regularly offered to insurers in exchange for standard placement on their formulary, or the list of covered drugs, although he did not specify a dollar amount. But he said the company provided deeper discounts to insurers that give Humalog preferred treatment, which typically means lower out-of-pocket costs for patients.",https://t.co/NF7QFJEDF8,news

The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/ykXmoMFhsC,news
"Visibly irate lawmakers blast pharma, PBMs over insulin prices","WASHINGTON — Drug makers and their middlemen counterparts spent the first three months of the 116th Congress successfully dodging hard blows from members of Congress over the high cost of prescription drugs. That all changed Wednesday.Insulin makers and drug industry middlemen faced hours of hard questions Wednesday from an irate panel of lawmakers, many of whom appeared far more interested in threatening to blow up the entire drug pricing system than in hearing from the pharma company or pharmacy benefit manager executives who testified.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) told the assembled panel. ""You're in trouble … if you think you can just out talk us without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered.""advertisementWednesday's hearing, held by the oversight arm of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, began with an admonition from the committee's chair, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), that witnesses — which included Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, Cigna's Express Scripts, United Healthcare's Optum, and CVS — should focus on finding solutions, and not finger pointing. Within minutes, that pretense went out the window.The drama began with a seemingly benign, albeit contentious, question: Why do list prices keep increasing? The insulin makers pointed at the PBMs, the PBMs pointed at the drug makers. And those answers, it seemed, were the breaking point.For the next three hours, Democratic lawmakers in particular hammered drug makers and PBMs with questions, accusations, and screeds. Republicans volleyed their own, slightly tempered attacks. No one rose to defend either industry.And the threats from powerful lawmakers about reworking the entire system rang out the loudest of all.Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) told the panel that his constituents want Congress to begin setting list prices.""I'm reluctant to do that because I believe in a market-based system, but this is what I hear,"" Pallone added.PBMs, too, were not immune from the threats.""Just to get the lobbyists in the room to shudder a little bit, I think the PBMs should be utilities, or converted to nonprofits, or something,"" Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) said.Each of the executives came armed with data point after data point to make the case that they are working to ensure insulin is affordable — highlighting everything from patient assistance and charity programs to data showing net prices for insulins keep dropping. But lawmakers were unconvinced.When Eli Lilly Senior Vice President Mike Mason tried to point to the fact that his company had launched a half-priced authorized generic version of its insulin Humalog, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) retorted: ""So it took 15 years and global outcry on this to do it?""Sanofi's announcement, made just hours before the hearing, that it would cap insulin prices for patients, was similarly met with contempt.Time after time, irate lawmakers cut off the executives, visibly exasperated.Exactly what legislation the committee might pursue, however, is less clear. Neither lawmakers nor the witnesses testifying brought up clear solutions. And even DeGette acknowledged some of the bolder ideas — like having Congress directly set drug prices — were more rhetorical than actionable.""You should look at some of those statements as real expressions of frustration,"" she told STAT, when asked how seriously industry should take some of lawmakers' more sweeping threats.DeGette and Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), in their roles as chairs of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus, put out a slew of bipartisan legislative ideas late last year, which could serve as a blueprint for legislation to pursue this Congress.The ideas, which include requiring insulin makers to disclose how they set their list price and linking what patients pay out of pocket to negotiated drug prices rather than sticker prices, however, are a far cry from government price setting, or regulating PBMs out of business.DeGette, who hopes to have concrete progress on insulin affordability ""in July or in September,"" told reporters she remains ""100 percent"" sure any solution on insulin affordability will have bipartisan support.And while Republicans seemed less intent on Wednesday to throw knockout punches at drug makers, or their PBM counterparts, they too appeared intent on doing something on the issue.""I want to congratulate all of you because you have done something here today that we have been trying to do in Congress,"" said Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) ""And that is to create bipartisanship.""""This,"" he added, ""is going to end.""Washington correspondentNicholas Florko is a Washington correspondent for STAT, reporting on the the intersection of politics and health policy.",https://t.co/TPuNCXJAJW,news
Implantable 'Tea Bag' in Development Releases Insulin for Children with Diabetes,"Children with Type 1 diabetes have only one option to control their blood sugar: insulin treatment. Ravaged by an autoimmune disease that attacks their own pancreas and islets — microscopic clusters of cells that sense blood sugar and produce insulin — patients are forced to rely on insulin from an external source.But for the 200,000 youth living with Type 1 diabetes in the United States, insulin shots, pens and pumps fail to perfectly manage blood sugar, which may lead to long-term complications. When the body fails to tightly regulate sugar levels, like in diabetes, much can go wrong.""The absence of this natural ability — minute-to-minute regulation of glucose levels — can result in long-term complications, such as blindness, amputation and kidney failure,"" says Klearchos Papas, PhD, a professor in the Departments of Surgery and Medical Imaging at the University of Arizona College of Medicine – Tucson. ""Even with automated insulin delivery devices and continuous glucose monitoring — the best way possible to control your blood sugar — you still can end up with these consequences.""Dr. Papas adds, ""Interestingly, if you administer insulin aggressively to help lower and keep your blood sugar in the normal range, you actually increase your risk of potentially deadly hypoglycemic, or low blood sugar, episodes.""For the last two decades, Dr. Papas has been working on a solution to this problem. In collaboration with other scientists across the nation, the UA researcher has been developing a tiny, implantable device that senses glucose levels and releases insulin when needed.Now, with a two-year, $1.2 million grant from the JDRF, Dr. Papas will continue to perfect and test his device in preparation for clinical trials in humans. The project, which also includes a contribution of stem cell-derived islets from Novo Nordisk, is in collaboration with Tom Loudovaris, PhD, of St. Vincent's Institute, and Greg Korbutt, PhD, of the University of Alberta.The device operates using a medical innovation known as islet transplantation. In adults with Type 1 diabetes, islets are taken from donor bodies and dripped into the patient's liver, similar to an intravenous, or IV drip.Eventually, these islets begin producing insulin for the body, but in order for the patient's body to accept the transplanted cells, the patient must take lifelong immunosuppressive drugs.Because of this need for immunosuppressive drugs, islet transplantation is not recommended in children.""The need for lifelong immunosuppression is a major concern,"" says Dr. Papas, who leads the UA Institute for Cellular Transplantation. ""Children would be more susceptible to infections and lifelong treatment could cause other serious health conditions.""To avoid immunosuppressive medications in children and adults, Dr. Papas' device can protect transplanted insulin-producing islets from the body's attack. Donor islets are placed inside of the implantable, tea bag-like device, which has a special exterior that shields the islets from any attacks from the immune system.""It's like a tea bag,"" Dr. Papas says. ""The tea leaves stay inside but tea, or insulin, comes out. And the tea bag keeps out the immune cells that would normally attack the islets.""Such tea bag technology has been explored for decades but has not yet made it to patients for routine clinical use. One of the key issues that has limited the technology's success is the large size of the tea bag — at one point analogous to a large flat-screen TV.The professor also has developed a technology to feed oxygen to the islet cells in the tea bag for optimal health and insulin production.""The unique thing we bring to the table is the combination of an optimized tea bag with its own oxygen supply,"" Dr. Papas says. ""Islets are happier with an oxygen supply; they survive and function better and this has been overlooked in the past.""Under current plans, the oxygen generator — the size of a stack of quarters — eventually will be implanted alongside the islet tea bag. Implant locations include under the skin of the arm or back. The oxygen generator, which will use battery power, could be recharged without wires or removal from the body using a technology known as transcutaneous energy transfer.If testing is successful with the two-year JDRF grant, Dr. Papas could launch clinical trials with the device in the next three to four years.""This is not pie-in-the-sky crazy science,"" he says. ""We believe, engineering-wise, it is achievable. The cells and the biology were the difficult part and they have come a long way in the past five years.""Dr. Papas has been working closely with Tech Launch Arizona, the UA commercialization arm, to protect the intellectual property and strategize pathways to bring the technology to the world. As part of the two-year study, Novo Nordisk has donated human stem cell-derived islets to test in the tea bags. If successful, stem cell-derived islets would make it easier to help treat the millions of people with diabetes.UA President Robert C. Robbins, MD, said he is eager to see Dr. Papas and his team continue to develop this promising technology and take the device to market.Leigh Neumayer, MD, chair of the Department of Surgery agrees. ""The Department of Surgery is committed to research that helps identify gaps in patient care and allows us to offer our patients innovative, best-in-class solutions,"" she says. ""Dr. Papas' work exemplifies our research mission, and we eagerly anticipate continued advancements in the area of islet transplantation and juvenile diabetes.""""This is an incredible example of the kind of innovative and collaborative research that is taking place on the UA campus that has only recently become possible with the convergence of the physical, biological and digital worlds,"" Dr. Robbins said. ""The work that Dr. Papas and his team are doing to help children with diabetes is a great example of using new technology to significantly improve quality of life for patients, and why the UA is primed to be a leader in developing digital health.""Dr. Papas also is a member of the UA BIO5 Institute and the founder of Procyon Technologies LLC.Other project collaborators include: Berhnard Hering, MD, of the University of Minnesota; and UA College of Medicine – Tucson researchers Robert Johnson, PhD, Steve Neuenfeldt, Leah Steyn, PhD, Ron Lynch, PhD, and Robert Harland, MD.About the UA College of Medicine – TucsonThe University of Arizona College of Medicine – Tucson is shaping the future of medicine through state-of-the-art medical education programs, groundbreaking research and advancements in patient care in Arizona and beyond.

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/VYiiBpEr3t,news
"Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software Defined Radios","Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software DefinedÂ RadiosReverse Engineering an Insulin Pump for DIY Closed Loop TherapyRoughly 3 years ago, I heard about a website offering a bounty for something that was very close to my heart: reverse engineering communications to an insulin pump. My daughter was already using a system that I had helped to create called Loop, with a Medtronic pump that I had reverse engineered the RF comms forÂ¹. But the Medtronic pump required her to disconnect during her gymnastics for hours at a time. The tubeless design of this Omnipod pump sounded great, and I had all the tools to start working on the problem.The Omnipod system consists of a small disposable pump called a pod, and a controlling unit called a PDM.Because the PDM communicates with the pod using radio and the pod has no built in interface, it means the pod is entirely controllable over the radio. There was the potential to create a full integration with Loop using just a RileyLink, or a modified version of it.James Wedding had put up the bounty, and it attracted a lot of attention, and ultimately the right people who would be needed to make progress.Software DefinedÂ RadioSDRs are awesome tools; they make the hidden world of radio visible. There are all kinds of messages zipping by all the time, and these tools let you poke around, see the messages, and with some work, start decoding the little blips you see there. If you're looking for messages from a specific device, you need to know what general area to start looking in. That's where the FCC public filings come in handy.The FCC filing for the PDM, RBV-019, shows that the device transmits in the 433MHz range. Configuring the SDR software to listen in the 433MHz range while issuing a status from the PDM shows comms like this:As I eventually learned, those two bright lines are indicative of a certain type of modulation called frequency shift keying, or FSK. This means that the frequency of the signal varies with the information being transmitted. A 1 bit is sent as a higher frequency (the top line) and a 0 bit is sent with a slightly lower frequency (the bottom line). And using the tool inspectrum we can have it analyze the data to more clearly show the 1's and 0's. Here's a very zoomed in view of that first message above:I ended up writing a python script to extract these bits so we could look at them as a whole packet.It turns out this repeating pattern was part of the preamble. To conserve energy, receivers often have a pattern of sleeping, and waking up periodically to check for a signal. The transmitter sends a preamble long enough to catch the receiver during one of the short listening periods. When the receiver hears the preamble, it stays awake until the real data shows up.There was one more layer we had to get through before we were looking at actual packet data. You can't send your data over the radio exactly as the original bits, because the receiver uses the transitions to synchronize in time when to expect the next bit. If you have a long set of 1's or 0's, the receiver could get out of sync. So radio communications usually use an encoding to make sure there are enough transitions. The Omnipod communications use an encoding called Manchester encoding. Each bit is encoded by two bits. A 1 bit is encoded as 10, and a 0 bit is encoded as 01.This all took a lot of hashing out and there were a lot of theories shared in the openomni slack, as we tried to make getting the raw bits repeatable. Mark Brighton, Dan Caron, and @larsonlr, had been having some success with using RFCat and a TI Stick to capture packets. Evariste Courjaud would eventually write a tool called rtlomni used an rtl-sdr stick to listen for packets and decode them that would prove to be very convenient and more reliable than the TI-Stick based methods.Decoding PacketsOnce we had the actual bits of the packet, we started to look into packet structure. Based on what bits were changing between different pods, and different commands, we pieced together an understanding that looked like this.CRC8Radio is a far from perfect transmission medium. There are many different sources of interference that can make the receiver hear a 1 when a 0 was sent, and vice versa. It's important to know when this has happened, so most protocols use a checksum of sorts, often something called a CRC. The receiver computes the CRC as it receives the data, and the last byte of the packet includes the CRC as the transmitter computed it. If they don't match, the receiver throws the packet away and waits for a retransmission.The Omnipod protocol used a standard 8-bit CRC, so when we found this, we thought we were really close to having the messages figured out. Little did we know…Messages, CRC16Some messages are too big to fit into a single packet, so they are sent as multiple packets. We started to piece together the format of messages, and noticed another set of bits at the end of each message that looked like a 16-bit crc. But it was weird; 5 of the 16 bits were never set. We tried many different techniques to figure out how this was being set, but nothing worked.This was the first big blocker; we could proceed to work out what the other bits in the messages were, but it would be little help to understand what was being sent, but not be able to generate new packets ourselves, and so progress slowed down.Months passed with little progress, and finally in winter of 2016 a member of the group with the handle @lorelai posted that she had sucessfully dumped the firmware from the larger ARM-based chip on the PDM, and started the tedious process of disassembly: taking cpu instructions and turning them into human understandable code with semantic variable and function names. She did an amazing job figuring out what various methods were involved in sending data over the radio.I was looking at one of the unnamed routines, and noticed it looked like a standard implementation of a table based CRC calculation. And the table had the values for a standard 16 bit CRC. I wrote my own implementation using the table, and it checked out like a normal CRC. Then I looked closely at how the function was written. A normal CRC implementation looks like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &lt;&lt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Theirs looked like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Spot the difference? What should've been a bitwise left shift operator had somehow been coded as a right shift. This is a bug; there is no reason to cripple your own CRC algorithm, as it makes it less likely to catch corrupted messages.We were up and running again! We started working on decoding messages, recording sessions from the PDM for delivering boluses, temp basals, suspends, etc…NonceAll of the insulin delivery commands had a 4-byte chunk of data near the beginning of the message that looked like it might be some form of cryptography. Again, we tried many different ways of interpreting it, and analyzing it in the context of the messages it was sent in, but it wasn't a crc (we'd see the same 4 bytes on occasion even when the message data was different). And sometimes we'd see the pattern repeat. It looked maybe this was a bit of the protocol designed to prevent replay of data. Other protocols had features like this, called a nonce.One possible route we had considered was to record a database of messages to replay for given commands. Even if the address of each pod was different, now that we knew how to generate the message crc, we could take a copy of the command we had seen before, put a new address on the message, and recompute the crc. Except this nonce was preventing us from using that strategy. For the next insulin delivery command, no matter what command was sent, the pod would only accept the next nonce in the sequence, and we didn't know how to generate the next nonce.But hey! We have the decompiled PDM firmware now, we can just look there! So we pored over the PDM firmware, and tracked down the message generation in the code, and found where those four bytes should be. But instead of a method computing some cryptographic Nonce, we just found the four characters ""INS.. WTF?!?! Ok, somehow this area of the message must be being updated later in the pipeline.There was another chip on the PDM, closer to the radio. It was the same chip that was used in the Pods, a chip with an identifier of SC9S08ER48, something that wasn't documented online, and was likely produced custom for Insulet. Maybe we could get the firmware off of that chip. Unfortunately, that chip was locked, which prevented dumping of firmware.Again, progress slowed… This felt like a real dead end. We had thrown all our smarts at this nonce, and didn't have any good leads on the math that was behind it. And the ER48 that (possibly) held the secrets was locked and it was hard to find any public details that might help us crack it.X-Ray imagesIn trying to understand more about the ER48, some members of the slack community offered to try to get Xray images, which was really cool, but unfortunately didn't open up any new avenues.Overview XrayDetail XrayDecapping andÂ ImagingDan Caron decided to reach out to a researcher, Dr. Sergei Skorobogatov, at the University of Cambridge in the UK that he had read about who had experience in extracting code from locked chips, and convinced him to take a look at our problem. Dr. Skorobogatov had led research in using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) for chip reverse engineering and suggested it might be possible, but would be expensive, needing access to expensive equipment, and not guaranteed. Joe Moran, who had recently started using Loop after we met at the Fall 2016 Nightscout Hackathon dove in to helping out with this project, and arranged with a bay area company, Nanolab Technologies, to perform the decapping and imaging of the chips, and also graciously funded Nanolab and Dr Skorobogatov's work (and also his personal boxes of pods).Dr. Skorobogatov had Nanolab perform a variety of imaging techniques to ascertain if the protection could be defeated with known non-invasive or semi-invasive methods. This resulted in a lot of images, some of them very beautiful. These are optical microscope pictures of the silicon die.Optical microscope dieÂ overviewOptical microscope dieÂ overviewThere were also images taken of specific areas of the die using scanning electron microscopy. Attempts were made with different voltages, different surface preparations, and different equipment.SEM Image of flash memory cells. Not resolving data.Unfortunately, none of these produced images capable of resolving the actual contents of the flash.Dr. Skorobogatov had one last resort method that was only to be used if these other techniques failed. It was a proprietary method that would have to be given the blessing to be used by the University. Dr. Skorobogatov did an initial test and confirmed that it was capable of resolving the data on this chip. But before we could proceed an NDA had to be agreed upon and so negotiations about who was to be the recipient of the extracted firmware were undertaken.The Nightscout foundation would ultimately be the party signing the NDA and would take the responsibility to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the methods and results of the extraction.The result of this arrangement and work was an incredible paper written by Dr Sergei Skorobogatov, and the raw firmware data. The initial extraction of the firmware had a significant number of errors, but was enough to get started on. Joe asked at the spring Nightscout Foundation Hack if anyone would be up for digging into the disassembly. Nobody raised their hands. Turning the cpu instructions into something understandable is painstaking work, and there are very few people who know how to do it. I tried digging into it, using cpu instruction documentation, but made very little progress, and grew frustrated. Others optimistically asked for request to the firmware with big expectations of fast progress, and then realized the scope and challenge of the task and quietly dropped off.Example disassembly of SC908 instructionsIt turns out Joe also has an extensive background working at the assembly level, and started taking on the onerous task himself. In July, Dr. Skorobogatov had completed a second extraction with much fewer errors. Over the summer Joe Moran worked tirelessly on mapping out the huge amount of cpu instructions, and slowly fitting them together into a larger picture of pod pseudocode.Eventually, Ken Shirriff, an expert in hardware reverse engineering, would join the effort and sped up the process considerably. Together, Joe and Ken eventually mapped out enough code to find the function responsible for coding the nonce September of 2017.RileyLink andÂ LoopWe had been updating the openomni python scripts with our understanding of the comms, but now it was time to start focusing on RileyLink + iOS, so I started work on OmniKit, and firmware updates for the RileyLink. I believed we had the fundamentals of the protocol worked out, and the rest was just details. Again, completely underestimating how much more was ahead of us.I had to write new firmware that would handle the pod modulation and encoding. I also had to rewrite the way the two chips on the RL talked to each other to handle 0's, as 0 was a special end of packet marker for Medtronic. Much in Loop needed to be reworked to support multiple Pumps, and new interfaces made to support pairing, deactivating, and handling faults. Thankfully Nate Racklyeft had set a solid foundation in Loop for this to happen.Meanwhile, work on understanding the format of the commands continued and was documented thoroughly on the openomni wiki, which is the most comprehensive documentation on the pod protocol published publicly. Joe, Evariste, and Eelke Jager really did a massive amount of work decoding messages, and updating the pages over time. Various members of the slack channel have contributed captures of PDM to Pod communications to aid decoding efforts.The decoding was fun work, with lots of small wins as each component of each command is deciphered, and I really enjoyed working on this part, and adding code to Loop to implement. In April of 2018 I shared on slack that I had ""paired via iPhone + RL, primed, cannula insertion, basal schedule programmed, and then bolused 5U.The 2.0 RL firmware was finished in July of 2018, and new shipments started including it. It was hoped that these boards would be able to be used with Loop and Omnipod, but the existing 915 MHz antenna would prove to be too poor to do 433 MHz comms effectively.Decoding and implementation was progressed well over the summer, and the Loop experience was coming together. Joe did an amazing thing in providing funding for me to quit my day job, and focus more on this project, and to eventually join the wonderful Tidepool team. There were of course more events happening outside of the omnipod RE story in the DIY and regulator spaces that I won't cover, but it was a very interesting summer!ScreamersAs more functionality came online in the driver, I started hooking it up into Loop, including the ability to automatically adjust delivery by temp basals. At this point it was fairly common to get a screaming pod, which meant some of the pod's internal checking had detected a situation where it decided there was a problem and it should not continue to deliver insulin.But it seemed like a workable problem, as we continued to find small discrepancies in what Loop was sending versus what the PDM would send if the command was delivered manually, and I assumed if we fixed all of those that the screaming would stop.Looping!On October 3, 2018, Joe put a Loop controlled pod on himself and became the first Loop Omnipod user, but didn't tell me immediately as he knew I'd be worrying. When he did tell me, I still worried. We had seen the pod work, and understood the functionality, and the basic algorithm of Loop had been vetted for a long time, but still…A month later, at the November 2018 Nightscout Hackathon, a few more adventurous souls opted try it out for themselves as well, and became part of a small private testing group that would grow to over 30 people before the branch was made public.Unfortunately, we still had screamers often happening before the full 3 days of use were finished, and we had meticulously compared Loop's commands to PDM reference versions. Eelke was particularly helpful with this process, creating a script that could check commands against their reference versions automatically. I started to get worried that the increased demands on the battery for doing communication every five minutes had pushed the pod over the edge of what was sustainable.Pod voltage taps, drilled through back plastic, super-glued inÂ place.So I started measuring pod voltage with an arduino, recording the data and storing it a local database for visualization. Comparing PDM and Loop.Long time scale view of podÂ voltage.Unfortunately, this proved to be a dead end as well; using a PDM and bolusing large amounts, I could drive the pod to lower voltages than even Loop would do over the life of a looping pod, and wasn't able to make the pod scream. It seemed like voltage wasn't the issue, so there must be something else.RileyLinks with 955 MHz (left) and coil 433 MHz (right)Â antennasAt one point I noticed that if a message exchange with the pod failed, the pod would sometimes be left in a state of trying to complete the exchange by re-sending packets over and over and over. Testers logs were also showing lots of failures, and so I started experimenting with antennas. Both of these problems should be improved with better comms. I had planned on trying different antennas and had ordered from random places on the internet, but hadn't had time to try them until it became a priority.I had some flexible 433 MHz antennas that could be taped on the inside of the RL case. These would often have great performance in some scenarios, but not in others; it was too unreliable. When I got to the coil based one, it had good performance very consistently, and at very surprising ranges. Time for a new RileyLink case.With the new antenna, and some optimizations to do fewer message exchanges while still allowing adjustments every 5 minutes, the frequency of screamers went down to a very low rate. Likely comparable to using a pod normally with a PDM. In the most recent 7,500 hours of live testing, 94% of pods completed without faults.Testing and DocumentationThe testing group grew slowly, which was a great way to continually get new eyes on the system and see what parts were confusing. These testers put up with a lot of screaming pods, and contributed in very big ways to making Loop with Omnipod work better. They did this primarily by sharing issue reports from each of their pods, whether successful or not.The issue reports have a message log in them that could be analyzed by the tool that Eelke built, giving us insight into whether we had any misformatted commands and also let us gather statistics around certain parts of Loop's interaction with the pods.Marion Barker joined the testing group and added dedicated reporting, and additional statistics to the progress of testing, and we were able to use her stats of successful pods vs failures to have a high level view of progress.Eventually Katie DiSimone joined the testing group, and started a large restructuring of loopdocs.org to provide documentation for using Loop with multiple devices. The anticipation around a version of Loop that worked with Omnipod was incredibly high, and without good documentation, it was certain that we'd be flooded with the same questions over and over.New Features ForÂ LoopOmnipod integration required rethinking of some interface elements, and adding new controls. The pod doesn't report battery, and there is little a user can do about a low battery if one were to somehow happen, so displaying a battery level widget didn't make sense. Also, without a UI on the pump, the user needs to be able to cancel a bolus quickly. The reservoir icon was a picture of a Medtronic reservoir, so we wanted to rethink that. Thank you to Paul Forgione for designing the pod logo that now shows reservoir level.ThanksThank you to all the people who help make this long road come to a place where we can share this with others, and realize the goal that we set out to do a long time ago. I know I didn't cover everyone, and everything that happened. That would be impossible in a single post, and for me, since I only have my experience through this. It's hard to imagine the total hours put into this. If you could add them all up, I'm sure it would be shocking. Not to mention the work that has gone into making the Omnipod itself, which I imagine dwarfs this effort. So thank you *all*. Also, many of those hours would otherwise have been spent with families. I really appreciate my wife and kids being understanding with the time I've spent on this, and want to thank them too.SidenotesI have to mention Joakim Ornstedt, as one of the contributors to openomni decoding, and also the creator of what is probably actually the first looping integration with omnipod. He built a device that used optical character recognition (OCR) on the PDM to get data from the PDM, and wired in digital button presses to the PDM through another microcontroller. It's a hard to scale approach, but very clever, and bypasses a lot of the issues we had to deal with for an RE based solution. I really admired him for pulling this off, and getting looping in a tiny fraction of the time it took to make it work with Loop.",https://t.co/o2xk8vg0zL,news
Huddersfield woman's genius trick to avoid bears attacking her for insulin as she plans USA hike,"Later this month Helen Shepherd, from Huddersfield will be hiking the length of America to raise awareness of diabetes. Catherine Scott reports. Hiking the length of the US is a daunting challenge for anyone, but when you have type 1 diabetes that challenge becomes even greater.But that's exactly what a 49-year-old pensions specialist from Huddersfield is planning to do later this month. Helen Shepherd will set off for the Pacific Crest Trail, 25 years after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.The 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail runs the length of the United States, through three states − California, Oregon and Washington.""The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) has published figures which show that in 2016 around 22 per cent of people who applied to walk the entire trail actually completed the task. In 2017, due to numerous wildfires and record levels of snow leading to dangerous river crossings, many decided to cut their attempt short for safety's sake,"" says Helen.""A few years ago, I decided I wanted to do something big, something that would really push me out of my comfort zone and to show that having diabetes doesn't have to stop you doing anything in life. I read a book by a painter and decorator who had done the Pacific trail and it sounded just like the challenge I wanted. I love to wild camp and really push myself.""The Pacific Crest Trail runs straight through mountain lion and black bear habitat. While unprovoked attacks are rare, the bears will try to get at any food hikers carry with them.""I'll be wild camping on the route which means being aware of any potentially dangerous plants and wildlife. I'll have to store anything that smells in a bear-proof caddy, away from my tent. Insulin also smells, but I'll need that close by in case I need to use it during the night so I've found some odour-proof bags online that I can keep my insulin in to help minimise the smell,"" says Helen.""A black bear's sense of smell is seven times greater than a bloodhound's which demonstrates why these steps are necessary.""A trip like this needs a lot of planning, but having Type 1 diabetes means even more organisation. People with Type 1 diabetes cannot produce insulin, no one knows what causes it but it's got nothing to do with being overweight and it isn't currently preventable. It is treated by daily insulin doses. Helen will have to make sure she can access insulin during the trip so that she doesn't run out, as well as keeping the insulin at the right temperature using a Frio bag. ""It will require some serious monitoring of blood sugar levels, ensuring that hypos are recognised and treated swiftly, making sure I eat the right sort of food and crucially, that I can keep all my medication at the right temperature. ""I've made sure to take safety precautions. I'll be carrying a satellite communicator, so that my family can track where I am and also a special scanning machine which means I won't have to constantly test my blood sugar levels, but I have no idea how they will work at altitude or in the extreme cold.""The challenge has been years in planning, but Helen still didn't know whether it could definitely go ahead until she was granted a permit in late November last year. She has given herself just five-and-a-half months to cover the distance and she is being joined by a fellow type 1 diabetic – who she has never met before,""When I started to plan the trip I thought it would be good to have a team of around five people, but it is very difficult getting people who want to do the same thing at the same time and can get the time off work and so it looked like it was just going to be me."" But then Helen wrote an article for Frio and it was read by a woman in Australia who had been planning to do exactly the same trail as Helen just a year later.""She contacted me and she decided that she could pull her trip forward. As a fellow type 1 sufferer, we will be able to support each other.""As well as planning, Helen has been training for the past few years.""Another huge motivation was to get fitter and doing regular exercise has also made managing my blood glucose levels easier. I've taken on a number of smaller challenges like climbing Snowdon and at the end of August I did the 'Coast-to-Coast' walk from St Bees in Cumbria to Robin Hood's Bay in North Yorkshire, but nothing like the Pacific Trail.""Helen likens the forthcoming trip to walking from Land's End to John O'Groats not once but more than three times non-stop. ""On top of this, you are carrying everything you need such as a tent, food, water, clothing over terrain that ranges from sea level to heights of up to 4,009 metres. Just for good measure, we will also throw in temperatures of around 100F (38C) at the start, building up to freezing, snowbound mountains in the middle where the use of ice axes and crampons are strongly advised.""We are determined to reach our goal and in doing so, my main aim is to show people currently living with diabetes that adventures are possible and dreams can be achieved and also to raise money for Diabetes UK. ""It just takes good planning, the right equipment and a stubborn desire to ignore the naysayers and just do it.""Tyler Anderson, Diabetes UK Regional Fundraiser said: ""This is an incredible challenge and we are extremely grateful for all the support Helen has given to Diabetes UK and for all her efforts to raise awareness of the condition. Her hard work and dedication will go a long way to helping us create a world where diabetes can do no harm.""Helen will be chronicling her trip via her online blog: https://www.hikingtype.com/ and Instagram page:https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en To sponsor Helen for her epic trek visit: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/shepherd-pctFor more information visit www.diabetes.org.uk",https://t.co/5K4tqFlTLK,news
LOVE MEAT - Ketogenic Diet And Ketosis Inspiration,"Apparel Men's Premium T-Shirt Women's Premium T-Shirt Unisex T-Shirt Women's T-Shirt Lightweight Hoodie Long T-Shirt Hoodie (Pullover) Classic T-Shirt Graphic T-Shirt Women's Chiffon Top Contrast Tank Graphic T-Shirt Dress A-Line Dress Women's Fitted Scoop T-Shirt Women's Fitted V-Neck T-Shirt Women's Relaxed Fit T-Shirt Leggings Scarf Mini Skirt Kids Clothes Lightweight Sweatshirt Cases &amp; Skins Wall Art Poster Canvas Print Photographic Print Art Board Art Print Framed Print Metal Print Home Decor Throw Pillow Floor Pillow Mug Clock Acrylic Block Wall Tapestry Duvet Cover Travel Mug Bags Tote Bag Studio Pouch Drawstring Bag Stationery Sticker Greeting Card Spiral Notebook Hardcover Journal Artist's Description If you, or someone you know is interested in healthy lifestyle choices and the Ketogenic Diet – also called Keto, Low-Carb High-Fat Diet or LCHF – this LOVE MEAT design is for you! Keto can have numerous benefits. As a treatment, it's often used for epilepsy seizures, it can offset the metabolic syndrome, may improve or stops sleep apnea. It can have positive effects on wide variety of systems of the body. I.e. the brain, the gut, the joints and much more. The Ketogenic Diet differs from the Atkins or the Carnivore Diet because it allows a little bit more carbs – preferably in the form of complex carbohydrates.

The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/3mqI9BaIGO,news

The 5 Best Kept Secrets for Women's Health - by Cynthia Pasquella,"It's no secret that we women are constantly seeking balance in our lives while juggling careers, homes, and families. As challenging as this is, it can be an even greater battle to keep our hormones, diets, and stress levels in balance.The negative effects of being out of balance can cause a variety of issues that are harmful to women's health and happiness.That's why I'm sharing these best-kept secrets. I want to help you prevent imbalances so you can enjoy a slimmer body, day-long energy, and unbridled happiness naturally! #1: Hemp (omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids)Rich in essential fatty acids, hemp is an excellent source of omega-3 and omega-6. These fatty acids can help prevent the risk of endometriosis, which is the presence of uterine tissue outside of the uterus that occurs in menstruating women of reproductive age.A long-term study of more than 70,000 American nurses found that women who consumed the most omega-3 fatty acids were 22 percent less likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis than those who ate the least. Find a way to enjoy this amazing plant daily. I recommend hemp protein powder in your morning smoothie! #2: CurcuminThe powerful anti-inflammatory spice curcumin, a major component of turmeric, can be particularly helpful in combatting pain due to fibroids.Fibroids are benign tumors that grow in the smooth muscle cells of the uterus. The symptom of pain associated with fibroids is often due to widespread inflammation in the uterus.In 2011, Japanese researchers found that, when taken daily, 2000mg of curcumin can provide potent anti-inflammatory benefits. Sneak this spice into a nice curry dish and enjoy! #3: Vitex agnus-castus (chasteberry)Sometimes called ""the women's herb,"" Vitex agnus-castus, or chasteberry, this amazing berry has traditionally been used for fertility issues.It regulates the pituitary gland, which in turn sends chemical signals to the ovaries promoting ovulation. Pretty powerful stuff for such a little guy!A study that examined the fertility effects of a vitex herbal extract involved 93 women who had tried unsuccessfully to conceive for up to 36 months. Fifty-three women were given 20 to 40mg per day of the vitex extract and 40 were given a placebo.After three months, 26 percent of the women given vitex became pregnant compared to 10 percent of the placebo group. A daily supplement is a perfect way to incorporate this into your diet. #4: Black Cohosh ExtractA great way to aid hormone imbalances associated with menopause is to bring on the black cohosh extract!This amazing ingredient can provide effective relief for women who are experiencing hot flashes.In a randomized, double blind study, 304 postmenopausal women were either given 8mg per day of black cohosh extract or a placebo. Researchers found that women given black cohosh extract experienced significant relief of hot flashes.Pick up a high quality supplement today! #5: Myo-inositolA natural supplement called myo-inositol can be an effective treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which is one of the most common hormonal disorders in women.In 2007, researchers in Italy studied the effects of myo-inositol on 25 women with irregular menses due to PCOS. The women were given the supplement daily for a timeframe of six months.Eighty-eight percent of the women who were treated had at least one menstrual cycle, and of these, 72 percent continued ovulating normally. Forty percent of the women also became pregnant.But wait, there's more. A 2011 Italian double-blinded study confirmed that myo-inositol decreases testosterone and increases insulin sensitivity, making it useful for the treatment of PCOS.I love to toss a bit of myo-inositol, in powdered form, into my morning smoothie.I know that sometimes our hectic lives can result in forgetting about caring for one of the most important things of all – yourself! Using these powerful and natural ingredients can help you to feel healthy, beautiful, and balanced in all areas of your life!Cynthia PasquellaCynthia Pasquella is known as The Transformational Nutritionist®.

Insulin Is A Major Focus In The Debate Over Rising Prescription Drug Prices,"Lawmakers in the House and Senate are pressing companies to lower prices for insulin which is essential for many people with diabetes. The price is 10 times higher today than it was 20 years ago. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The pressure to lower drug prices now focuses on insulin. Lawmakers in the House and Senate want companies to cut prices for insulin, which is essential for many people with diabetes. The price is 10 times higher today than it was a couple of decades ago. There is one company lowering costs, as we hear from NPR's Alison Kodjak. ALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Express Scripts manages prescription drug insurance for more than 80 million people. It says it's offering a plan so the diabetes patients it covers will pay only $25 a month for their medicine. Dr. Steve Miller is the chief clinical officer for the health insurance company Cigna, which owns Express Scripts. STEVE MILLER: What we're hoping is that we're going to see more diabetics taking their insulin, less complications for those patients and hopefully lower health care costs. KODJAK: He says the company, which covers 1.4 million people who take insulin, hopes the lower prices will mean patients will be more likely to take insulin according to their doctor's orders. Under the plan, even people who haven't met their deductible or who usually pay a percentage of the drug's retail price will not pay more than $25 a month. Express Scripts announced the new plan just a day after members of Congress held a hearing on the high cost of insulin. Gail DeVore, a patient advocate who has been dependent on insulin for 47 years, testified at the House hearing yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GAIL DEVORE: Every day I get emails from people asking, how do I afford insulin? Every day. And every day I have to help them find a way to find insulin. KODJAK: She says she has a good job and good insurance but still has forgone car repairs and doesn't take vacations because she spends so much on her own medication. A recent study by researchers at Yale found that about a quarter of people with diabetes skipped doses or use less than prescribed to save money. Kasia Lipska is a research professor at Yale's medical school. She told the lawmakers that drug companies are using insulin to boost profits, not come up with better drugs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KASIA LIPSKA: I'll just go back to this vial of insulin. This is the same stuff - right? - this is the same insulin that's been around since 1996. Nothing has changed except the price. KODJAK: Express Scripts says the $25 copay plan won't apply to patients who have government-sponsored insurance like Medicare or Medicaid. It'll be available to consumers whose insurance companies opt in, and it covers insulin made by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, two of the biggest insulin makers in the world. Alison Kodjak, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF WHEN THE CLOUDS' ""THE DAWN AND THE EMBRACE"") INSKEEP: We should note both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been NPR financial supporters in the past. Insulin made by the pharmaceutical company Sanofi will also be covered under this plan. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Republicans Jim Jordan And Mark Meadows Warn Drug Companies Not To Cooperate With Congressional Investigation,"WASHINGTON â€"" In an unusual move, House Republicans are warning drug companies against complying with a House investigation into drug prices.Republicans on the House Oversight Committee sent letters to a dozen CEOs of major drug companies warning that information they provide to the committee could be leaked to the public by Democratic chair Elijah Cummings in an effort to tank their stock prices.Cummings requested information from 12 drug companies such as Pfizer Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Novartis AG in January as part of a broad investigation into how the industry sets prescription drug prices.In their letters, Reps. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows â€"" leaders of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus â€"" imply that Cummings may be attempting to collect the information in order to bring down the industry's stock prices.They write that Cummings is seeking sensitive information ""that would likely harm the competitiveness of your company if disclosed publicly. They then accuse Cummings of ""releasing cherry-picked excerpts from a highly sensitive closed-door interview conducted in an investigation into White House security clearances. ""This is not the first time he has released sensitive information unilaterally, says the letter. The authors say they ""feel obliged to alert the drug companies of Cummings' actions.Democrats expressed bafflement at the letters. While politicians routinely spar over committee work, warning companies not to comply with an investigation is unconventional â€"" perhaps even unprecedented, Democrats say.""Rep. Jordan is on the absolute wrong side here, Cummings said in an emailed statement to BuzzFeed News. ""He would rather protect drug company 'stock prices' than the interests of the American people.In their letter, Jordan and Meadows say that ""while we cannot speculate about Chairman Cummings' motives, the committee should not pursue an investigation designed to impact stock prices.This hinges on a quote from Cummings saying he has three staffers he calls ""the drug team who work on the high cost of drugs and that their work has lowered drug company stocks.The quote omits the full context of Cummings' remarks. At the time he was appearing before the Committee on House Administration seeking an increase in funding for his committee. (Jordan, as the ranking Oversight Republican, objected to a funding increase.)The letter quotes Cummings as saying of his drug team: ""If you follow the headlines, we have already seen the impact they have had… on stock prices with regard to drugs. I mean, it has been astronomical. The letter omits the rest of the sentence: ""saving the taxpayers money.In the edited quote, Cummings seems to be bragging about an ""astronomical impact on drug company stocks. In the context of his statements before and after, he seems to be saying the ""astronomical impact is on taxpayer savings, which justify giving his committee more resources. A minute later he says: ""Whatever you all give us, we will give it back in savings by rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse.Jordan's office insisted that the letter does not tell companies not to respond to Cummings' requests, and in fact encourages the companies to cooperate with ""responsible and legitimate oversight. However, Jordan's office reiterated that he has grave concerns that in this case Democrats are out to destroy drug company stock value.",https://t.co/9N5lvndoB9,news
Diabetics struggle as drug prices soar,"Struggling to stay alive: Rising insulin prices cause diabetics to go to extremes The escalating cost of insulin has desperate diabetics rationing medication, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from Canada or Mexico. Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY Corrections &amp; Clarifications: This story has been updated to reflect royalty payments for a 1923 patent.Meaghan Carter died alone on the sofa of her suburban Dayton, Ohio, apartment last Christmas.Like most people with Type 1 diabetes, the 47-year-old nurse had a kit of essential supplies within reach. It contained two empty vials of her preferred insulin, a partial vial of inexpensive Walmart insulin and a half-filled container of testing strips to measure blood glucose levels.Uninsured, between jobs and with $50 in a bank account, Carter probably had attempted to stretch a limited supply of insulin until she got a final paycheck from her last job, family members say. She was scheduled to begin a new nursing job the following week that offered health insurance.""There was no insulin at all in the refrigerator,"" says Mindi Patterson, Carter's sister-in-law. ""She had gauze, bandages and all her nursing supplies. She had plenty to take care of others but not enough to take care of herself."" She buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive in the US Deidre Waxman buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive for her on MedicareErin Clark and Jasper Colt, USA TODAYThe cost of insulin for diabetics such as Carter has drawn national scrutiny as Congress examines factors contributing to the nation's escalating prescription drug prices. All people with Type 1 and some with Type 2 diabetes need the drug, but regular price hikes make insulin difficult to afford for the uninsured and those whose coverage requires significant cost sharing.Patient advocates are becoming increasingly vocal about the affordability of a drug invented nearly a century ago by scientists who took steps to make the medicine inexpensive. One group staged protests outside the offices of the nation's three dominant insulin makers.Canadian scientists discovered insulin in 1921, treated the first diabetic patient in 1922 and sold the patent to the University of Toronto for 3 Canadian dollars. The university administered the patent and received royalty payments from drug companies that sold human insulin.The price of modern versions of a drug that more than 7 million Americans need to live nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013, according to one study. Type 1 diabetics paid an average of $5,705 for insulin in 2016 – nearly double what they paid in 2012, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.Diedre Waxman lives in Newton, Mass., and has Type 1 diabetes. Diagnosed six years ago, Waxman has adopted a strict diet, so she doesn't need as much insulin, which she purchases from Canada.Erin Clark for USA TODAYPatient advocates say people have resorted to extreme measures such as taking less than the doctor prescribed to make it last longer, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from less expensive pharmacies in Canada or Mexico.More: Lack of insulin could affect 40 million people with diabetes by 2030, study findsLast month, the powerful Senate Finance Committee asked the three dominant insulin makers detailed questions about the drugs' price increases. The price for one vial of Eli Lilly's Humalog surged from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015. From 2013 to this year, Novo Nordisk's Novolog jumped from $289 to $540 and Sanofi's Lantus from $244 to $431, according to a committee letter.A vial of insulin loses potency after being opened for 28 days. The amount of insulin a patient needs varies depending on such factors as age, weight, diet and overall health.Among things senators want to know: How do drugmakers set insulin prices, and what's the role of rebates and discounts to middlemen pharmacy benefit managers?Senators are not limiting questions to Big Pharma. The nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, who drew scrutiny for their increasingly powerful role as middlemen in the drug supply chain, will appear before the committee April 3.Drugmakers say they've taken steps to address prices, offered co-pay cards to limit out-of-pocket expenses and funded patient-assistance programs that provide free medication to thousands of vulnerable Americans.Sanofi pledged to limit annual price increases to less than the average health spending rate.This month, Eli Lilly unveiled a half-price version of Humalog called insulin lispro for $137.50 for a single vial. It's the same drug as Humalog, only with a different label.In a statement, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the lower-cost insulin is a ""bridge that addresses gaps in the system until a more sustainable model is achieved.""Simeon Taylor, a University of Maryland School of Medicine diabetes researcher, says Type 1 diabetics without adequate insurance coverage are vulnerable to price increases because they can't live without the drug.""Insulin is not an optional medication,"" says Taylor, who formerly worked for Eli Lilly and the National Institutes of Health. ""People have to buy insulin no matter what the cost is. That gives a lot of strength to the people selling insulin.""'Whole system needs to be evaluated'Some suggest that a simple across-the-board price cut might not work for all patients under the system.The American Diabetes Association convened an Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group to study rising insulin prices and affordability of the life-sustaining medicine. The group's study concluded that a complex supply chain from the drug factory to the pharmacy might promote higher prices.Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers, demand rebates from drug manufacturers. Their leverage: placing the drug on an insurer's formulary – the list of drugs that the insurance company will cover for insured consumers.A drugmaker that offers a lower rebate might be excluded from a prescription drug plan or be placed on a less favorable tier that requires consumers to pay a larger portion on the tab.More: Insulin costs nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, report saysThe ADA's working group's report found that even though drugmakers' ""list prices"" for insulin have surged, their ""net prices"" have grown at a more modest rate. The list price is how much the drugmaker charges. The net price is money the drugmaker gets after fees, discounts and rebates to wholesalers or pharmacy benefit managers.Consumers are not privy to these behind-the-scenes negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers and drug manufacturers. All of this is done outside the public's view.""A lot of attention has focused on the manufacturers and less on the other players in the supply chain,"" says Karen Van Nuys, a research professor at USC's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and member of the ADA's working group. ""We think those players also share responsibility for what happens to prices and access.""Van Nuys says that if one drugmaker lowers insulin prices, that could put it at a competitive disadvantage compared with peers. That is because pharmacy benefit managers might still require a significant rebate.Novo Nordisk says its insulin net prices declined at double-digit rates in 2017 and 2018 because of rebate demands.""The whole system needs to be evaluated,"" Van Nuys says.Study: Cost affects insulin useNewton, Massachusetts, resident Deidre Waxman has good prescription-drug coverage through Medicare.But she worries that the $1,300 to $1,500 monthly retail cost of her insulin will be unaffordable if she reaches the doughnut hole, Medicare's deductible that kicks in once drug spending exceeds $3,820.She does not fill insulin prescriptions at her neighborhood pharmacy; she gets her medicine from Canada. Her husband buys insulin during his frequent work trips there, and she will take a six-hour car trip to Canada once a year to get insulin. A third source is Mark's Marine, a Vancouver, British Columbia, pharmacy that ships to U.S. patients.Waxman does not need much insulin because she is on a low-carbohydrate diet. If she has excess insulin, she packs it in styrofoam containers cooled with ice packs and sends it to fellow diabetes patients who can't afford the drug.""I send it to friends who are in dire need,"" Waxman says. ""These are people who would die without insulin.""Diedre Waxman's diabetes bag includes the pen she loads with cartridges to administer her insulin.Erin Clark for USA TODAYFor those without robust insurance coverage, there are signs they are having difficulty affording insulin.Kasia Lipska is an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. Lipska noticed that more Yale Diabetes Center patients seemed to struggle to pay for insulin, so doctors surveyed patients about whether cost influenced their insulin use.One in four patients responded that cost prompted them to use less insulin than prescribed, take smaller doses, stretch out supplies, not fill a prescription or not start the drug. It was a small study at one center in Connecticut, and researchers can't be certain whether insulin affordability is better or worse in other states.People who struggle to pay are ""more in the middle,"" Lipska says. They don't qualify for Medicaid, the state insurance plan for low-income residents, and some earn too much to qualify for patient-assistance programs.A person with Type 1 diabetes who discontinues the drug might get sick, hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis or die, she says.More: Eli Lilly to introduce generic version of insulin drug Humalog that cuts price in halfThe health problems of diabetics who take less than they need might take longer to detect but can be just as serious.Taking less insulin than prescribed can lead to serious health harms, Lipska says. Those could include a diabetic ulcer, a foot infection that leads to amputation or kidney damage.""We know it's a problem,"" Lipska says. ""The problem leads to, in very severe cases, patients dying, people having complications, people being admitted to the hospital.""'You realize you don't have any left'Blind in one eye and her vision rapidly deteriorating in the other, Sarah Theubet could not afford the medicine her body needed to slow the harmful effects of diabetes.Insulin was too expensive. The uninsured Redding, California, resident could not afford the cost of a drug that had more than tripled since the early 2000s.""It was terrifying,"" Theubet says. ""You are looking at the vial, and you realize you don't have any left.""Theubet turned to friends she met through social media in 2016 and 2017 to solicit insulin donations while she drastically changed her diet so she would not need as much medicine.She ate one low-carbohydrate meal each day that rarely varied: sliced lunch meat and cheese, no bread.She barely had enough energy to make it through classes at Shasta Community College. Vision in her right eye, stabilized this decade from an operation, began to worsen because she could not afford to take insulin as prescribed. She is blind in her left eye.""With the rationing, that was the first year my ophthalmologist noticed a (vision) decline because I was all over the place,"" Theubet says of her insulin use.More: Soaring insulin prices prompt insurance shiftSarah Theubet, 38, has Type 1 diabetes that robbed her of her vision in one eye and will eventually render her blind.Michael Chapman, Redding Record Searchlight via USA TODAY NETWORKBecause she is legally blind, she qualified for Social Security disability in 2017, which includes health insurance through Medicare. She now gets the insulin she needs.Now that her health coverage and access to insulin are stable, she has thrived in the classroom. She will complete her general education studies in the fall and plans to transfer to the University of California-Davis to complete her communication degree.She wants to advocate for the disabled.""I am doing the best I can with what I've been given,"" Theubet says.'Symptom of dysfunctional' systemSome say government needs to step in because the private sector has failed to check price increases.Taylor, a member of the ADA working group, says insulin pricing is emblematic of the nation's health system flaws.Pharmacy benefit managers started to counter pharmaceutical industry's pricing power. As these middlemen gained more clout, they began to demand higher rebates. Drug companies raised prices by amounts that are slightly less than what pharmacy benefit managers demanded.""This is a symptom of a dysfunctional health care system in the United States,"" Taylor says. ""I don't want to put all the blame on the companies. From my point of view, the responsibility is in how our health care system is designed.""More: Big Pharma CEOs tell senators they won't reduce drug costs without other changesCarter, the Dayton-area resident, was hospitalized twice for complications this decade and struggled to afford insulin months before she died, Patterson says.She spent $25 to buy Novolin NPH insulin from Walmart on Dec. 20, according to a receipt the family retrieved from her apartment after her death. Novolin is an older version of human insulin that must be adjusted based on regular blood and glucose testing.""I told her it was pretty unpredictable,"" Patterson says of Novolin. ""You only use it if you have no other option.""Carter was struggling on Christmas Day, feeling nauseous and slurring her words, a roommate told Huber Heights police.The roommate told police she thought Carter's blood-sugar levels were off and urged her to call a doctor or a paramedic.Carter refused, and the roommate left for work. When the roommate returned from work that night, she noticed Carter appeared to be sleeping on the sofa. The following morning, the roommate checked on Carter and realized she had died. The Montgomery County Coroner determined Carter died on Christmas night, but the agency did not consider the death suspicious and did not perform an autopsy. Carter often did not take her insulin as directed, the roommate told police. A family doctor signed her death certificate, listing the cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest.Patterson, whose husband and two sons have Type 1 diabetes, is convinced her sister-in-law experienced a type of complication called diabetic ketoacidosis before she died.She says she desperately wants to see a reformed system so patients can afford the medication they need to live.""The system is broken,"" Patterson says. ""Let's start with transparency, so we can see exactly where it's broken. Then we can see where to fix it.""",https://t.co/B1xevTwBvH,news
How to improve your diabetes management with fasted exercise - Ginger Vieira,"In this week's talk, we'll be conversing with author Ginger Vieira. Ginger is a former record-setting weightlifter turned author. She has written four books and has an active freelance writing career for blogs like Diabetes Strong and HealthLine. We'll be discussing her experiences exercising with diabetes and how exercising in a fasted state is possible to do safely.SummaryGinger's history with powerliftingHow her approach to looking at diabetes in a different light helped herWhy regular blood sugar monitoring is so important (especially when exercising)Why fasting exercising can be so beneficialHow intermittent fasting can help those with diabetesResourcesVideoTranscriptScott Johnson: You ever looked at your blood sugar and thought, boy, I sure messed that one up. Yeah, me too. In fact, it happens more often than I liked to admit. And I tell you what, there's nothing like diabetes to make you second guess your decisions and beat yourself up. But there's a different and better way to go about things, and that's one of the things that we'll be talking about on today's show. What's up monster tamers? Welcome to another episode of ""Live, with Scott!"" thanks so much for tuning in.

Ginger Vieira has lived with type 1 diabetes for 20 years, Celiac disease for 19 years, and fibromyalgia for four years. She's the author of several great books on diabetes including Your Diabetes Science Experiment, Emotional Eating with Diabetes, Dealing with Diabetes Burnout, and Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes. Today, Ginger loves to create freelance content for diabetes work sites like Diabetes Strong and HealthLine. She has two cute little girls who never stop, named Lucy and Violet, two really cute rescue dogs named Suzy and Petey, and a handsome husband with a handsome beard she says.Scott Johnson: They all live in Vermont and wear flannel in the winter just like you'd expect. And you may have seen them on the cover of Health Monitor's Guide to Living with Type 1 Diabetes magazine. Without further ado, let's dive right into the conversation with Ginger.Scott Johnson: Hey Ginger!Ginger Vieira: Hi Scott.Scott Johnson: Thank you for coming on the show. It is wonderful to connect with you again, it feels like it's been a very long time.Ginger Vieira: Yeah and not at all too. I'm, like as you can see, I'm already laughing. Because I just love Scott Johnson.Scott Johnson: Thank you and right back at you. And that's one of the things that I love the most about the community that exists out there and the strength of peer support is that, long periods of time can go by and we pick it right back up where we left off, so thank you for that.Ginger Vieira: Yeah, thank you.Scott Johnson: I know that you're an amazing human being with many, many talents and I would like the world to know much more about you. You've lived with Type 1 diabetes for 20 years, Celiac for 19 years, you're also dealing with fibromyalgia which is a relatively new thing for you, relative to the rest of the things you're dealing with. You have set some impressive records in strength training and things like that and I don't even know what direction to take in the introduction. And I know it's kind of, I don't know I would love for you to help me with this task of introducing such an impressive person as yourself if you don't mind.Ginger Vieira: Very kind overstatement. I want to clear for the record, I have not been weight lifting or setting records for almost like, I don't know, seven years now. That was pre-fibromyalgia, but it taught me a lot, especially about life with diabetes so I'm glad to have that in my history. And I love what I really am. I think I got to know the diabetes community first because of powerlifting, and so I kind of had a meathead persona for a little while because I was always posting videos of 200 pounds deadlifting.Ginger Vieira: But what I really am is a writer, and I wanted to be a writer since the second grade. And I love writing about diabetes. So that is really what my brain craves the most, is to write, and teach and create, particularly about diabetes.Scott Johnson: And I would say you're quite talented at it, a very skilled communicator, especially around complicated topics such as living with diabetes. Author of a number of books that people can go and download, and buy, and we will link all of those in the broadcast. So don't worry we'll fill everyone in on all those great, juicy details. One of the things that we are going to talk about today, we're going to talk about a few things, but one of the things that I love particularly about your approach to life with diabetes is helping people remove the guilt and shame to what they're experiencing with life with diabetes and looking at things a little bit differently. And maybe that's a great place to dive into this conversation today, do you want to talk a little bit more about that?Ginger Vieira: Yeah I mean even as you say that what I think of is, I love cleaning a dirty refrigerator, I love going to someone's house and cleaning a dirty kitchen because if I know that kitchen's still dirty, I just can't, I can't leave it like that right? And diabetes is a big mess like there are just so many things that we have to constantly manage and clean up all day long or keep clean. And so my brain really loves cleaning up that mess and understanding how the mess got there. Sometimes I mean you have to scold your husband and point out the coffee stains, and sometimes it means you have to figure out why your blood sugar is plummeting or skyrocketing during this type of exercise in the morning but not during that type of exercise in the evening.Ginger Vieira: And so when blood sugars don't go the way you expect, I think it's really easy for a certain mindset or a certain habit, or just being a person with diabetes to think, ah I screwed up, I did it wrong. And if you think about the zillion, I mean there's an awesome article on diaTribe about the 44 things that affect blood sugar, but like it feels like there's 44,000, right?Scott Johnson: Yes.Ginger Vieira: Because you can never manage all those things, it's impossible. Even if like half of them are not even able to be managed, we have no control of them and then the other half is like you explode trying to manage and control them all. And so I think it's really, not only important but really freeing to take into account that it's not your fault that your blood sugar wasn't perfect, and as soon as you remove that out of the equation, then you can just look at, oh so if I learn about the exercise physiology of weight lifting versus walking on a treadmill and doing that in the morning on an empty stomach versus, right after I eat lunch, then I can figure out some of those details and get my blood sugar to do more what I want it to do.Ginger Vieira: So it's as soon as you remove the shame and blame because when that shame and guilt is there, there isn't room like you're stuck.Scott Johnson: Yeah you're right. It kind of clouds the, at least for me anyway, it puts me all emotional and I start responding emotionally rather than logically. It makes my brain work from a different space and I'm not able to make smart decisions, I start making kind of knee jerk reactions that often have me swaying way to one side or the other. I think like you mentioned diabetes is, I don't know anything like it that is more prone to kind of sticking these points of data in our face all the time, right? And I think we're also sort of brainwashed to believe that if we do X and Y, then we should get the, one plus one equals two all the time but that's not always the case. So-Ginger Vieira: You know what stinks is we're brainwashed even at our doctor's appointments. It's like they even some people who know so much about diabetes, the medical profession will look at you and be like, ""Well, and why do you think, my body isn't just struggling with insulin production, it also doesn't produce this and doesn't manage this."" And like, that's why I only go to medical professionals for help with diabetes that actually have type 1, because that's never a conversation you have to have. There's never guilt and blame, it's always just problem-solving.Scott Johnson: Yeah. I would say it's almost even, especially, and maybe brainwashed is kind of, it's a very strong word right, like of course these medical-Ginger Vieira: Thought programmed, maybe, yeah.Scott Johnson: And of course it's not an intentional thing, but if you think about the fact that the, how many intricacies there are to managing diabetes as you mentioned, and the amount of time that any of us have with our medical team, how can anyone possibly help us understand everything that we have to think about and consider in a 10 or 15 minute appointment right?Ginger Vieira: And that touches on another thing I'm really passionate about, is that you really do have to study your blood sugars outside of your doctor appointments. You can't wait for every three to six months for them to look at some numbers and be like, ""Oh this is the problem you're having right here."" They aren't going to see it all, you have to be the one that steps back and thinks, every time I go for a job after breakfast, my blood sugar is 45, and then it's 300 an hour later, and you have to be the one that thinks about what those variables are. And there are a million awesome people on the internet now to help with that. But you can't wait for the doctor appointments.Scott Johnson: It's, and I'm going to be totally self-serving from it and I know that we just, we talked about this but you know, logging your information, being very engaged in it, there are a ton of tools out there to help with that, mySugr is one of a handful, and we love logging in data, we have coaches that can help you with that, there are many other tools out there available. But I would, I feel like I would get my hands slapped if I didn't take that opportunity to.Ginger Vieira: Yeah you should. Because it's, I mean you can't just look at it once on a meter and remember.Scott Johnson: Yeah.Ginger Vieira: The mySugr app helps you notice like, oh this is happening every day. Maybe I need to adjust my approach and figure out a different approach to this.Scott Johnson: Yeah. You mentioned a little bit about different types of exercises at different times of day, or exercising after lunch versus fasting, exercising when you're fasting in the morning, something like that. And I know something that you've talked about before is fasted exercise. And that's a term that, okay I can put two and two together in my brain and understand that fasted means I haven't eaten anything, and exercise is exercising. But I would love for you to help me better understand what that means and how it works with diabetes.Ginger Vieira: So, I learned about this actually like maybe 10 years ago from bodybuilders, because the bodybuilding crowd is always trying to burn fat without burning muscle or glucose, right? As soon as you're burning glucose during exercise, you're not burning fat. And bodybuilders, including Schwarzenegger, are always trying to get as lean as possible. And so when I started in the whole weight lifting world 10 years ago, my powerlifting coach, who is a bodybuilder himself was saying, ""You know you really should be,"" they were all very into steady state, just means slow walking in the morning on an empty stomach.Ginger Vieira: And I always thought, I can't do that, I have type 1 diabetes, my blood sugar will plummet. So I would take glucose tabs as I walked, and then my blood sugar would be 300, after an hour, an hour and a half next to my best friend on the treadmill. And he kept telling me, ""You could do fasted cardio, you don't need the glucose tabs."" So I cut down my glucose tabs because I didn't believe him and I finally got down to one glucose tab and it was still high. So I finally cut the glucose tabs and started doing fasted walking on an empty stomach, starting ideally with in-range blood sugar, and of course, a variable that you could throw in there is if, obviously I have my long-acting insulin on board, or you background insulin from a pump.Ginger Vieira: Or let's say at 3:00 AM you woke up and you checked your blood sugar and you were at 200 and you took insulin for that, now there's going to be extra insulin on board when you're doing your fasted cardio–bam, that's a variable thrown in there. Or if you were low at 3:00 AM and you ate, you could still do fasted walking because you didn't take insulin, you just treated the low. If you treated the low with a bowl of cereal, then you're 400. It's a really good motivation to wake up with in-range blood sugar.Scott Johnson: Yeah, yeah.Ginger Vieira: Like when I'm on my kick of getting regular exercise fasted in the morning, at night I'm thinking, what do I need to do to make sure I wake up with the blood sugar I want? Because it will ruin it if it's, you know and I'd be like it will make it less smooth and fun when you wake up.Scott Johnson: Yeah.Ginger Vieira: So the reason you're burning fat for fuel instead of glucose, is because you haven't taken a bolus of insulin. You have your background insulin, I'm just going to emphasize that because always ask, ""Well should I stop taking my background insulin?"" We all need insulin to live, you need your background insulin, leave it alone. For the first few times somebody might try this, always keep glucose in your pocket or nearby wherever you are. And I always assume for the potential to have a low blood sugar when I'm exercising. Any plummet of any time of day. But check when you start, check halfway through, check at the end and see what's happening.Ginger Vieira: If someone was to have a low blood sugar during fasted cardio and those other variables of having taken insulin for a high and things like that aren't on board, that's a great way to know that you're actually getting too much background insulin.Scott Johnson: Yeah.Ginger Vieira: So your body is burning fat for fuel because you haven't introduced calories or insulin. So it's still in a fasted state. And not only does that mean that you're burning more body fat, it means that you can exercise without low blood sugars.Scott Johnson: Awesome.Ginger Vieira: Yeah. So the other side of this though is that it doesn't have to be on a treadmill like a bodybuilder. When I was still weight lifting prior to fibromyalgia, I would weight lift in a fasted state and I actually would take a unit of insulin to counter the way weight lifting can raise your blood sugar. And again everybody should approach this – because I'm describing Ginger's body. I waited until I had three days of evidence that my morning fasted weight lifting raised my blood sugar, and then I was like, all right, I'm definitely going to take a unit of insulin for when I start this workout. And that meant that I could be at 100 at the end of my work out instead of 250. I'm going to pause there I can go on and on.Scott Johnson: Yeah no this is great information. I mean it's, I think that you mentioned one big thing there where so many of us with diabetes who are taking insulin, we struggle with those lows during exercise. And so this is-Ginger Vieira: They ruin all the fun.Scott Johnson: Right, it totally ruins all the fun and we often feel like we're eating all the calories that we just worked off in the gym and stuff like that. So it sounds to me like this fasted exercise can be one great strategy to help with that.Ginger Vieira: For me it's freedom, and I have two little kids now and I do not have the power inside me to wake up at 5:00 AM and exercise prior to them waking up. I've tried it fails miserably. And it's like I hate life for the rest of the day if I have to get out of bed that early. So I don't get to exercise until after I bring them to school, and by then it's like 8:30 that I could get on a treadmill. I do walk the dogs in the morning, so I am getting that fasted exercise at 7:00, but when I'm stepping on a treadmill and getting, really clear diligent exercise, is 8:30.Ginger Vieira: So now that's going in a little further, and I want to add another variable that people can experience when fasting, whether you're doing fasted exercise or just fasting, your liver can dump glucose because you're liver is like, oh you're not eating breakfast, I'm going to provide a little fuel, here's some glucose. And that really would happen in a non-diabetic too, so I would take a unit of, and I always check to make sure if that's happening or not happening, and I can have phases where that fasting causes me to need a unit of insulin in the morning to kind of support my basal insulin needs because of that liver dump. And I can have periods where for some reason I don't, I think it's really in the summer where I don't because I'm so much more active in the summer. But I just want to illustrate that that can vary.Scott Johnson: Definitely. So it's all about kind of doing, tracking your information, and paying attention.Ginger Vieira: Paying attention, yeah. If you fast and you exercise and your blood sugar goes high and it happens consistently, two, three days in a row, it doesn't mean that you suck at fasting or that it's not possible for you, it means that you just need probably a unit of insulin on board when you start your fasting exercise. And that doesn't cancel out the benefits of fasted exercise, it's your background insulin needs.Scott Johnson: Yeah. Something I'm curious about, you mentioned earlier about the bodybuilders and weight lifters doing slow walking. Talk a little bit more about that, why would they keep it slow versus you know like really get it going and-Ginger Vieira: I'd always take things to like another level of obsession. And I don't always think it's healthy. And many aspects of bodybuilding, it's not. And that is their obsession with making sure they don't burn any muscle. Because if your heart rate's low enough, you're only going to burn body fat not muscle and we cannot lose an ounce of muscle for bodybuilders. My hats go off to them, but I think the average person shouldn't worry about that, I think you should have fun.Scott Johnson: Yeah just go for a walk, do whatever exercise you want to do and-Ginger Vieira: Go for a jog, you can go weight lift, you can go row a boat, jump rope, just go have fun.Scott Johnson: Go have fun, that's awesome.Ginger Vieira: And so not everybody has time to exercise in the morning and for a while, I really didn't beyond walking the dogs because my kids weren't at school, they're pretty little. I have a one-and-a-half-year-old and a four-year-old, so they're still pretty needy. And when they aren't at school, I can't do that, I have them at home. And I needed, I wanted to create that freedom of fasted exercise in the evening. So I would eat my, we know that fast-acting insulin stays in your body for three to four hours, the more common ones, Novolog and Humalog. And so I would make sure to eat my last meal that really required insulin around 3:00 or 4:00 PM because my kids are in bed by 7:00.Ginger Vieira: So then I wouldn't, if I did between 3:00 or 4:00 PM and 7:00, it would be something light, or it would at the very least be very low carb, or if it was carbs it was like veggies where you take a little bit of insulin that's not going to hurt. So then at 7:00 PM, kids are unconscious, and I can go out to the garage where I've got my jump rope or my treadmill, and I can exercise for an hour and my blood sugar doesn't plummet.Scott Johnson: Nice.Ginger Vieira: So it's creating fast exercise at the time that's ideal for you. If you need to do that for lunchtime, you can eat your breakfast, and then wait until after you exercise to eat lunch. Don't eat lunch, and people always say to me but, ""If I don't eat breakfast before I exercise, won't I pass out?"" No, the human body is a little more durable than that. We can, I know humans are so used to like, you got to eat every three to four hours. But you'll make it, I promise. And even feels good, it feels good to me because my blood sugar isn't fluctuating, and I don't have food in my belly and it's just freedom.Scott Johnson: I love that. Now I have another question for you, now just to put this out there, you're not a medical professional, you're-Ginger Vieira: I am not.Scott Johnson: But I think you're pretty darn smart about a lot of this stuff. But just for the record, all of you watching, Ginger is not a medical professional, and of course, if you feel uncomfortable answering any of this, then please just say so. But what might be the differences, or some of the differences you know about, what we're talking about between someone living with type 1 or type 2 using insulin, versus the benefits of fasted exercise for someone with type 2 diabetes who might not be taking insulin?Ginger Vieira: Yeah so you need to take about what medications you are taking that do lower blood sugar. Like metformin helps your blood sugar be lower, but metformin doesn't lower blood sugars. But there are other, I mean there are so many diabetes drugs out there that, maybe I don't even know, maybe a third of them, half of them lower blood sugar and half of them don't, right? So have that conversation with your doctor if you're not sure. But if you normally take your diabetes medication at 7:00 AM because you take it with your breakfast, if you're doing fasted exercise, you're probably, and again check on this with your healthcare team, but you're probably not going to want to take your med at 7:00 AM, you're going to want to take it when you do eat your first meal.Scott Johnson: Yeah. And also the body is, in type 2 diabetes this action is disrupted a bit, but the body's natural action of when you eat a meal is to release insulin amongst a number of other things. But by fasting you're not triggering that and that sounds like what this is all about. That leads to another question, is there anyone out there who maybe should not practice fasted exercise?Ginger Vieira: I mean if you already, I wouldn't say there's a hard and fast, if you have a history of eating disorders or exercise anorexia, avoiding food in that kind of way could be a real trigger for other issues. So I would steer someone away from that unless that's part of your current program. And if you need help with any type of eating disorder as a person with diabetes, you should go to wearediabetes.org and find Asha Brown without question. Aside from that, I mean if you have low blood pressure and you know that exercise is already a risk for you, maybe that person, but really the blood sugar is the main issue, low blood sugars are the main concern.Ginger Vieira: Start your fasted exercise with something that's not crazy. Like, don't go to CrossFit fasted the first time you do fasted exercise. Just go for a walk, a jog, whatever and see how you-Scott Johnson: Pay attention to your body and numbers.Ginger Vieira: Check often and see how you feel. Anytime I do any type of new exercise, even if I think I know how it's going to affect my body, like for a little while I was trying to like swimming and I'm not sure which part of that is swimming, I mean I'm swimming it's definitely in quotes. But and the liking swimming is also in quotes. But even though I knew that swimming is cardio and I'm doing it in a fasted state, I still got out of the pool every 15 minutes to see what was happening to my blood sugar because I've never done something as awful as swimming before that really for exercise. So as you can see I don't do it anymore.Scott Johnson: That's funny, I love that. I'm also curious about the difference between fasted exercise, and another term or phrase I hear often is intermittent fasting. Can you help me and us better understand what the differences are a little bit better?Ginger Vieira: Yeah. Fasted exercise is all about just creating a fasted environment during your exercise so that you're burning fat for fuel, but then you eat after, right? And if I do fasted exercise at 7:00 PM, I've only been fasted for like three and a half hours. So that's like barely fasting, for a Type 1 diabetic it's plenty of fasting because I get the benefits of that freedom during my workout at 7:00 PM. Intermittent fasting implies eating your caloric needs within a certain window of time, and let's say it's 1:00 PM to 8:00 PM or 1:00 PM to 10:00 PM and then not eating over all the hours around that.Ginger Vieira: And it's for similar benefits in terms of burning fat for fuel. A lot of research has shown that that break for your digestive system extends our lives and is so good for our body and our digestive system to just not be constantly shoving food down our throat. Again, anyone with a history of eating disorders should not do intermittent fasting or even contemplate it. Anyone struggling with yo-yo dieting, you really want to focus on your relationship with choosing mostly healthy foods before you pursue intermittent fasting. I had a friend who was really struggling with, he would just binge eat in the middle of the day, because he didn't realize that he wasn't eating really much of anything for a huge other chunk of time.Ginger Vieira: And sure he was sort of creating his own lanky intermittent fasting schedule, but the choices he was making around food were not even remotely healthy or like a mental connection with what he was eating. So that intermittent fasting is not a solution for yo-yo dieting. First focus on eating 80% of your day just really good food, room for 20% of healthy treats, whatever is delicious to you, bread and butter, whatever you got to have you know, that makes you not feel deprived. For me that's chocolate. And then if you feel like pursuing intermittent fasting, we have Diabetes Strong, it's pretty much the only thorough write up on intermittent fasting with type 1 diabetes, and it would apply to type 2 on insulin.Ginger Vieira: And then another great resource for intermittent fasting is by Dr. John Berardi, Precision Nutrition, and he has this awesome eBook on all the different types of intermittent fasting, schedules you can follow and what the point is and what happens when you abuse that schedule. One of his colleagues that wrote this she thought, ""Oh I just did a 24 hour fast."" You know if you eat normally six days a week and then you do one day of 24-hour fasting, that's one type of intermittent fasting. So she thought, ""Oh that was great, I'm going to do another one."" So she ate dinner, but then she did another 24-hour fast rope, she's not going to eat again until the next dinner.Ginger Vieira: And then I think she tried to do it again. And she found herself wanting to just dip a stick of butter in sugar because that was too much. There's a degree of fasting that's healthy and there's, like any good thing, you can ruin it. So, and I find that intermittent fasting has been awesome for periods of my life, like maybe for a few months, and then I just suddenly find that like my body is still stressed out about that, and I'm not going to do that, I'm going to just eat breakfast and eat a more normal schedule. I also want to emphasize that when you are doing intermittent fasting no matter what the schedule is, it's still important you're still trying to get the same amount of calories, you're still trying to get a day's worth of calories. The health benefits and the weight loss benefits are not because you're eating less necessarily.Scott Johnson: Got you. That's great. Well we will be sure to check on those resources on Diabetes Strong and the doctor you mentioned and get those links out there for folks to take a look, that's great, thank you for sharing those. Ginger we've covered a lot of great information already, is there anything that you can think of that you'd like to spend a little more time on, or anything that we may not have covered that you want to talk about?Ginger Vieira: You know the first thing that comes to mind is we already as people with diabetes have such an emphasis on nutrition, nutrition, nutrition, right? And because of social media, there's always the good and bad of social media. And on Instagram especially, there are so many fitness gurus, and people prepping for their next bikini competition or their body building competition, and they've got all their meals prepped out. And we're all privy to that in the diabetes world too because we have to pay so much attention to food. I just want to say having been very close to people with diabetes in the body building world, that you don't have to prepare four meals a day, seven days ahead and live your life like some kind of nutrition robot, to be healthy.Ginger Vieira: And a lot, a lot, a lot of those people rebound later on and they don't share that with you on Instagram. And I just wish it was more honest on social media because it's, I feel like I can't go anywhere without seeing another person telling me about their meal prep and preparing and trying to get their six pack. And I can tell now, because I've been around that world long enough, of which girls have suddenly started doing anabolic steroids in low doses and suddenly they look like this and their waist is like this, and you just, I want to just put a filter on that for everybody.Ginger Vieira: And in the diabetes world, we're so sensitive to that stuff, I just want to really encourage people to tone it out or back away, or just remember that you're not seeing the whole picture of what's going on.Scott Johnson: That's really wise to remember that especially looking at everything we see on our screens. So thank you for the reminder. And as a public service to everyone out there, I have spared all of you from my bikini contest pictures so you're welcome in advance. I'm just kidding, I wouldn't do that. Well, this has been a fantastic conversation Ginger, thank you very much for coming on and sharing a little taste of what's in that brilliant mind of yours with us-Ginger Vieira: The rest of it is just chocolate recipes. What kind of chocolate mousse I want to make tomorrow.Scott Johnson: That's also information the world should have too. So we're going to put as many of the links to all your great works and books and places people can track you down at as I can fit on the screen out there for people, and we'd love to have you back any time that you've got something more to share. And please reach out, let us know whenever we can have.Ginger Vieira: Thanks Scott, thanks for having me.Scott Johnson: All right. There you have it. I hope you also enjoyed the conversation with Ginger and learning some new tools and perspective. And as a special thanks to all of you watching, I have a fun mySugr tote bag with some goodies inside like mySugr pop socket and a few stickers, and I even tracked down another autographed copy of Adam Brown's Bright Spots &amp; Landmines book that I want to give away. To enter, leave a comment below and let Ginger and I if you enjoyed today's episode. And before next week's show, I'll randomly pick a lucky winner or two and announce them during the start of next week's broadcast.Scott Johnson: Now I want to share a quick heads up about a fun event that we're hosting right here at the mySugr office on Friday. The amazing Erik and Annalisa recently kicked off their west coast, Miles of Portraits Tour. Where they'll be cycling from Los Angeles California, all the way to Santa Fe New Mexico over the next two to three months. They're stopping and speaking at a number of REI and JDRF locations along the way and we're lucky enough that they'll be popping in to the mySugr office here in Encinitas, California as they make their way south from LA through Carlsbad, Encinitas, down to San Diego, before heading east into the other tour stops on their way.Scott Johnson: So, they're going to be doing a fun meet and greet between 6:00 and 8:00 PM this Friday. If you happen to be nearby, please drop in, we'd love to see you, there's going to be tons of cool people, casual atmosphere, just drop in, no RSVP needed. We'll have some light refreshments and snacks, and yeah grab a picture. Ask them like what is this crazy bike touring thing all about? This is something they've done before, they biked across Alaska, and have ridden across the United States of America, I mean so many questions about all this stuff and you will have a chance to talk with them in person.Scott Johnson: If you know Erik, you also know that he is an amazing storyteller who makes a lot of great videos as well so I'm sure he'll create some content, I'll capture some content as well and share some updates as well. So in addition, I also want to share something I'm also very excited about. So you've heard me talk about Diabetes Training Camp before, at least I hope you have, and I'm excited to share that they've added a Type 2 Diabetes Boot Camp to their lineup. I'm going to read the description right from their website here. Diabetes Training Camp's Type 2 Boot Camp is an extremely unique program geared towards everyone with type 2 diabetes.Scott Johnson: Learn the simple facts on developing a healthy lifestyle and fitness program, that will help you take control of your diabetes.

A High-Tech Pill to End Drug Injections,"Here was the challenge for bioengineers: Find a way for patients to take drugs — like insulin or monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancers and other diseases — without injections.The medicines are made of molecules too big to be absorbed through the stomach or intestines; in any event, the drugs would be quickly degraded by the body's harsh digestive system. Now, a team of scientists may have found a solution that delivers these drugs in a capsule a person can swallow. Their inspiration? A tortoise that always rights itself after rolling over.The test device, called Soma, is shaped like the tortoise's shell. Inside is a miniature post made of insulin. After the tiny device positions itself against the stomach wall, the post pops out and injects insulin. The device then travels through the colon and eventually is eliminated by the patient.The device works in rats and pigs, the investigators reported on Thursday in the journal Science. The researchers — at M.I.T., Harvard and Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company — hope to start testing Soma in humans in three years.Outside experts said the device may well be a viable solution to the injection problem. ""It's a very new concept and a really cool idea,"" said Edith Mathiowitz, a professor of medical science and engineering at Brown University.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]While sounding like something out of science fiction, Soma synthesizes a number of recent engineering advances, experts said.""What they have done is taken ideas from many areas and integrated them,"" said Tejal Desai, chair of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. The researchers knew that if they could get a drug through the wall of the stomach, the medicine would enter the bloodstream. Because the stomach does not have many pain receptors, a prick from the tiny post would not even be felt.Creating a device to accomplish this required three key advances, said Dr. Giovanni Traverso, a gastroenterologist at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and a lead author of the paper.The first challenge was to make a device that would land on the stomach in a predictable way. For ideas, the researchers looked to nature — and discovered the leopard tortoise. An angled shell helps the tortoise roll back onto its feet no matter which way it falls. The engineers decided to imitate the tortoise's shape with a tiny device that would always land on the wall of the stomach, in the right orientation, no matter how it tumbled down the esophagus.Next, they needed a cue that would trigger the release of a tiny post made of insulin that they would put in the device.""The stomach is moist and humid,"" Dr. Traverso said. ""That was the key clue.""That sort of environment will dissolve sugar, as a lozenge or candy dissolves in your mouth. The insulin needle was compressed like a spring and held in place with a thin disc of sugar. By controlling the size of the disc, the researchers were able to control how long the mechanism would stay intact. They decided on five minutes: When the sugar dissolved, the insulin post would pop out.Finally, they had to make that tiny insulin post. The device that would hold it is small, the size of a pea, which restricted how much drug it could contain. By experimenting with dried insulin, compressed under different pressures, the group discovered a way to make little insulin posts that were stable enough and composed of enough insulin to do the job.As it's conceived now, a patient swallows a capsule containing the device, said Robert Langer, a chemical engineer at M.I.T. The capsule dissolves in ten minutes, and the device lands on the stomach wall. The sugar disc shatters five minutes later, releasing the post. It pokes through the stomach wall, delivering insulin to the bloodstream. Eventually, the device is excreted; patients should not even notice it. In tests with pigs and rats, led by Alex Abramson, a doctoral student at M.I.T., the device delivered as much insulin as a conventional injection. But the stomach had to be empty when the animals swallowed the capsules.Much work remains — more tests for safety and to make sure that frequent injections do not damage the stomach, for example.But the hope is that the device would be used for an array of injected drugs, not just for insulin. ""Insulin is a proof of concept,"" Dr. Langer said.",https://t.co/86aA1DyOiv,news
Why I Am Stockpiling Insulin in My Fridge,"What I didn't expect, what I still can't fathom, is that insulin prices would skyrocket so much. The price of my insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, with average costs per patient rising to nearly $6,000 a year. I definitely never thought that in 2019 there would be people who would die from lack of access. Many insulin-dependent people with diabetes in America, right now, even people with health insurance, are having financial trouble meeting their most basic need. I recently read about a nurse named Meaghan Carter, whose family said that she died when she lost her insurance in 2018, after she had lived with diabetes for more than 18 years. In 2017, a man from Houston died after his GoFundMe for insulin came up $50 short. GoFundMe yielded more than 8,000 results when I searched for ""insulin."" If my childhood impressions of the future were more sci-fi than realistic, then I never imagined the current state of diabetes management would be dystopic, with so many patients in our rich nation rationing their doses, trying to make little glass vials of life blood last as long as possible while drug companies make a hefty profit.Diabetics like me need insulin to process the sugar in our blood in order to live. With too little insulin to manage the food we eat, our blood sugars climb. I've struggled for years to describe what it feels like to have high blood sugar: All my energy is sapped away. I'm thirsty and sluggish, and my calves tend to cramp. It feels like a panic attack. I can never separate what high feels like from what anxious feels like because both feelings tend to develop together in a self-perpetuating ball, along with guilt. I feel guilty, whether the high is my ""fault"" or not (did I eat cake?), because I'm supposed to be in control of my disease, damn it. When I'm high, I inject insulin into my belly as quickly as possible and hope to find a nice place to rest while the insulin works its magic.That need for insulin takes center stage in my subconscious and many of my stress nightmares: My blood sugar is high but I can't find my insulin in my purse, my version of showing up naked to class for a test I didn't study for. I test my blood sugar and I get a result in the thousands (normal for me is around 100) and I try to fathom the ways in which my body will betray me. I'm a prisoner trapped on a plane without my insulin, feeling sicker and sicker, and I have to rely on Nicolas Cage to beat up some bad guys and find spare insulin to bring me. O.K., that's not a nightmare, that's the plot of the movie ""Con Air,"" but I certainly had a panic attack while seeing it with my parents as a teenager.",https://t.co/pqvHciN0eD,news
'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar.

The price of my insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, with average costs per patient rising to nearly $6,000 a year. I definitely never thought that in 2019 there would be people who would die from lack of access. Many insulin-dependent people with diabetes in America, right now, even people with health insurance, are having financial trouble meeting their most basic need. I recently read about a nurse named Meaghan Carter, whose family said that she died when she lost her insurance in 2018, after she had lived with diabetes for more than 18 years. In 2017, a man from Houston died after his GoFundMe for insulin came up $50 short. GoFundMe yielded more than 8,000 results when I searched for ""insulin."" If my childhood impressions of the future were more sci-fi than realistic, then I never imagined the current state of diabetes management would be dystopic, with so many patients in our rich nation rationing their doses, trying to make little glass vials of life blood last as long as possible while drug companies make a hefty profit.Diabetics like me need insulin to process the sugar in our blood in order to live. With too little insulin to manage the food we eat, our blood sugars climb. I've struggled for years to describe what it feels like to have high blood sugar: All my energy is sapped away. I'm thirsty and sluggish, and my calves tend to cramp. It feels like a panic attack. I can never separate what high feels like from what anxious feels like because both feelings tend to develop together in a self-perpetuating ball, along with guilt. I feel guilty, whether the high is my ""fault"" or not (did I eat cake?), because I'm supposed to be in control of my disease, damn it. When I'm high, I inject insulin into my belly as quickly as possible and hope to find a nice place to rest while the insulin works its magic.That need for insulin takes center stage in my subconscious and many of my stress nightmares: My blood sugar is high but I can't find my insulin in my purse, my version of showing up naked to class for a test I didn't study for. I test my blood sugar and I get a result in the thousands (normal for me is around 100) and I try to fathom the ways in which my body will betray me. I'm a prisoner trapped on a plane without my insulin, feeling sicker and sicker, and I have to rely on Nicolas Cage to beat up some bad guys and find spare insulin to bring me. O.K., that's not a nightmare, that's the plot of the movie ""Con Air,"" but I certainly had a panic attack while seeing it with my parents as a teenager.",https://t.co/SrlbuMTtnr,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/H8m27k50UB,news

Eli Lilly discloses pricing data for its popular insulin Humalog,"A box of Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Humalog brand kwikpen insulin delivery devices are arranged for a photograph at a pharmacy in Princeton, Illinois.Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly pulled the curtain back on the confidential pricing structure for one of its blockbuster drugs Monday, disclosing for the first time what it charges wholesalers versus what many patients typically pay.The company's list prices for its popular insulin injection Humalog, versus what most patients are charged after insurance company rebates and other discounts, highlight the disparity in prices between uninsured and insured patients. The move is also a pre-emptive one as the Trump administration and Congress pressure drugmakers for more transparency and to lower drug costs.The ""net price "" patients actually pay for Eli Lilly's insulin fell by 8.1 percent to $135 a patient per month in 2018 from $147 in 2014, the company said in a shareholder report released Monday. The net price is the total paid after factoring in rebates and discounts. The insulin's average list price before the discounts rose 51.9 percent to $594 per patient each month. ""We believe that the additional information disclosed ... will provide greater transparency into the significant rebates and discounts we provide to payers and other supply chain entities for this important medicine,"" the company said in a statement to CNBC.The report comes after the Senate Finance Committee, led by Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., launched an investigation into rising insulin prices, writing to Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, asking them why the cost of the nearly 100-year-old medication had rapidly risen.High drug costs have become a rare bipartisan issue with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle demanding something be done. President Donald Trump has made lowering prices one of the key issues of his administration. Democrats are jockeying to prove they can lead reform.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than 30 million Americans have diabetes. The annual cost of insulin for people with Type 1 diabetes in the U.S. nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016 to $5,700 from $2,900.Drugmakers argue these prices are simply the price that's advertised, not what consumers actually pay. But people without insurance may be forced to pay upfront, sometimes leaving them with a mountain of debt.Drug companies have blamed pharmacy benefit managers, sometimes called middlemen, for the sticker shock some patients see at the counter. Drugmakers argue that PBMs should pass the rebates negotiated with manufactures along to patients.The Trump administration earlier this year proposed a rule to end the industry-wide system of rebates, a change that Lilly and other pharmaceutical companies welcomed.Earlier this month, Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a half-price version of Humalog. The rebranded product called Insulin Lispro would be $137.35 per vial. Humalog, which makes $3 billion in annual sales, will remain available, Eli Lilly said.Eli Lilly, with a market cap of more than more than $132 billion, has seen its share rise 67.7 percent over a 12-month period. The stock is up more than 10 percent this year.--Reuters contributed to this report.",https://t.co/vi2mdA70TN,news
Sanofi turns to subscriptions to offer patients insulin at $99 per month,"Louisiana has garnered plenty of headlines for its new ""Netflix"" approach to buying hepatitis C drugs. Now, Sanofi has unveiled a program that takes that model directly to patients, supplying insulin products for a flat monthly rate. The French drugmaker will use its Insulin Valyou Savings Program, which launched in a smaller form last year, to deliver its insulin products for $99 per month. At that fixed price, Sanofi will offer up to 10 boxes of insulin pens and 10 mL vials per month regardless of a patient's income.The new plan comes as insulin has become a flash point in the drug pricing debate. It's designed for people who are exposed to high out-of-pocket costs—such as uninsured patients—and for those who don't qualify for other access programs, a spokesman said. It'll take effect in June. Last year, Sanofi introduced the Insulin Valyou Savings Program to offer its basal insulin Lantus and mealtime insulin Admelog at $99 for one 10 mL vial or $149 for a box of pens. The company later expanded the program to cover all its insulins.The new $99-per-month price could be as little as one-tenth the amount patients would have paid before. The new structure can cover the full cost of patients' needs and allow patients to mix and match vials and packs, plus insulin types, Adam Gluck, Sanofi's head of U.S. external affairs, told FiercePharma. FierceBiotech Executive BreakfastGetting Real: The Changing Tide on Real-World Evidence in Drug DevelopmentJoin FierceBiotech and a panel of industry experts for an executive breakfast at BIO. We will discuss the impacts of real-world evidence on drug development and address the important questions that companies are facing including where to find the right talent &amp; technology and how to deploy it internally or with partners. Join us in Philadelphia on June 5th for this important discussion. RELATED: Now that Lilly has a cheaper generic Humalog, will Novo Nordisk and Sanofi follow?The company's initial savings program made a difference for patients who had been paying list prices, said Michelle Carnahan, the company's head of primary care in North America. But many patients needed more help. Sanofi went with the savings program approach, versus an authorized generic or list price cut, because it has full control over its access program, she said in an interview.The drug pricing system ""has so many unknowns and different pieces that we don't fully control, it becomes hard to make change,"" she said. Alternatively, ""this is something that we can fully own.""One drawback is that Sanofi can't offer the savings program to patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Sanofi said it supports changes to regulations that would allow Medicare and other patients to participate. Sanofi's move comes only a week after Cigna and Express Scripts unveiled a $25-per-month cap to insured patients' out-of-pocket insulin costs.Wednesday's announcement is the latest move by an insulin maker to address access and affordability questions. For years, Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have faced investigations, lawsuits and criticism from patients over prices, which have been sharply climbing.But drugmakers argue growing rebates are part of the problem. Eli Lilly recently disclosed that it raised Humalog's list price 52% over five years, but due to growing rebates and discounts, the drug's net price fell 8% over the same period. Sanofi itself paid out 55% of its U.S. gross sales in the form of rebates last year, including $4.5 billion in mandated rebates to government payers and $7.3 billion in ""discretionary rebates."" To address the pricing criticism, Eli Lilly recently released an authorized generic to Humalog at a 50% discount to the branded version.",https://t.co/KwvEXIIP5X,news

Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Obesity-Induced Hypothalamic Inflammation and Insulin Resistance: Pivotal Role of Resistin/TLR4 Pathways.,"Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Obesity-Induced Hypothalamic Inflammation and Insulin Resistance: Pivotal Role of Resistin/TLR4 Pathways.Summary of ""Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Obesity-Induced Hypothalamic Inflammation and Insulin Resistance: Pivotal Role of Resistin/TLR4 Pathways.""Low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance are among the clinical features of obesity that are thought to promote the progressive onset of type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms linking these disorders remain not fully understood. Recent reports pointed out hypothalamic inflammation as a major step in the onset of obesity-induced insulin resistance. In light of the increasing prevalence of obesity and T2D, two worldwide public health concerns, deciphering mechanisms implicated in hypothalamic inflammation constitutes a major challenge in the field of insulin-resistance/obesity. Several clinical and experimental studies have identified resistin as a key hormone linking insulin-resistance to obesity, notably through the activation of Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 4 signaling pathways. In this review, we present an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-induced hypothalamic inflammation and insulin resistance with peculiar focus on the role of resistin/TLR4 signaling pathway.AffiliationJournal DetailsThis article was published in the following journal.Name: Frontiers in endocrinologyISSN: 1664-2392Pages: 140Links Medical and Biotech [MESH] DefinitionsInsulin ResistanceDiminished effectiveness of INSULIN in lowering blood sugar levels: requiring the use of 200 units or more of insulin per day to prevent HYPERGLYCEMIA or KETOSIS. It can be caused by the presence of INSULIN ANTIBODIES or the abnormalities in insulin receptors (RECEPTOR, INSULIN) on target cell surfaces.

Walmart's $25 insulin can't fix the diabetes drug price crisis,"Health care executives faced the ire of lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday, amid a growing outcry from patients who've been forced to ration insulin because of soaring prices.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) told a panel of insulin manufacturers and drug industry intermediaries assembled for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on insulin prices. ""I just want you to know your days are numbered.""While the executives fumbled to explain themselves over the course of two days of questioning, one ""solution"" to the insulin access crisis resurfaced on social media: Patients should just buy cheap insulin at Walmart.For context, the cost of the four most popular insulins has tripled over the past decade, forcing many of the millions of Americans with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who rely on the drug to skimp on or skip doses. Walmart indeed offers a relatively inexpensive choice, essentially over the counter. People can go to pharmacies in stores nationwide and, without a prescription, purchase a vial of Novo Nordisk's Novolin ReliOn Insulin for less than $25. (People with diabetes can require between one and six vials of insulin per month.)But there's a problem here: This low-cost option is far from ideal for all patients. Ultimately, ""Walmart-ism,"" as diabetes advocates call it, reveals a lot about what the debate around the insulin drug pricing crisis has become: a big blame game, filled with distractions from what's really driving up drug prices. The problems with Walmart's insulinDoctors and diabetes advocates point out that while ReliOn may help patients in a pinch, especially those without health insurance, it's also a formulation (known as ""human"" insulin) that came on the market in the 1980s, more than a decade before more refined insulins started to emerge. The newer insulins, known as analogs, appear to be more effective at preventing dangerous blood sugar swings in people with Type 1 diabetes or those at a higher risk for severe low blood sugar. (The evidence of insulin analog's benefits is less clear for Type 2 diabetes, but the studies are also low quality so it's difficult to make conclusive statements.) There's one more problem: Because it's available without a prescription, patients can get the drug without the supervision of a doctor, and they sometimes get into trouble as a result. So stories have surfaced about patients who required emergency care because of severe blood sugar highs and lows after self-dosing with Walmart insulin, or even dying as a result. ""Human insulins are a reasonable option for many patients with Type 2 diabetes,"" said Yale endocrinologist Kasia Lipska, who often prescribes the drugs for patients who can't afford newer formulations. ""But the drug isn't optimal for everybody. And human insulin sold at Walmart is definitely not the solution to our insulin crisis.""For people with Type 1 diabetes, human insulins ""are harder to live on, lead to worse control, make it harder to hold down a job, impact quality of life,"" said James Elliott, a trustee at T1International, an independent patient advocacy group, ""and not everyone lives near a Walmart."" A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the low-cost formulation is also available at CVS and Express Scripps, though patients have to apply for a discount program first. ""We have taken numerous steps to help make insulin more affordable for people living with diabetes,"" the spokesperson said. ""Approximately 775,000 people in the US use our human insulin."" So while it's true that Walmart offers insulin at a competitive price reminiscent of the days before insulin costs tripled and that it can be helpful for some patients, it's not great for everybody with diabetes, and it can be dangerous for some. Walmart-ism is part of the insulin drug pricing blame gameThe Walmart solution first went viral in February, after it was featured on TV in Texas and then posted to Facebook. It continues to be bandied about on social media whenever people mention rising insulin prices. According to the meme, the problem isn't that insulin is too expensive. The problem is that patients are too picky to take advantage of an affordable insulin option. According to the pharmacy benefit managers testifying before Congress Tuesday, it's the insulin manufacturers' companies that are driving up the cost of the drug. At another congressional hearing Wednesday, pharmaceutical company executives blamed pharmacy benefit managers for helping inflate prices and boasted about their financial assistance programs as solutions to the access crisis. The blame game involves many fingers pointing in many directions, but make no mistake: What's driving up insulin costs is that drug companies have raised prices because they can. As I recently explained, the US is an outlier in insulin costs and spending. America represents only 15 percent of the global insulin market and generates almost half of the pharmaceutical industry's insulin revenue. Although insulin was discovered a century ago, manufacturers have made incremental changes to their formulations that have allowed them to extend the patents for these drugs. Even where patents have expired, the road to getting generic insulin on the market is so complicated and expensive that recent attempts have failed.So how did we get here? Unlike other countries, America gives drug companies free rein to set prices. The result is that the cost of the four most popular types of insulin has tripled over the past decade, and the out-of-pocket prescription costs patients now face have doubled. Let's break that down with some dollar figures. By 2016, the average list price of insulin rose to $450 per month. Patients can wind up paying out of pocket anything from $25 per month, if they have generous health insurance coverage or buy older insulin versions at Walmart, to more than $1,000 if they don't have insurance or have a high deductible plan, according to T1International. One quick fix to improve insulin access Lately there's been more attention on the insulin pricing problem. Members of Congress have been pressuring drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers to bring insulin costs under control. Last Wednesday, the insurance behemoth Cigna, and its pharmacy benefit arm Express Scripts, announced a new program that'll cap the 30-day cost of insulin at $25. That's a 40 percent reduction from the $41.50-per-month fee people with Express Scripts benefits were paying in 2018.This week, Sanofi announced it will offer its insulin products at $99 per month for uninsured patients. But like the Walmart option, these programs amount to Band-Aid solutions, said Elizabeth Pfiester, the founder and executive director of T1International. With Walmart, patients are ""having to revert to an older insulin that can damage you,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Sanofi and Cigna programs ""can be shut down or rescinded at any time. That's not any kind of assurance for patients."" ""Patients will not fall for these fake measures that do nothing to solve the crisis we are facing,"" she added.There's one way the insulin drug pricing problem could be fixed, however: lowering the price of insulin, said Yale's Lipska. ""Ultimately, it's the list price that's hurting patients. I keep going back to that: Just fix the list price."" Companies could decide that instead of launching one-off programs or doling out discounts, they'll forgo profits and lower list prices once and for all. Or lawmakers could decide to regulate drug pricing. ""We have a big problem here,"" Lipska said. ""People are hurting and people are dying. How much more will it take for them to regulate this? Clearly what's in place now is not working. This is a place where our legislators can step in and help protect the patients with diabetes.""

Personalized Intervention for Type 2's Using Insulin Improves Adherence,"Intensive insulin-adherence interventions that target type 2 diabetes patients with high risk of noncompliance can be beneficial.Among patients with type 2 diabetes, poor medication adherence remains the main reason for adverse outcomes and increased costs. Within all antidiabetic therapies, insulin therapy appears to be among the most non-complied drugs due to the anxiety that comes from administration (self-injection) and fear of hypoglycemia. While there are many complicated obstacles to optimal medication use, interventions intended to improve medication compliance are often simple and only somewhat effective. Successfully targeting medication compliance, particularly for those patients who would benefit the most, may potentially lead to the therapy improvement, but so far this proposition has not been sufficiently assessed.A study published in JAMA, March, 2019, evaluated the effectiveness of giving resources to help medication adherence to a subgroup of type 2 diabetes patients who benefit the most, versus helping all patients with type 2 diabetes to a smaller degree. This study proposes that with a limited set of resources, hospitals and practitioners should try to target high intensity interventions to those needing it the most, predominantly based on disease control and foreseeable risk of nonadherence. This type of approach seems to be more effective than general untargeted approaches. This study was a randomized clinical trial. Data pooled for this study was gathered from the main health insurer in New Jersey, called Horizon. A total of 6,000 individuals with type 2 diabetes, over the age of 18, on basal insulin therapy were included in this trial. Patients who were insured through Medicaid or Medicare or those who were insured less than 3 months of continuous enrollment, were excluded. The study was conducted from July 7, 2016, through October 5, 2017. Participants were randomly assigned into 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was performed based on availability of 1 or more HbA1c test values available at baseline. Insulin use persistence was considered as the primary outcome. In terms of secondary outcomes, average changes in HbA1c level and health care utilization were evaluated. Outcomes were compared in moderate-intensity and high-intensity arms versus the low-intensity arm.In this study, pharmacists interacting with patients and those patients were not blinded. However, the investigators remained blinded until all data analyses were finalized. The first study arm consisted of participants on low-intensity intervention which was defined as a personalized telephone consultation with a clinical pharmacist and two follow-up calls. All individuals in this arm received the low-intensity intervention. In the second group, 60% of participants who were considered at greater risk of noncompliance, received two calls from their primary care or clinical pharmacist to answer their questions and up to six follow-up calls. This intervention was considered moderate-intensity intervention. Additionally, the moderate-intensity intervention arm was offered to receive a weekly text messaging program which focused on medication-taking behaviors, lifestyle modification, and glycemic control. In the third study arm, 40% of patients with baseline Hb1C of 8% or higher and at high risk of noncompliance, received what was considered high-intensity intervention. This intervention was defined as a maximum of 12 follow-up calls, as well as phone calls to primary care clinicians or pharmacies as often as necessary.The study results show that there was no significant difference for the moderate- or high-intensity arms compared with the low-intensity arm regarding insulin use persistence. A total of 24.7% of those in the low-intensity group, 30.7% in the medium-intensity group, and 34.3% in the high-intensity group completed the telephone consultation with a pharmacist. However, the high-intensity group appeared to experience the greatest improvements in glycemic control (difference from baseline in absolute HbA1c –0.25%) when compared with the low- and moderate-intensity arms (–0.15% for both arms). Furthermore, total cost and office visits were similar in all arms, although the moderate-intensity intervention arm had more hospitalizations (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.41) and emergency department visits (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.24-1.53) in comparison to low-intensity intervention arm. This study concluded that improvement in glycemic control was the goal, even though it was measured as the secondary outcome, and it is considered to a more important outcome in diabetes care.Practice Pearls:A total of 24.7% of those in the low-intensity group, 30.7% in the medium-intensity group, and 34.3% in the high-intensity group completed the telephone consultation with a pharmacist.Baseline persistence was high in all 3 arms.Targeting a different patient population might have increased the effectiveness of the interventions.

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/4zCWbtC0Iy,news
Insulin Is A Major Focus In The Debate Over Rising Prescription Drug Prices,"Lawmakers in the House and Senate are pressing companies to lower prices for insulin which is essential for many people with diabetes. The price is 10 times higher today than it was 20 years ago. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The pressure to lower drug prices now focuses on insulin. Lawmakers in the House and Senate want companies to cut prices for insulin, which is essential for many people with diabetes. The price is 10 times higher today than it was a couple of decades ago. There is one company lowering costs, as we hear from NPR's Alison Kodjak. ALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Express Scripts manages prescription drug insurance for more than 80 million people. It says it's offering a plan so the diabetes patients it covers will pay only $25 a month for their medicine. Dr. Steve Miller is the chief clinical officer for the health insurance company Cigna, which owns Express Scripts. STEVE MILLER: What we're hoping is that we're going to see more diabetics taking their insulin, less complications for those patients and hopefully lower health care costs. KODJAK: He says the company, which covers 1.4 million people who take insulin, hopes the lower prices will mean patients will be more likely to take insulin according to their doctor's orders. Under the plan, even people who haven't met their deductible or who usually pay a percentage of the drug's retail price will not pay more than $25 a month. Express Scripts announced the new plan just a day after members of Congress held a hearing on the high cost of insulin. Gail DeVore, a patient advocate who has been dependent on insulin for 47 years, testified at the House hearing yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GAIL DEVORE: Every day I get emails from people asking, how do I afford insulin? Every day. And every day I have to help them find a way to find insulin. KODJAK: She says she has a good job and good insurance but still has forgone car repairs and doesn't take vacations because she spends so much on her own medication. A recent study by researchers at Yale found that about a quarter of people with diabetes skipped doses or use less than prescribed to save money. Kasia Lipska is a research professor at Yale's medical school. She told the lawmakers that drug companies are using insulin to boost profits, not come up with better drugs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KASIA LIPSKA: I'll just go back to this vial of insulin. This is the same stuff - right? - this is the same insulin that's been around since 1996. Nothing has changed except the price. KODJAK: Express Scripts says the $25 copay plan won't apply to patients who have government-sponsored insurance like Medicare or Medicaid. It'll be available to consumers whose insurance companies opt in, and it covers insulin made by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, two of the biggest insulin makers in the world. Alison Kodjak, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF WHEN THE CLOUDS' ""THE DAWN AND THE EMBRACE"") INSKEEP: We should note both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been NPR financial supporters in the past.

Exercise as 'Precision Medicine' for Insulin Resistance and Its Progression to Type 2 Diabetes: A Research Review,"Abstract Type 2 diabetes and obesity epidemics are in effect in the United States and the two pathologies are linked. In accordance with the growing appreciation that 'exercise is medicine,' it is intuitive to suggest that exercise can play an important role in the prevention and/or treatment of these conditions. However, if exercise is to truly be considered as a viable alternative to conventional healthcare prevention/treatment strategies involving pharmaceuticals, it must be prescribed with similar scrutiny. Indeed, it seems reasonable to posit that the recent initiative calling for 'precision medicine' in the US standard healthcare system should also be applied in the exercise setting. In this narrative review, we consider a number of explanations that have been forwarded regarding the pathological progression to type 2 diabetes both with and without the concurrent influence of overweight/obesity. Our goal is to provide insight regarding exercise strategies that might be useful as 'precision medicine' to prevent/treat this disease. Although the etiology of type 2 diabetes is complex and cause/consequence characteristics of associated dysfunctions have been debated, it is well established that impaired insulin action plays a critical early role. Consequently, an exercise strategy to prevent/treat this disease should be geared toward improving insulin sensitivity both from an acute and chronic standpoint. However, research suggests that a chronic improvement in insulin sensitivity only manifests when weight loss accompanies an exercise intervention. This has resonance because ectopic fat accumulation appears to represent a central component of disease progression regardless of whether obesity is also part of the equation. The cause/consequence characteristics of the relationship between insulin resistance, pathological fat deposition and/or mobilsation, elevated and/or poorly-distributed lipid within myocytes and an impaired capacity to use lipid as fuel remains to be clarified as does the role of muscle mitochondria in the metabolic decline. Until these issues are resolved, a multidimensional exercise strategy (e.g., aerobic exercise at a range of intensities and resistance training for muscular hypertrophy) could provide the best alternative for prevention/treatment.

The fact that some of these individuals can fend off metabolic decline despite being obese while others possess type 2 diabetes and/or insulin resistance without obesity provides evidence that initiation and progression of type 2 diabetes is multi-factorial and complex.

Metabolic flexibility is often quantified as the change in non-protein respiratory exchange ratio between metabolic extremes; for example, the fasting state and the metabolic milieu created by supraphysiological insulin stimulation during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. In their study, van de Weijer et al. confirmed that subjects with type 2 diabetes demonstrate a higher NPRER (less lipid use) during fasting (open bars) and a lower NPRER (less carbohydrate use) during maximal insulin stimulation (closed bars) [].

Top panel: As exercise work rate is increased during incremental exercise, the rate of lipid oxidation also increases to reach its maximum value at a mid-range intensity before decreasing and becoming negligible as the highest achievable work rates are encountered. Bottom Panel: The combination of increasing energy expenditure, increasing carbohydrate contribution and the reduced reliance on lipid (see above) as exercise intensity increases results in a 'crossover' point beyond which lipid is no longer the predominant fuel.

Constant-work-rate exercise at the 'fatmax' would allow for the highest rate of lipid turnover while constant-work-rate exercise at the 'critical power' would result in the greatest sustainable rate of energy use. Even higher intensities can be achieved by employing high-intensity interval training; however, in this case, intermittent periods of rest or low-intensity exercise must be interspersed to allow the exercise bout to be continued.

Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/TWMKW2GJjM,news
"The incredible history of insulin, a lifesaving diabetes drug that was discovered almost a century ago and is now at the center of drug pricing outrage | Business Insider","For the 1.25 million Americans living with Type 1diabetes, insulin is a life-saving drug that helps them process the sugar in their blood. Price increases for insulin have put pressure on people living with diabetes who don't have insurance, or whose insurance plans require them to pay the full price of the medication. Here's the history of how insulin was discovered and how a treatment discovered almost a century ago became a target of public and political outrage in 2019. Visit BusinessInsider.com for more stories. Diabetes, a group of conditions in which the body can't properly regulate blood sugar, affects roughly 30 million people in the US.And for many people living with diabetes – including the 1.25 million people in the US who have Type 1 diabetes – injecting insulin is part of the daily routine.Insulin, a hormone that healthy bodies produce, has been used to treat diabetes for almost a century, though it's gone through some modifications.In the past decade, the list prices of insulin have risen about 300%. This has drawn criticism from patients who have to pay the high cost as well as from politicians, who are going after drugmakers over their prices.Here's the story of how the critical diabetes medicine became what it is today. This article was initially published in 2016 and has been updated. Insulin is an integral part of the human body. It's a hormone that's produced in the pancreas to help regulate our blood sugar levels. For those living with Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas doesn't make any insulin, which can cause blood sugar levels to rise too high.In the 1920s, researchers figured out that the pancreas was an important part of what was making diabetics so sick and got to work figuring out if they could make a treatment. Pictured here is an inflamed pancreas alongside other organs, from a rhesus monkey.Dr. Frederick Banting, a Toronto-based surgeon, along with medical student Charles Best, started by testing out what happens when you remove a dog's pancreas. When they did, the dog developed diabetes. Next, they found that if you inject insulin back into the dog, it went back to normal.Banting and Best then began injecting insulin from animal pancreases into people to treat their diabetes. In 1922, a person with diabetes was given the first insulin injection. The team went on to win the Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin in 1923, and later sold the patent for $US3 to the University of Toronto. Source: NobelPrize.org, Clinical Chemistry For a long time, these animal insulins were used to treat people with diabetes. In the 1970s, scientists found that they could use recombinant DNA to manufacture real human insulin.These human insulins (also known as regular insulin) are still in use, although starting in the 1990s, a third wave of insulin came on the scene. These analogue insulins built on the human insulins, but had slight variations that make them act more like the insulin naturally produced and regulated by the body.A 2011 World Health Organisation review didn't find that analogue insulins had any advantage over human insulins. The newer insulins also come at about twice the price as human insulins, which the WHO said was not worth it. Source: World Health OrganisationMost people who need insulin either inject it with a syringe, a pen, or an insulin pump (pictured here) that can deliver insulin as needed throughout the day.Since the first analogue insulin was approved (Humalog), the list price of a vial has steadily increased in step with its competitor, Novolog. In the last decade, the price has gone up 300%. A vial of insulin now costs close to $US300.The price of insulin continues to be a concern for those living with diabetes along with their families. With the rise in high deductible plans, some are paying as much as a mortgage payment for a month's supply of the medication. Source: Business InsiderResearch into finding newer insulins, or better ways to deliver insulin, continues. In 2016, the FDA approved the first ""artificial pancreas,"" a device that can both monitor glucose levels and deliver insulin. Sources: Business Insider, PhRMAIn December 2016, the FDA approved Basaglar, which came at a slight discount to some of the other long-acting insulins on the market. Source: Business InsiderThe cost of insulin has attracted the attention of lawmakers, who at the state level have initiated new laws that require transparency around insulin prices. Source: Business InsiderFor instance, Andrew, a 22-year-old college student with Type 1 diabetes saw the price he paid for insulin over the course of a year jump 150% for the same amount of medication. No one could explain why that happened. Source: Business InsiderIn response to the criticism, drugmaker Eli Lilly in March debuted an ""authorised generic"" version of its short-acting insulin Humalog, cutting the price by half to $US137. But many noted that the price was still unaffordable. Source: Business InsiderOther insulin makers have taken steps to increase their patient assistance programs. Sanofi in April updated its program so patients with diabetes can buy up to 10 boxes of insulin for $US99 a box. Some have said they'd cap future list price increases. Source: Business Insider,Business InsiderIn 2019, insulin-makers Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk testified at a Congressional hearing. ""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois told the executives. ""Your days are numbered."" Source: Business Insider Business Insider Emails &amp; Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

Mark Riddell took tests in college admissions scam; IMG suspends him,"CLOSE The college admissions scam involving Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman shows how some rich families use a ""side door"" to game an already unfair education system. Just the FAQs, USA TODAYTo pull off the largest college admissions bribery scheme in U.S history, prosecutors say a middleman working for rich and powerful parents funneled money to a private school counselor in Florida to secretly take their children's ACT and SAT exams. Mark Riddell of Palmetto, Florida, is accused of being the test-taker in the explosive cheating scandal.Riddell, 36, is a 2004 graduate of Harvard University where he starred in tennis. He also briefly played pro tennis.And since 2006, he's worked as director of college entrance exam preparation at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, a prestigious private boarding school for high school student-athletes that has produced elite college players and professional athletes. IMG Academy suspended Riddell following his indictment Tuesday. Start the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inboxProsecutors say that sometimes Riddell himself took the tests for the students and in other instances he corrected their answers after their test was turned in. They say it went on from 2011 to February. ""He was just a really smart guy,"" said Andrew Lelling, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, which is leading the prosecution in the sweeping case. ""He did not have inside information about the correct answers. He was just smart enough to get a near-perfect score on demand or to calibrate the score.""Riddell apologizes for 'needless actions'Riddell has been charged with two counts of conspiracy involving both mail fraud and money laundering for his critical role in the cheating portion of the elaborate conspiracy that has led to criminal charges against 50 people including 33 affluent parents. The scheme also involved bribes to college coaches, prosecutors say. He is set to appear in federal court in Boston on April 12 for a waiver of indictment and plea to Information hearing. In a statement provided by his attorney Wednesday, Riddell apologized for what he called his ""needless actions,"" saying that he understands how they ""contributed to a loss of trust in the college admissions process."" He said he accepts ""full responsibility for what I have done.""More: Felicity Huffman released on bail after allegedly bribing to get kid into college as part of sweeping admissions scandalBut he added that he wants to clarify that he ""absolutely, unequivocally never bribed anyone,"" rejecting an assertion that he claims has has risen in media coverage. The Justice Department has not accused him of bribery, but rather accepting the payments.""I will always regret the choices I made, but I also believe that the morethan one thousand students I legitimately counseled, inspired, and helpedreach their goals in my career will paint a more complete picture of theperson I truly am,"" Riddell said. William ""Rick"" Singer leaves Boston Federal Court after being charged with racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and obstruction of justice on March 12, 2019 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo: Scott Eisen, Getty Images)Prosecutors say Riddell would typically get paid $10,000 per test, paid by William ""Rick"" Singer of Newport Beach, California, the suspected ringleader of the international scheme. Singer operated a sham counseling nonprofit and received more than $25 million in bribe payments since 2011 from parents looking to get their under-qualified students into elite colleges and universities, according to federal charging documents. More: Everything you need to know about the nation's largest-ever college cheating scandal involving Felicity Huffman and Lori LoughlinRiddell's cheating was enabled by two test administrators, Niki Williams in Houston, and Igor Dvorskiy in Los Angeles, who received bribe money from Singer as well, according to prosecutors. They would then return the falsified tests to the ACT and SAT. Lelling said that Singer and parents would settle on an appropriate test score before the ACT or SAT was administered so that it would not increase by such a large amount that it would raise suspicion if the student had taken the test before. Riddell would then try to hit that number. AutoplayShow ThumbnailsShow CaptionsLast SlideNext Slide""He was just good enough to do it,"" Lelling said.In one instance described in the charging document, Riddell called Singer after taking an ACT exam from a Houston hotel room on July 14 of last year. He predicted that he would score a 35 out of 36.He ended up scoring just that – a 35. High school sports academy launches own investigation IMG Academy, Riddell's employer for more than a dozen years, has a boarding school for student-athletes as well as training programs in a wide-range of sports. The academy, which is not implicated in the federal case, issued a brief statement Tuesday night on Twitter announcing Riddell's suspension. It came as the academy also appeared to remove a biographical page of Riddell from its web site. ""Today we were made aware of the charges against Mark Riddell. Riddell has been suspended indefinitely as we investigate this matter,"" IMG's statement reads.Some of the cream of the crop in sports have attended IMG Academy, according to the school's web site. Their athletes have gone on to play in the NFL, NBA, MLB, professional tennis and golf, accounting for 133 professional all-star appearances, three Heisman Trophy winners, 63 most valuable player awards, 14 collegiate national titles, 29 world championship titles, and 32 Olympic medals. In the current 2019 graduating class, IMG has seven football players who are ranked in the 247Sports's top 300 recruiting prospects list. Three are ranked in the top 10. How the cheating transactions unfolded, prosecutors sayParents involved in the cheating scheme would make donations to Singer's organization. To facilitate the cheating, prosecutors say Singer often counseled parents to seek extended time on the children's SAT or ACT exams by having their children pretend to have learning disabilities. Singer would pay $10,000 to Dvorskiy, who administered ACT exams at a Los Angeles private high school, and would pay $5,000 to Williams, who oversaw testing at a Houston public school. More: 'So that's what he was up to': Rick Singer, architect of scam, peddled a 'side door' to college admissionsA court filing outlining charges against Riddell describes an agreement for a $50,000 payment that one defendant, identified as ""Parent 1,"" made to Singer in exchange for Riddell taking the ACT in place of their son. Singer provided Riddell with a sample of the son's handwriting on July 13, the document says, so that he could imitate it. Riddell flew from Tampa, Florida to Houston later that same day. Williams, the test administrator, is accused of providing the test on July 14 to Riddell, who then completed the exam in his hotel. The next day, Singer mailed a $10,000 check to Riddell, prosecutors say, and a $5,000 check to Williams, who sent the exam to the ACT for scoring. Days later, ""Parent 1"" wired $35,000 to Singer's group as a partial payment toward the $50,000 fee.In addition to the conspiracy charges, federal prosecutors are also seeking to recover $447,000 in forfeitures from Riddell.

UW researcher's experiment being launched to space station,"WATERLOO — Astronauts on the International Space Station will help out with a University of Waterloo kinesiology professor's research into heart health. The space station crew members will wear a special shirt equipped with sensors to continuously monitor heart rate, breathing and activity, and test their blood sugar, said UW's Richard Hughson. The Canadian research will investigate astronauts' cardiovascular health and the connection between physical activity and insulin resistance — helpful information for both people in space and on Earth. ""We know that insulin resistance develops in people who are inactive,"" said Hughson, the Schlegel research chair in vascular aging and brain health at UW. ""On Earth, type 2 diabetes is becoming epidemic."" Hughson was part of a NASA technical briefing on Wednesday, ahead of next week's scheduled launch of a resupply ship that will carry scientific research and hardware to the space station including supplies for oral glucose-tolerance tests and the Montreal-made biomonitoring shirt. ""The astronaut will wear this device for 72 hours,"" Hughson said of this latest experiment in a series. The conference call included a sampling of the scientific investigations and technology headed to the space laboratory, where the low-Earth orbit provides a unique environment with microgravity and extreme conditions. Hughson explained that an astronaut's carotid arteries stiffen to the equivalent of what normally happens in 10 to 20 years of aging while in space for six months. ""We also discovered that they were developing insulin resistance,"" Hughson said. The changes in the short term are likely not a big deal because people aren't staying in space now for more than a few months, he said. ""In the long term, it could be quite important."" Poor glucose tolerance means the glucose level stays high in a person's blood after eating, where it can bind to protein in the blood vessels and cause increased stiffness. Over time, that can lead to heart disease. ""Sedentary behaviour is really one of the major underlying causes of type 2 diabetes and all the health consequences that arise from that,"" Hughson said. The lessons learned in space can give people on Earth an incentive to be active. ""If you can send a really fit, healthy astronaut into space and he or she starts developing insulin resistance because of the physical inactivity of space flight, it really, I hope, drives home the message to all of us on Earth how important it is to have regular periods of physical activity throughout the whole day."" jweidner@therecord.com Twitter: @WeidnerRecord jweidner@therecord.com Twitter: @WeidnerRecord",https://t.co/fZJEp8Ubty,news
"Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software Defined Radios","Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software DefinedÂ RadiosReverse Engineering an Insulin Pump for DIY Closed Loop TherapyRoughly 3 years ago, I heard about a website offering a bounty for something that was very close to my heart: reverse engineering communications to an insulin pump. My daughter was already using a system that I had helped to create called Loop, with a Medtronic pump that I had reverse engineered the RF comms forÂ¹. But the Medtronic pump required her to disconnect during her gymnastics for hours at a time. The tubeless design of this Omnipod pump sounded great, and I had all the tools to start working on the problem.The Omnipod system consists of a small disposable pump called a pod, and a controlling unit called a PDM.Because the PDM communicates with the pod using radio and the pod has no built in interface, it means the pod is entirely controllable over the radio. There was the potential to create a full integration with Loop using just a RileyLink, or a modified version of it.James Wedding had put up the bounty, and it attracted a lot of attention, and ultimately the right people who would be needed to make progress.Software DefinedÂ RadioSDRs are awesome tools; they make the hidden world of radio visible. There are all kinds of messages zipping by all the time, and these tools let you poke around, see the messages, and with some work, start decoding the little blips you see there. If you're looking for messages from a specific device, you need to know what general area to start looking in. That's where the FCC public filings come in handy.The FCC filing for the PDM, RBV-019, shows that the device transmits in the 433MHz range. Configuring the SDR software to listen in the 433MHz range while issuing a status from the PDM shows comms like this:As I eventually learned, those two bright lines are indicative of a certain type of modulation called frequency shift keying, or FSK. This means that the frequency of the signal varies with the information being transmitted. A 1 bit is sent as a higher frequency (the top line) and a 0 bit is sent with a slightly lower frequency (the bottom line). And using the tool inspectrum we can have it analyze the data to more clearly show the 1's and 0's. Here's a very zoomed in view of that first message above:I ended up writing a python script to extract these bits so we could look at them as a whole packet.It turns out this repeating pattern was part of the preamble. To conserve energy, receivers often have a pattern of sleeping, and waking up periodically to check for a signal. The transmitter sends a preamble long enough to catch the receiver during one of the short listening periods. When the receiver hears the preamble, it stays awake until the real data shows up.There was one more layer we had to get through before we were looking at actual packet data. You can't send your data over the radio exactly as the original bits, because the receiver uses the transitions to synchronize in time when to expect the next bit. If you have a long set of 1's or 0's, the receiver could get out of sync. So radio communications usually use an encoding to make sure there are enough transitions. The Omnipod communications use an encoding called Manchester encoding. Each bit is encoded by two bits. A 1 bit is encoded as 10, and a 0 bit is encoded as 01.This all took a lot of hashing out and there were a lot of theories shared in the openomni slack, as we tried to make getting the raw bits repeatable. Mark Brighton, Dan Caron, and @larsonlr, had been having some success with using RFCat and a TI Stick to capture packets. Evariste Courjaud would eventually write a tool called rtlomni used an rtl-sdr stick to listen for packets and decode them that would prove to be very convenient and more reliable than the TI-Stick based methods.Decoding PacketsOnce we had the actual bits of the packet, we started to look into packet structure. Based on what bits were changing between different pods, and different commands, we pieced together an understanding that looked like this.CRC8Radio is a far from perfect transmission medium. There are many different sources of interference that can make the receiver hear a 1 when a 0 was sent, and vice versa. It's important to know when this has happened, so most protocols use a checksum of sorts, often something called a CRC. The receiver computes the CRC as it receives the data, and the last byte of the packet includes the CRC as the transmitter computed it. If they don't match, the receiver throws the packet away and waits for a retransmission.The Omnipod protocol used a standard 8-bit CRC, so when we found this, we thought we were really close to having the messages figured out. Little did we know…Messages, CRC16Some messages are too big to fit into a single packet, so they are sent as multiple packets. We started to piece together the format of messages, and noticed another set of bits at the end of each message that looked like a 16-bit crc. But it was weird; 5 of the 16 bits were never set. We tried many different techniques to figure out how this was being set, but nothing worked.This was the first big blocker; we could proceed to work out what the other bits in the messages were, but it would be little help to understand what was being sent, but not be able to generate new packets ourselves, and so progress slowed down.Months passed with little progress, and finally in winter of 2016 a member of the group with the handle @lorelai posted that she had sucessfully dumped the firmware from the larger ARM-based chip on the PDM, and started the tedious process of disassembly: taking cpu instructions and turning them into human understandable code with semantic variable and function names. She did an amazing job figuring out what various methods were involved in sending data over the radio.I was looking at one of the unnamed routines, and noticed it looked like a standard implementation of a table based CRC calculation. And the table had the values for a standard 16 bit CRC. I wrote my own implementation using the table, and it checked out like a normal CRC. Then I looked closely at how the function was written. A normal CRC implementation looks like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &lt;&lt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Theirs looked like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Spot the difference? What should've been a bitwise left shift operator had somehow been coded as a right shift. This is a bug; there is no reason to cripple your own CRC algorithm, as it makes it less likely to catch corrupted messages.We were up and running again! We started working on decoding messages, recording sessions from the PDM for delivering boluses, temp basals, suspends, etc…NonceAll of the insulin delivery commands had a 4-byte chunk of data near the beginning of the message that looked like it might be some form of cryptography. Again, we tried many different ways of interpreting it, and analyzing it in the context of the messages it was sent in, but it wasn't a crc (we'd see the same 4 bytes on occasion even when the message data was different). And sometimes we'd see the pattern repeat. It looked maybe this was a bit of the protocol designed to prevent replay of data. Other protocols had features like this, called a nonce.One possible route we had considered was to record a database of messages to replay for given commands. Even if the address of each pod was different, now that we knew how to generate the message crc, we could take a copy of the command we had seen before, put a new address on the message, and recompute the crc. Except this nonce was preventing us from using that strategy. For the next insulin delivery command, no matter what command was sent, the pod would only accept the next nonce in the sequence, and we didn't know how to generate the next nonce.But hey! We have the decompiled PDM firmware now, we can just look there! So we pored over the PDM firmware, and tracked down the message generation in the code, and found where those four bytes should be. But instead of a method computing some cryptographic Nonce, we just found the four characters ""INS.. WTF?!?! Ok, somehow this area of the message must be being updated later in the pipeline.There was another chip on the PDM, closer to the radio. It was the same chip that was used in the Pods, a chip with an identifier of SC9S08ER48, something that wasn't documented online, and was likely produced custom for Insulet. Maybe we could get the firmware off of that chip. Unfortunately, that chip was locked, which prevented dumping of firmware.Again, progress slowed… This felt like a real dead end. We had thrown all our smarts at this nonce, and didn't have any good leads on the math that was behind it. And the ER48 that (possibly) held the secrets was locked and it was hard to find any public details that might help us crack it.X-Ray imagesIn trying to understand more about the ER48, some members of the slack community offered to try to get Xray images, which was really cool, but unfortunately didn't open up any new avenues.Overview XrayDetail XrayDecapping andÂ ImagingDan Caron decided to reach out to a researcher, Dr. Sergei Skorobogatov, at the University of Cambridge in the UK that he had read about who had experience in extracting code from locked chips, and convinced him to take a look at our problem. Dr. Skorobogatov had led research in using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) for chip reverse engineering and suggested it might be possible, but would be expensive, needing access to expensive equipment, and not guaranteed. Joe Moran, who had recently started using Loop after we met at the Fall 2016 Nightscout Hackathon dove in to helping out with this project, and arranged with a bay area company, Nanolab Technologies, to perform the decapping and imaging of the chips, and also graciously funded Nanolab and Dr Skorobogatov's work (and also his personal boxes of pods).Dr. Skorobogatov had Nanolab perform a variety of imaging techniques to ascertain if the protection could be defeated with known non-invasive or semi-invasive methods. This resulted in a lot of images, some of them very beautiful. These are optical microscope pictures of the silicon die.Optical microscope dieÂ overviewOptical microscope dieÂ overviewThere were also images taken of specific areas of the die using scanning electron microscopy. Attempts were made with different voltages, different surface preparations, and different equipment.SEM Image of flash memory cells. Not resolving data.Unfortunately, none of these produced images capable of resolving the actual contents of the flash.Dr. Skorobogatov had one last resort method that was only to be used if these other techniques failed. It was a proprietary method that would have to be given the blessing to be used by the University. Dr. Skorobogatov did an initial test and confirmed that it was capable of resolving the data on this chip. But before we could proceed an NDA had to be agreed upon and so negotiations about who was to be the recipient of the extracted firmware were undertaken.The Nightscout foundation would ultimately be the party signing the NDA and would take the responsibility to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the methods and results of the extraction.The result of this arrangement and work was an incredible paper written by Dr Sergei Skorobogatov, and the raw firmware data. The initial extraction of the firmware had a significant number of errors, but was enough to get started on. Joe asked at the spring Nightscout Foundation Hack if anyone would be up for digging into the disassembly. Nobody raised their hands. Turning the cpu instructions into something understandable is painstaking work, and there are very few people who know how to do it. I tried digging into it, using cpu instruction documentation, but made very little progress, and grew frustrated. Others optimistically asked for request to the firmware with big expectations of fast progress, and then realized the scope and challenge of the task and quietly dropped off.Example disassembly of SC908 instructionsIt turns out Joe also has an extensive background working at the assembly level, and started taking on the onerous task himself. In July, Dr. Skorobogatov had completed a second extraction with much fewer errors. Over the summer Joe Moran worked tirelessly on mapping out the huge amount of cpu instructions, and slowly fitting them together into a larger picture of pod pseudocode.Eventually, Ken Shirriff, an expert in hardware reverse engineering, would join the effort and sped up the process considerably. Together, Joe and Ken eventually mapped out enough code to find the function responsible for coding the nonce September of 2017.RileyLink andÂ LoopWe had been updating the openomni python scripts with our understanding of the comms, but now it was time to start focusing on RileyLink + iOS, so I started work on OmniKit, and firmware updates for the RileyLink. I believed we had the fundamentals of the protocol worked out, and the rest was just details. Again, completely underestimating how much more was ahead of us.I had to write new firmware that would handle the pod modulation and encoding. I also had to rewrite the way the two chips on the RL talked to each other to handle 0's, as 0 was a special end of packet marker for Medtronic. Much in Loop needed to be reworked to support multiple Pumps, and new interfaces made to support pairing, deactivating, and handling faults. Thankfully Nate Racklyeft had set a solid foundation in Loop for this to happen.Meanwhile, work on understanding the format of the commands continued and was documented thoroughly on the openomni wiki, which is the most comprehensive documentation on the pod protocol published publicly. Joe, Evariste, and Eelke Jager really did a massive amount of work decoding messages, and updating the pages over time. Various members of the slack channel have contributed captures of PDM to Pod communications to aid decoding efforts.The decoding was fun work, with lots of small wins as each component of each command is deciphered, and I really enjoyed working on this part, and adding code to Loop to implement. In April of 2018 I shared on slack that I had ""paired via iPhone + RL, primed, cannula insertion, basal schedule programmed, and then bolused 5U.The 2.0 RL firmware was finished in July of 2018, and new shipments started including it. It was hoped that these boards would be able to be used with Loop and Omnipod, but the existing 915 MHz antenna would prove to be too poor to do 433 MHz comms effectively.Decoding and implementation was progressed well over the summer, and the Loop experience was coming together. Joe did an amazing thing in providing funding for me to quit my day job, and focus more on this project, and to eventually join the wonderful Tidepool team. There were of course more events happening outside of the omnipod RE story in the DIY and regulator spaces that I won't cover, but it was a very interesting summer!ScreamersAs more functionality came online in the driver, I started hooking it up into Loop, including the ability to automatically adjust delivery by temp basals. At this point it was fairly common to get a screaming pod, which meant some of the pod's internal checking had detected a situation where it decided there was a problem and it should not continue to deliver insulin.But it seemed like a workable problem, as we continued to find small discrepancies in what Loop was sending versus what the PDM would send if the command was delivered manually, and I assumed if we fixed all of those that the screaming would stop.Looping!On October 3, 2018, Joe put a Loop controlled pod on himself and became the first Loop Omnipod user, but didn't tell me immediately as he knew I'd be worrying. When he did tell me, I still worried. We had seen the pod work, and understood the functionality, and the basic algorithm of Loop had been vetted for a long time, but still…A month later, at the November 2018 Nightscout Hackathon, a few more adventurous souls opted try it out for themselves as well, and became part of a small private testing group that would grow to over 30 people before the branch was made public.Unfortunately, we still had screamers often happening before the full 3 days of use were finished, and we had meticulously compared Loop's commands to PDM reference versions. Eelke was particularly helpful with this process, creating a script that could check commands against their reference versions automatically. I started to get worried that the increased demands on the battery for doing communication every five minutes had pushed the pod over the edge of what was sustainable.Pod voltage taps, drilled through back plastic, super-glued inÂ place.So I started measuring pod voltage with an arduino, recording the data and storing it a local database for visualization. Comparing PDM and Loop.Long time scale view of podÂ voltage.Unfortunately, this proved to be a dead end as well; using a PDM and bolusing large amounts, I could drive the pod to lower voltages than even Loop would do over the life of a looping pod, and wasn't able to make the pod scream. It seemed like voltage wasn't the issue, so there must be something else.RileyLinks with 955 MHz (left) and coil 433 MHz (right)Â antennasAt one point I noticed that if a message exchange with the pod failed, the pod would sometimes be left in a state of trying to complete the exchange by re-sending packets over and over and over. Testers logs were also showing lots of failures, and so I started experimenting with antennas. Both of these problems should be improved with better comms. I had planned on trying different antennas and had ordered from random places on the internet, but hadn't had time to try them until it became a priority.I had some flexible 433 MHz antennas that could be taped on the inside of the RL case. These would often have great performance in some scenarios, but not in others; it was too unreliable. When I got to the coil based one, it had good performance very consistently, and at very surprising ranges. Time for a new RileyLink case.With the new antenna, and some optimizations to do fewer message exchanges while still allowing adjustments every 5 minutes, the frequency of screamers went down to a very low rate. Likely comparable to using a pod normally with a PDM. In the most recent 7,500 hours of live testing, 94% of pods completed without faults.Testing and DocumentationThe testing group grew slowly, which was a great way to continually get new eyes on the system and see what parts were confusing. These testers put up with a lot of screaming pods, and contributed in very big ways to making Loop with Omnipod work better. They did this primarily by sharing issue reports from each of their pods, whether successful or not.The issue reports have a message log in them that could be analyzed by the tool that Eelke built, giving us insight into whether we had any misformatted commands and also let us gather statistics around certain parts of Loop's interaction with the pods.Marion Barker joined the testing group and added dedicated reporting, and additional statistics to the progress of testing, and we were able to use her stats of successful pods vs failures to have a high level view of progress.Eventually Katie DiSimone joined the testing group, and started a large restructuring of loopdocs.org to provide documentation for using Loop with multiple devices. The anticipation around a version of Loop that worked with Omnipod was incredibly high, and without good documentation, it was certain that we'd be flooded with the same questions over and over.New Features ForÂ LoopOmnipod integration required rethinking of some interface elements, and adding new controls. The pod doesn't report battery, and there is little a user can do about a low battery if one were to somehow happen, so displaying a battery level widget didn't make sense. Also, without a UI on the pump, the user needs to be able to cancel a bolus quickly. The reservoir icon was a picture of a Medtronic reservoir, so we wanted to rethink that. Thank you to Paul Forgione for designing the pod logo that now shows reservoir level.ThanksThank you to all the people who help make this long road come to a place where we can share this with others, and realize the goal that we set out to do a long time ago. I know I didn't cover everyone, and everything that happened. That would be impossible in a single post, and for me, since I only have my experience through this. It's hard to imagine the total hours put into this. If you could add them all up, I'm sure it would be shocking. Not to mention the work that has gone into making the Omnipod itself, which I imagine dwarfs this effort. So thank you *all*. Also, many of those hours would otherwise have been spent with families. I really appreciate my wife and kids being understanding with the time I've spent on this, and want to thank them too.SidenotesI have to mention Joakim Ornstedt, as one of the contributors to openomni decoding, and also the creator of what is probably actually the first looping integration with omnipod. He built a device that used optical character recognition (OCR) on the PDM to get data from the PDM, and wired in digital button presses to the PDM through another microcontroller. It's a hard to scale approach, but very clever, and bypasses a lot of the issues we had to deal with for an RE based solution. I really admired him for pulling this off, and getting looping in a tiny fraction of the time it took to make it work with Loop.",https://t.co/N7GUnKuBxb,news
"Frederick Banting, Charles Best, James Collip, and John Macleod","In the early 1920s Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin under the directorship of John Macleod at the University of Toronto. With the help of James Collip insulin was purified, making it available for the successful treatment of diabetes. Banting and Macleod earned a Nobel Prize for their work in 1923.At the turn of the 20th century a strict low-calorie, no-carbohydrate diet was the only effective treatment for diabetes. But this method, with food intake sometimes as low as 500 calories per day, had its consequences, as slow starvation, like diabetes, drained patients of their strength and energy, leaving them semi-invalids. The diet treatment also required an inordinate amount of willpower on the part of the patient, very few of whom were able to maintain low-calorie diets over the long term. In 1921 researchers at the University of Toronto began a series of experiments that would ultimately lead to the isolation and commercial production of insulin—a pancreatic hormone essential for metabolizing carbohydrates—and the successful treatment of diabetes.Setting the Stage for the Discovery of InsulinThe connection between pancreatic secretions and diabetes was first shown in 1889 by two German physiologists at the University of Strasbourg, Oskar Minkowski and Joseph von Mering. While investigating the effect of pancreatic secretions on the metabolism of fat, they performed a complete pancreatectomy on a laboratory dog, only to discover that the animal developed a disease indistinguishable from diabetes. Twenty years earlier a German medical student, Paul Langerhans, had discovered two systems of cells in the pancreas: the acini, which he knew produced the pancreatic digestive secretions, and another system whose function was unknown to him. These cells looked to Langerhans like tiny clusters of cells, or islands, floating among the acini. In 1901 Eugene Opie, an American pathologist at Johns Hopkins University, made the association between the degeneration of these cells, which had been named the ""islets of Langerhans,"" and the onset of diabetes. Through the experimental efforts of these and many other researchers, the stage was set for the discovery of insulin—the hormonal antidiabetic secretion of the islets of Langerhans—in the first decades of the 20th century.Frederick BantingIn 1920 Frederick Grant Banting (1891–1941) was a surgeon in a floundering practice in London, Ontario, Canada. The youngest son of Methodist farmers from Alliston, Ontario, Banting almost entered the Methodist ministry but decided at the last moment that his calling lay in medicine. World War I shortened his five-year medical course at the University of Toronto: his class did its entire fifth year during the summer of 1916 and, upon receiving their hasty degrees, went off to war. Banting served as a battalion medical officer in the Canadian Army Medical Corps; he returned to Toronto in 1919 after having been wounded in the arm by shrapnel. He trained as a surgeon at the Hospital of Sick Children in Toronto, then decided to open a small practice as a surgeon in London, Ontario. Unfortunately, his earnings from his practice were meager, forcing him to take a position as a demonstrator in the local medical school. It was in this capacity that Banting was preparing a lecture about the function of the pancreas on October 30, 1920. He stopped at the medical school library, where he picked up the latest issue of Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics, and read an article titled ""The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, with Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.""Banting Approaches John MacleodWhile thinking about pancreatic secretions after reading the article, Banting jotted down an idea for a preliminary experiment to further investigate the relationship between pancreatic secretions and diabetes. On November 7, following the advice of a colleague, Banting brought his idea to the attention of John James Rickard Macleod (1876–1935), a Scottish physiologist and expert in carbohydrate metabolism at his alma mater, the University of Toronto.Macleod, the son of a minister, received his medical training at the University of Aberdeen and his biochemical training at the University of Leipzig. In 1903 Macleod emigrated to the United States to take a position as professor of physiology at Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio. After 15 years at Western, Macleod accepted a professorship at the University of Toronto, where he conducted research on respiration.Earlier in his career Macleod had published a series of papers on glycosuria, or the presence of sugar in the urine (a common indication of diabetes). As a scientist familiar with the literature on the subject, he was unimpressed with Banting's range of knowledge about diabetes and the pancreas and skeptical about the soundness of Banting's idea. However, Macleod decided to give him lab space, an assistant, and some laboratory dogs for two months at the end of the academic year.Experiments BeginBanting and his assistant, Charles Herbert Best (1899–1978), began their experiments in May 1921. Best, the American son of Canadian parents, had just finished his bachelor's degree in physiology and biochemistry at the University of Toronto and had been hired as a research assistant to Macleod, his former teacher. Macleod assigned him to Banting, and the 29-year-old surgeon and the 22-year-old assistant began their work together.A combination of timing and good luck enabled the Toronto researchers to be the first to announce the discovery of insulin. Scientists in Germany and Hungary had come very close to finding pure insulin, but lack of funding and the devastation of World War I halted their progress. Following in the footsteps of earlier researchers, Banting and Best began to study diabetes through an experimental combination of duct ligation, which involved tying off the pancreatic duct to the small intestine, and pancreatectomies, or the complete surgical removal of the pancreas. Duct ligation served to atrophy the acini cells that produced the digestive secretions, leaving behind only the cells of the islets of Langerhans. Duct-ligated dogs, it was discovered, did not develop diabetes. Pancreatectomy was the method of inducing diabetes: when all pancreatic tissue was removed, the experimental dogs immediately showed signs of glycosuria.Banting's idea of October 30 involved ligation of the pancreatic ducts of a dog and the extraction and isolation of whatever secretions were produced after the atrophy of the acini cells. He and Best began this experiment, only to find that it was difficult to keep duct-ligated, depancreatized dogs alive long enough to carry out any tests. After a summer of many setbacks and failures, however, the team reported in the fall that they were keeping a severely diabetic dog alive with injections of an extract made from duct-ligated pancreas and prepared, following Macleod's instructions, in saline. Amazingly, this extract dramatically lowered the blood sugar levels of diabetic experimental dogs.Findings Are Presented and Tensions BeginOn December 30, 1921, Macleod, Banting, and Best presented their findings at the conference of the American Physiological Society, at Yale University. Banting, out of nervousness and inexperience, did a poor job delivering the paper, and the audience was highly critical of the findings presented. Macleod, as the chair of the session, joined the discussion in an attempt to rescue Banting from the scathing commentary. After this fiasco Banting became convinced that Macleod had stepped in to steal the credit from him and Best, and relations between the two began to deteriorate.Purifying Insulin and the First Human TestsAt the end of 1921 Macleod invited James Bertram Collip (1892–1965), a biochemist in the department of physiology at the University of Toronto, to help Banting and Best with purifying their extract. Collip, another University of Toronto graduate, was on sabbatical from the University of Alberta and, supported by a fellowship, had returned to his alma mater. As the experimental pace quickened, Banting and Best needed large amounts of their extract, and Collip set to work purifying the extract for clinical testing in humans.The first clinical tests on a human patient were conducted on a severely diabetic 14-year-old boy. Although the injections of the extract failed to have resoundingly beneficial effects, the Toronto team continued to experiment. A short while later Collip made a breakthrough in purifying the extract, using alcohol in slightly over 90 percent concentration to precipitate out the active ingredient (insulin). At the same time, though, personal tension was mounting among the four scientists, as Banting became increasingly bitter toward Macleod and pitted himself and Best against Collip in the race to purify the extract. At the end of January, Collip came to Banting and Best's lab and informed the two that although he had discovered a method to produce pure extract, he would share it only with Macleod. It was only Best's quick restraint that stopped Banting from attacking Collip. Fortunately for the future of insulin an uneasy agreement made a few days later allowed them to continue to work together. On May 3, 1922, Macleod, representing the group, announced to the international medical community at a meeting of the Association of American Physicians that they had discovered ""insulin""—the antidiabetic agent.Nobel PrizeBanting and Macleod received the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of insulin. That the Nobel committee chose only Banting and Macleod for the award caused more animosity. Banting, outraged that Macleod was chosen to share the prize with him, immediately announced that he would split his winnings with Best. Macleod, perhaps in reaction to Banting's gesture, announced that he, too, would be splitting his award, with Collip. By the end of 1923 insulin had been in commercial production for a year at the Eli Lilly and Company laboratories in Indianapolis. Diabetic patients who received insulin shots recovered from comas, resumed eating carbohydrates (in moderation), and realized they had been given a new lease on life.The information contained in this biography was last updated on December 1, 2017.SaveSave",https://t.co/NJPRwOoOQe,news
'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/59lwvi8vSE,news
Health insurer Cigna caps out-of-pocket expenses at $25 for 30-day supply of insulin,"Health insurer Cigna is launching a program that will cap out-of-pocket expenses at $25 for a 30-day supply of insulin, the company said.(CNN) — Health insurer Cigna is launching a program that will cap out-of-pocket expenses at $25 for a 30-day supply of insulin, the company said Wednesday. Last year, patients paid an average of $41.50 a month out of pocket, including deductibles, copays or coinsurance, for the lifesaving diabetes drug, the company said.The Patient Assurance Program will be available to members of participating non-government-funded pharmacy plans managed by Express Scripts, including Cigna and other plans. Cigna acquired Express Scripts, the largest US pharmacy benefit management company, in December.""In most cases, people who use insulin will see lower out-of-pocket costs without any increased cost to the plan,"" the company said.The move follows the US Food and Drug Administration's announcement Tuesday that it intends to bring competition to the insulin market as a way to lower prices. Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the FDA would change how insulin is regulated in order to enable products that are biosimilar to (or interchangeable with) insulin to come to market.Biologics are typically isolated from a natural source and may be produced through biotechnology and other cutting-edge technologies, Gottlieb explained: ""Once an interchangeable insulin product is approved and available on the market, it can then be substituted for the reference product at the pharmacy, potentially leading to increased access and lower costs for patients.""People with diabetes are prescribed insulin because their bodies either do not produce it (as with Type 1 diabetes) or do not use it properly (as with Type 2 diabetes). There are more than 20 types of insulin sold in the United States, according to the American Diabetes Association.About 31% of American adults with diabetes reported taking insulin in 2011, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while the diabetes association reported that 23.1 million Americans had been diagnosed with diabetes in 2015.A report from the Health Care Cost Institute, an independent research group funded by four health insurance companies, found that individuals with Type 1 diabetes spent, on average, $5,705 per person on insulin in 2016, an increase of $2,841 since 2012. ""The price of all types of insulin and insulin products increased, with point-of-sale prices roughly doubling on average between 2012 and 2016,"" said the institute, which holds data on over 50 million commercially insured individuals per year.Between 2010 and 2015, the cost of Humulin R U-500, an Eli Lilly product, experienced the largest price increase (380%), jumping from $15 to $72, according to Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit news service focused on health-care policy.Eli Lilly did not respond to requests for comment on Cigna's announcement but said last month that it had created insulin lispro, a generic version of a faster-acting and more expensive product called Humalog U-100, ""to provide a more affordable option for certain Americans in high-deductible health insurance plans, the uninsured and seniors that hit the coverage gap in their Medicare Part D plans.""The generic would sell for half the price of Humalog U-100, which costs $135 per month for patients who take an average amount, according to the company.Insulin pricing in the United States is driven by a supply chain consisting of manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and pharmacies, according to the American Diabetes Association: ""In much of Europe, insulin costs about a sixth of what it does in the United States.""At a US House of Representatives subcommittee hearing on insulin pricing Tuesday, Aaron Kowalski, chief mission officer of JDRF, a nonprofit diabetes research funding organization, called for the elimination of rebates — which make up more than 70% of the list price of insulin — from the drug reimbursement system.""In the current system, companies give discounts to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans while increasing prices at the pharmacy counter,"" he said. He also believes that manufacturers need to lower list prices and restrict increases to ""no more than the consumer price index.""""If this occurs, we believe that strong competition among insulin manufacturers will quickly push them to lower prices to net levels, which will greatly benefit patients who need this drug to survive,"" Kowalski said.Cigna's new pricing scheme is ""a step in the right direction,"" added Cynthia Rice, a senior vice president at the nonprofit, in an email.President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to lower drug prices and posted his blueprint for doing so in May. One of the primary intentions of the plan is to increase competition while allowing the federal government to negotiate Medicare drug prices directly.",https://t.co/i9XTUysDbm,news
Did Alex Smith Die at Age 26 Because He Couldn't Afford Insulin?,"An Associated Press analysis published in late September 2018 warned that prescription drug prices in the United States were still rising precipitously despite President Trump's vow to reduce them. During the first seven months of the year, the report said, prescription drug prices saw 96 increases for every cut.The human cost of runaway prescription drugs prices was dramatically illustrated in a meme shared on the Occupy Democrats Facebook page on 18 September:This is Alex Smith. He died this year at age 26 because he couldn't afford insulin in America. He made $35,000 a year as a restaurant manager, and couldn't afford his $450 a month health insurance with a $7,600 out-of-pocket deductible. The insulin he needed for diabetes was $1,300 a month. When he turned 26 and was kicked off his mom's insurance, he started rationing his life-saving insulin. He died a month later.The text is mostly accurate, although it has Smith's given name wrong (it was Alec, not Alex), and he died in 2017, not ""this year"" as claimed in the 2018 meme.According to local news reports, Alec Raeshawn Smith's lifeless body was found in his apartment on 27 June 2017, 27 days after his coverage under his mother's health insurance policy had lapsed due to his age. The cause of death was diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces excess blood acids (called ketones) because it lacks enough insulin.In a piece contributed to Truthout.org in February 2018, Smith's mother, Nicole Smith-Holt, wrote that even though Alec had a full-time job, it did not come with employer-provided health coverage:For Alec, this meant that his insulin and supplies cost almost $1,300 a month. He and I together researched for months in advance about his health insurance options. They weren't good. The best plan we found would cost him $450 a month for the premium with a whopping $7,600 deductible. That deductible meant he would be paying out-of-pocket for his medicine for many months anyway, so he decided to go without the plan until he could find a different job with benefits.The prohibitive cost drove Smith to ration his insulin use to try to make his supply stretch to the next payday. ""I have since learned that this is not uncommon,"" Smith-Holt wrote, and is indicative of a worsening health care crisis:Globally, half of the people who need insulin can't reliably get access to it. With 6 million people in the US insulin-dependent, and nearly 40 percent of Americans uninsured or facing high deductibles that leave their medicine costs uncovered, the crisis is occurring right here, too.Endocrinologists here in the US report that as many as one in five of their patients are not able to afford their insulin. For many persons with diabetes, that means they land in the emergency room with diabetic ketoacidosis. For others, like Alec, they never get there. Just 27 days after his coverage under my insurance ended, I received the call no parent ever wants to get.The American Diabetes Association released a report in March 2018 estimating that the total costs of diagnosed diabetes in the United States had risen 26 percent in the previous five years:People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of $16,752 per year, of which about $9,601 is attributed to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures approximately 2.3 times higher than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes….People with diabetes who do not have health insurance have 60% fewer physician office visits and are prescribed 52% fewer medications than people with insurance coverage — but they also have 168% more emergency department visits than people who have insurance.In November 2017, we confirmed the similar case of Shane Patrick Boyle, an uninsured type 1 diabetic who died of ketoacidosis shortly after starting a GoFundMe campaign to try to raise enough money for a one-month supply of insulin.",https://t.co/7obrQYUuby,news

Valeritas' V-Go(R) Wearable Insulin Delivery Device Demonstrates a Reduction in A1c Levels by 1.5 and Total Daily Insulin Dosage by 14%,"BRIDGEWATER, Apr 26, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Valeritas Holdings, Inc. VLRX, -3.07% a medical technology company and maker of V-Go Wearable Insulin Delivery device, today announced results from the VERDICT study at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Annual Meeting. The VERDICT study demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes who switched to V-Go can improve their average blood sugar levels (A1c) with less insulin. VERDICT is a real-world retrospective analysis conducted by Dr. Trisha Zeidan, Premier Physician Network, Bull Family Diabetes Center. The study utilized electronic health records from a large specialized diabetes center to identify patients exceeding glycemic targets (A1c &gt; 7.0) prescribed insulin therapy or naive to insulin at baseline, and who changed to V-Go between January 2013 and December 2016. ""The efficacy and insulin usage results from the VERDICT study demonstrate both the medical and economic value of V-Go for patients with type 2 diabetes prescribed insulin,"" said John Timberlake, President and Chief Executive Officer of Valeritas. ""Diabetes has become a major healthcare issue and we have demonstrated through strong, real-world evidence the use of V-Go by patients with type 2 diabetes can reduce not only their A1c levels but also lower their total daily insulin usage."" This retrospective analysis of 139 patients with type 2 diabetes evaluated the effect V-Go had on patients' A1c, insulin total daily dose (TDD), concomitant non-insulin diabetes medication, and reported hypoglycemia. Patients using V-Go had an average reduction in A1c levels of -1.5 (p&lt;0.01) with a decrease in insulin TDD of 14% (p&lt;0.01). In addition, the percent of patients prescribed concomitant medications decreased and documented hypoglycemia decreased from baseline. About Valeritas Holdings, Inc.

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/Y7v3LTiDeo,news
"Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software Defined Radios","Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software DefinedÂ RadiosReverse Engineering an Insulin Pump for DIY Closed Loop TherapyRoughly 3 years ago, I heard about a website offering a bounty for something that was very close to my heart: reverse engineering communications to an insulin pump. My daughter was already using a system that I had helped to create called Loop, with a Medtronic pump that I had reverse engineered the RF comms forÂ¹. But the Medtronic pump required her to disconnect during her gymnastics for hours at a time. The tubeless design of this Omnipod pump sounded great, and I had all the tools to start working on the problem.The Omnipod system consists of a small disposable pump called a pod, and a controlling unit called a PDM.Because the PDM communicates with the pod using radio and the pod has no built in interface, it means the pod is entirely controllable over the radio. There was the potential to create a full integration with Loop using just a RileyLink, or a modified version of it.James Wedding had put up the bounty, and it attracted a lot of attention, and ultimately the right people who would be needed to make progress.Software DefinedÂ RadioSDRs are awesome tools; they make the hidden world of radio visible. There are all kinds of messages zipping by all the time, and these tools let you poke around, see the messages, and with some work, start decoding the little blips you see there. If you're looking for messages from a specific device, you need to know what general area to start looking in. That's where the FCC public filings come in handy.The FCC filing for the PDM, RBV-019, shows that the device transmits in the 433MHz range. Configuring the SDR software to listen in the 433MHz range while issuing a status from the PDM shows comms like this:As I eventually learned, those two bright lines are indicative of a certain type of modulation called frequency shift keying, or FSK. This means that the frequency of the signal varies with the information being transmitted. A 1 bit is sent as a higher frequency (the top line) and a 0 bit is sent with a slightly lower frequency (the bottom line). And using the tool inspectrum we can have it analyze the data to more clearly show the 1's and 0's. Here's a very zoomed in view of that first message above:I ended up writing a python script to extract these bits so we could look at them as a whole packet.It turns out this repeating pattern was part of the preamble. To conserve energy, receivers often have a pattern of sleeping, and waking up periodically to check for a signal. The transmitter sends a preamble long enough to catch the receiver during one of the short listening periods. When the receiver hears the preamble, it stays awake until the real data shows up.There was one more layer we had to get through before we were looking at actual packet data. You can't send your data over the radio exactly as the original bits, because the receiver uses the transitions to synchronize in time when to expect the next bit. If you have a long set of 1's or 0's, the receiver could get out of sync. So radio communications usually use an encoding to make sure there are enough transitions. The Omnipod communications use an encoding called Manchester encoding. Each bit is encoded by two bits. A 1 bit is encoded as 10, and a 0 bit is encoded as 01.This all took a lot of hashing out and there were a lot of theories shared in the openomni slack, as we tried to make getting the raw bits repeatable. Mark Brighton, Dan Caron, and @larsonlr, had been having some success with using RFCat and a TI Stick to capture packets. Evariste Courjaud would eventually write a tool called rtlomni used an rtl-sdr stick to listen for packets and decode them that would prove to be very convenient and more reliable than the TI-Stick based methods.Decoding PacketsOnce we had the actual bits of the packet, we started to look into packet structure. Based on what bits were changing between different pods, and different commands, we pieced together an understanding that looked like this.CRC8Radio is a far from perfect transmission medium. There are many different sources of interference that can make the receiver hear a 1 when a 0 was sent, and vice versa. It's important to know when this has happened, so most protocols use a checksum of sorts, often something called a CRC. The receiver computes the CRC as it receives the data, and the last byte of the packet includes the CRC as the transmitter computed it. If they don't match, the receiver throws the packet away and waits for a retransmission.The Omnipod protocol used a standard 8-bit CRC, so when we found this, we thought we were really close to having the messages figured out. Little did we know…Messages, CRC16Some messages are too big to fit into a single packet, so they are sent as multiple packets. We started to piece together the format of messages, and noticed another set of bits at the end of each message that looked like a 16-bit crc. But it was weird; 5 of the 16 bits were never set. We tried many different techniques to figure out how this was being set, but nothing worked.This was the first big blocker; we could proceed to work out what the other bits in the messages were, but it would be little help to understand what was being sent, but not be able to generate new packets ourselves, and so progress slowed down.Months passed with little progress, and finally in winter of 2016 a member of the group with the handle @lorelai posted that she had sucessfully dumped the firmware from the larger ARM-based chip on the PDM, and started the tedious process of disassembly: taking cpu instructions and turning them into human understandable code with semantic variable and function names. She did an amazing job figuring out what various methods were involved in sending data over the radio.I was looking at one of the unnamed routines, and noticed it looked like a standard implementation of a table based CRC calculation. And the table had the values for a standard 16 bit CRC. I wrote my own implementation using the table, and it checked out like a normal CRC. Then I looked closely at how the function was written. A normal CRC implementation looks like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &lt;&lt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Theirs looked like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Spot the difference? What should've been a bitwise left shift operator had somehow been coded as a right shift. This is a bug; there is no reason to cripple your own CRC algorithm, as it makes it less likely to catch corrupted messages.We were up and running again! We started working on decoding messages, recording sessions from the PDM for delivering boluses, temp basals, suspends, etc…NonceAll of the insulin delivery commands had a 4-byte chunk of data near the beginning of the message that looked like it might be some form of cryptography. Again, we tried many different ways of interpreting it, and analyzing it in the context of the messages it was sent in, but it wasn't a crc (we'd see the same 4 bytes on occasion even when the message data was different). And sometimes we'd see the pattern repeat. It looked maybe this was a bit of the protocol designed to prevent replay of data. Other protocols had features like this, called a nonce.One possible route we had considered was to record a database of messages to replay for given commands. Even if the address of each pod was different, now that we knew how to generate the message crc, we could take a copy of the command we had seen before, put a new address on the message, and recompute the crc. Except this nonce was preventing us from using that strategy. For the next insulin delivery command, no matter what command was sent, the pod would only accept the next nonce in the sequence, and we didn't know how to generate the next nonce.But hey! We have the decompiled PDM firmware now, we can just look there! So we pored over the PDM firmware, and tracked down the message generation in the code, and found where those four bytes should be. But instead of a method computing some cryptographic Nonce, we just found the four characters ""INS.. WTF?!?! Ok, somehow this area of the message must be being updated later in the pipeline.There was another chip on the PDM, closer to the radio. It was the same chip that was used in the Pods, a chip with an identifier of SC9S08ER48, something that wasn't documented online, and was likely produced custom for Insulet. Maybe we could get the firmware off of that chip. Unfortunately, that chip was locked, which prevented dumping of firmware.Again, progress slowed… This felt like a real dead end. We had thrown all our smarts at this nonce, and didn't have any good leads on the math that was behind it. And the ER48 that (possibly) held the secrets was locked and it was hard to find any public details that might help us crack it.X-Ray imagesIn trying to understand more about the ER48, some members of the slack community offered to try to get Xray images, which was really cool, but unfortunately didn't open up any new avenues.Overview XrayDetail XrayDecapping andÂ ImagingDan Caron decided to reach out to a researcher, Dr. Sergei Skorobogatov, at the University of Cambridge in the UK that he had read about who had experience in extracting code from locked chips, and convinced him to take a look at our problem. Dr. Skorobogatov had led research in using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) for chip reverse engineering and suggested it might be possible, but would be expensive, needing access to expensive equipment, and not guaranteed. Joe Moran, who had recently started using Loop after we met at the Fall 2016 Nightscout Hackathon dove in to helping out with this project, and arranged with a bay area company, Nanolab Technologies, to perform the decapping and imaging of the chips, and also graciously funded Nanolab and Dr Skorobogatov's work (and also his personal boxes of pods).Dr. Skorobogatov had Nanolab perform a variety of imaging techniques to ascertain if the protection could be defeated with known non-invasive or semi-invasive methods. This resulted in a lot of images, some of them very beautiful. These are optical microscope pictures of the silicon die.Optical microscope dieÂ overviewOptical microscope dieÂ overviewThere were also images taken of specific areas of the die using scanning electron microscopy. Attempts were made with different voltages, different surface preparations, and different equipment.SEM Image of flash memory cells. Not resolving data.Unfortunately, none of these produced images capable of resolving the actual contents of the flash.Dr. Skorobogatov had one last resort method that was only to be used if these other techniques failed. It was a proprietary method that would have to be given the blessing to be used by the University. Dr. Skorobogatov did an initial test and confirmed that it was capable of resolving the data on this chip. But before we could proceed an NDA had to be agreed upon and so negotiations about who was to be the recipient of the extracted firmware were undertaken.The Nightscout foundation would ultimately be the party signing the NDA and would take the responsibility to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the methods and results of the extraction.The result of this arrangement and work was an incredible paper written by Dr Sergei Skorobogatov, and the raw firmware data. The initial extraction of the firmware had a significant number of errors, but was enough to get started on. Joe asked at the spring Nightscout Foundation Hack if anyone would be up for digging into the disassembly. Nobody raised their hands. Turning the cpu instructions into something understandable is painstaking work, and there are very few people who know how to do it. I tried digging into it, using cpu instruction documentation, but made very little progress, and grew frustrated. Others optimistically asked for request to the firmware with big expectations of fast progress, and then realized the scope and challenge of the task and quietly dropped off.Example disassembly of SC908 instructionsIt turns out Joe also has an extensive background working at the assembly level, and started taking on the onerous task himself. In July, Dr. Skorobogatov had completed a second extraction with much fewer errors. Over the summer Joe Moran worked tirelessly on mapping out the huge amount of cpu instructions, and slowly fitting them together into a larger picture of pod pseudocode.Eventually, Ken Shirriff, an expert in hardware reverse engineering, would join the effort and sped up the process considerably. Together, Joe and Ken eventually mapped out enough code to find the function responsible for coding the nonce September of 2017.RileyLink andÂ LoopWe had been updating the openomni python scripts with our understanding of the comms, but now it was time to start focusing on RileyLink + iOS, so I started work on OmniKit, and firmware updates for the RileyLink. I believed we had the fundamentals of the protocol worked out, and the rest was just details. Again, completely underestimating how much more was ahead of us.I had to write new firmware that would handle the pod modulation and encoding. I also had to rewrite the way the two chips on the RL talked to each other to handle 0's, as 0 was a special end of packet marker for Medtronic. Much in Loop needed to be reworked to support multiple Pumps, and new interfaces made to support pairing, deactivating, and handling faults. Thankfully Nate Racklyeft had set a solid foundation in Loop for this to happen.Meanwhile, work on understanding the format of the commands continued and was documented thoroughly on the openomni wiki, which is the most comprehensive documentation on the pod protocol published publicly. Joe, Evariste, and Eelke Jager really did a massive amount of work decoding messages, and updating the pages over time. Various members of the slack channel have contributed captures of PDM to Pod communications to aid decoding efforts.The decoding was fun work, with lots of small wins as each component of each command is deciphered, and I really enjoyed working on this part, and adding code to Loop to implement. In April of 2018 I shared on slack that I had ""paired via iPhone + RL, primed, cannula insertion, basal schedule programmed, and then bolused 5U.The 2.0 RL firmware was finished in July of 2018, and new shipments started including it. It was hoped that these boards would be able to be used with Loop and Omnipod, but the existing 915 MHz antenna would prove to be too poor to do 433 MHz comms effectively.Decoding and implementation was progressed well over the summer, and the Loop experience was coming together. Joe did an amazing thing in providing funding for me to quit my day job, and focus more on this project, and to eventually join the wonderful Tidepool team. There were of course more events happening outside of the omnipod RE story in the DIY and regulator spaces that I won't cover, but it was a very interesting summer!ScreamersAs more functionality came online in the driver, I started hooking it up into Loop, including the ability to automatically adjust delivery by temp basals. At this point it was fairly common to get a screaming pod, which meant some of the pod's internal checking had detected a situation where it decided there was a problem and it should not continue to deliver insulin.But it seemed like a workable problem, as we continued to find small discrepancies in what Loop was sending versus what the PDM would send if the command was delivered manually, and I assumed if we fixed all of those that the screaming would stop.Looping!On October 3, 2018, Joe put a Loop controlled pod on himself and became the first Loop Omnipod user, but didn't tell me immediately as he knew I'd be worrying. When he did tell me, I still worried. We had seen the pod work, and understood the functionality, and the basic algorithm of Loop had been vetted for a long time, but still…A month later, at the November 2018 Nightscout Hackathon, a few more adventurous souls opted try it out for themselves as well, and became part of a small private testing group that would grow to over 30 people before the branch was made public.Unfortunately, we still had screamers often happening before the full 3 days of use were finished, and we had meticulously compared Loop's commands to PDM reference versions. Eelke was particularly helpful with this process, creating a script that could check commands against their reference versions automatically. I started to get worried that the increased demands on the battery for doing communication every five minutes had pushed the pod over the edge of what was sustainable.Pod voltage taps, drilled through back plastic, super-glued inÂ place.So I started measuring pod voltage with an arduino, recording the data and storing it a local database for visualization. Comparing PDM and Loop.Long time scale view of podÂ voltage.Unfortunately, this proved to be a dead end as well; using a PDM and bolusing large amounts, I could drive the pod to lower voltages than even Loop would do over the life of a looping pod, and wasn't able to make the pod scream. It seemed like voltage wasn't the issue, so there must be something else.RileyLinks with 955 MHz (left) and coil 433 MHz (right)Â antennasAt one point I noticed that if a message exchange with the pod failed, the pod would sometimes be left in a state of trying to complete the exchange by re-sending packets over and over and over. Testers logs were also showing lots of failures, and so I started experimenting with antennas. Both of these problems should be improved with better comms. I had planned on trying different antennas and had ordered from random places on the internet, but hadn't had time to try them until it became a priority.I had some flexible 433 MHz antennas that could be taped on the inside of the RL case. These would often have great performance in some scenarios, but not in others; it was too unreliable. When I got to the coil based one, it had good performance very consistently, and at very surprising ranges. Time for a new RileyLink case.With the new antenna, and some optimizations to do fewer message exchanges while still allowing adjustments every 5 minutes, the frequency of screamers went down to a very low rate. Likely comparable to using a pod normally with a PDM. In the most recent 7,500 hours of live testing, 94% of pods completed without faults.Testing and DocumentationThe testing group grew slowly, which was a great way to continually get new eyes on the system and see what parts were confusing. These testers put up with a lot of screaming pods, and contributed in very big ways to making Loop with Omnipod work better. They did this primarily by sharing issue reports from each of their pods, whether successful or not.The issue reports have a message log in them that could be analyzed by the tool that Eelke built, giving us insight into whether we had any misformatted commands and also let us gather statistics around certain parts of Loop's interaction with the pods.Marion Barker joined the testing group and added dedicated reporting, and additional statistics to the progress of testing, and we were able to use her stats of successful pods vs failures to have a high level view of progress.Eventually Katie DiSimone joined the testing group, and started a large restructuring of loopdocs.org to provide documentation for using Loop with multiple devices. The anticipation around a version of Loop that worked with Omnipod was incredibly high, and without good documentation, it was certain that we'd be flooded with the same questions over and over.New Features ForÂ LoopOmnipod integration required rethinking of some interface elements, and adding new controls. The pod doesn't report battery, and there is little a user can do about a low battery if one were to somehow happen, so displaying a battery level widget didn't make sense. Also, without a UI on the pump, the user needs to be able to cancel a bolus quickly. The reservoir icon was a picture of a Medtronic reservoir, so we wanted to rethink that. Thank you to Paul Forgione for designing the pod logo that now shows reservoir level.ThanksThank you to all the people who help make this long road come to a place where we can share this with others, and realize the goal that we set out to do a long time ago. I know I didn't cover everyone, and everything that happened. That would be impossible in a single post, and for me, since I only have my experience through this. It's hard to imagine the total hours put into this. If you could add them all up, I'm sure it would be shocking. Not to mention the work that has gone into making the Omnipod itself, which I imagine dwarfs this effort. So thank you *all*. Also, many of those hours would otherwise have been spent with families. I really appreciate my wife and kids being understanding with the time I've spent on this, and want to thank them too.SidenotesI have to mention Joakim Ornstedt, as one of the contributors to openomni decoding, and also the creator of what is probably actually the first looping integration with omnipod. He built a device that used optical character recognition (OCR) on the PDM to get data from the PDM, and wired in digital button presses to the PDM through another microcontroller. It's a hard to scale approach, but very clever, and bypasses a lot of the issues we had to deal with for an RE based solution. I really admired him for pulling this off, and getting looping in a tiny fraction of the time it took to make it work with Loop.",https://t.co/KADlyNUSVO,news
Sanofi provides unprecedented access to its insulins for one set monthly price,"People exposed to high out-of-pocket prices at the pharmacy counter can participate in the Insulins Valyou Savings Program regardless of income level. This includes those who are paying high retail prices for their insulin and those who don't qualify for other patient assistance programs. Under current government regulations, pharmaceutical companies cannot offer this type of program to patients insured under Medicare, Medicaid, or similar federal or state programs, though Sanofi supports changing rules to expand this access program to all those who might benefit. Kelly L. Close, co-founder, The diaTribe Foundation, and president, Close Concerns, said, ""Sanofi is taking this vital, transformational action to make its insulins more affordable through this program. The U.S. diabetes community is in the middle of a crisis, because our dysfunctional healthcare system doesn't allow equal, affordable, access to insulin. As patient advocates at diaTribe, we have been strongly urging manufacturers, insurers, healthcare providers, pharmacy benefit managers – and the government – to work together to help alleviate this problem. Today, we recognize Sanofi for their outstanding leadership in order to make their insulins available at a better price for all, regardless of income or dosing needs."" A year ago, Sanofi launched the Insulins Valyou Savings Program to enable those who pay cash to pay the set prices of $99 for one 10mL vial or $149 for a box of pens. Now, up to 10 boxes of pens and/or 10mL vials will cost $99 per month. Since it was launched last April, the program has resulted in approximately $10 million in patient savings. The program is available at U.S. pharmacies.""As premiums on insurance plans continue to climb, some people living with diabetes have had to exit the higher premiums so they can find ways to pay less. The result may be the loss of prescription benefits,"" said Lon Chenowith, who has been living with diabetes for more than 30 years. ""That was what I was forced to do last year. Sanofi has savings programs for people who have been prescribed their insulin that can help them save on prescription costs. They have been a big encouragement to people like me.""

Walmart's $25 insulin can't fix the diabetes drug price crisis,"Health care executives faced the ire of lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday, amid a growing outcry from patients who've been forced to ration insulin because of soaring prices.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) told a panel of insulin manufacturers and drug industry intermediaries assembled for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on insulin prices. ""I just want you to know your days are numbered.""While the executives fumbled to explain themselves over the course of two days of questioning, one ""solution"" to the insulin access crisis resurfaced on social media: Patients should just buy cheap insulin at Walmart.For context, the cost of the four most popular insulins has tripled over the past decade, forcing many of the millions of Americans with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who rely on the drug to skimp on or skip doses. Walmart indeed offers a relatively inexpensive choice, essentially over the counter. People can go to pharmacies in stores nationwide and, without a prescription, purchase a vial of Novo Nordisk's Novolin ReliOn Insulin for less than $25. (People with diabetes can require between one and six vials of insulin per month.)But there's a problem here: This low-cost option is far from ideal for all patients. Ultimately, ""Walmart-ism,"" as diabetes advocates call it, reveals a lot about what the debate around the insulin drug pricing crisis has become: a big blame game, filled with distractions from what's really driving up drug prices. The problems with Walmart's insulinDoctors and diabetes advocates point out that while ReliOn may help patients in a pinch, especially those without health insurance, it's also a formulation (known as ""human"" insulin) that came on the market in the 1980s, more than a decade before more refined insulins started to emerge. The newer insulins, known as analogs, appear to be more effective at preventing dangerous blood sugar swings in people with Type 1 diabetes or those at a higher risk for severe low blood sugar. (The evidence of insulin analog's benefits is less clear for Type 2 diabetes, but the studies are also low quality so it's difficult to make conclusive statements.) There's one more problem: Because it's available without a prescription, patients can get the drug without the supervision of a doctor, and they sometimes get into trouble as a result. So stories have surfaced about patients who required emergency care because of severe blood sugar highs and lows after self-dosing with Walmart insulin, or even dying as a result. ""Human insulins are a reasonable option for many patients with Type 2 diabetes,"" said Yale endocrinologist Kasia Lipska, who often prescribes the drugs for patients who can't afford newer formulations. ""But the drug isn't optimal for everybody. And human insulin sold at Walmart is definitely not the solution to our insulin crisis.""For people with Type 1 diabetes, human insulins ""are harder to live on, lead to worse control, make it harder to hold down a job, impact quality of life,"" said James Elliott, a trustee at T1International, an independent patient advocacy group, ""and not everyone lives near a Walmart."" A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the low-cost formulation is also available at CVS and Express Scripps, though patients have to apply for a discount program first. ""We have taken numerous steps to help make insulin more affordable for people living with diabetes,"" the spokesperson said. ""Approximately 775,000 people in the US use our human insulin."" So while it's true that Walmart offers insulin at a competitive price reminiscent of the days before insulin costs tripled and that it can be helpful for some patients, it's not great for everybody with diabetes, and it can be dangerous for some. Walmart-ism is part of the insulin drug pricing blame gameThe Walmart solution first went viral in February, after it was featured on TV in Texas and then posted to Facebook. It continues to be bandied about on social media whenever people mention rising insulin prices. According to the meme, the problem isn't that insulin is too expensive. The problem is that patients are too picky to take advantage of an affordable insulin option. According to the pharmacy benefit managers testifying before Congress Tuesday, it's the insulin manufacturers' companies that are driving up the cost of the drug. At another congressional hearing Wednesday, pharmaceutical company executives blamed pharmacy benefit managers for helping inflate prices and boasted about their financial assistance programs as solutions to the access crisis. The blame game involves many fingers pointing in many directions, but make no mistake: What's driving up insulin costs is that drug companies have raised prices because they can. As I recently explained, the US is an outlier in insulin costs and spending. America represents only 15 percent of the global insulin market and generates almost half of the pharmaceutical industry's insulin revenue. Although insulin was discovered a century ago, manufacturers have made incremental changes to their formulations that have allowed them to extend the patents for these drugs. Even where patents have expired, the road to getting generic insulin on the market is so complicated and expensive that recent attempts have failed.So how did we get here? Unlike other countries, America gives drug companies free rein to set prices. The result is that the cost of the four most popular types of insulin has tripled over the past decade, and the out-of-pocket prescription costs patients now face have doubled. Let's break that down with some dollar figures. By 2016, the average list price of insulin rose to $450 per month. Patients can wind up paying out of pocket anything from $25 per month, if they have generous health insurance coverage or buy older insulin versions at Walmart, to more than $1,000 if they don't have insurance or have a high deductible plan, according to T1International. One quick fix to improve insulin access Lately there's been more attention on the insulin pricing problem. Members of Congress have been pressuring drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers to bring insulin costs under control. Last Wednesday, the insurance behemoth Cigna, and its pharmacy benefit arm Express Scripts, announced a new program that'll cap the 30-day cost of insulin at $25. That's a 40 percent reduction from the $41.50-per-month fee people with Express Scripts benefits were paying in 2018.This week, Sanofi announced it will offer its insulin products at $99 per month for uninsured patients. But like the Walmart option, these programs amount to Band-Aid solutions, said Elizabeth Pfiester, the founder and executive director of T1International. With Walmart, patients are ""having to revert to an older insulin that can damage you,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Sanofi and Cigna programs ""can be shut down or rescinded at any time. That's not any kind of assurance for patients."" ""Patients will not fall for these fake measures that do nothing to solve the crisis we are facing,"" she added.There's one way the insulin drug pricing problem could be fixed, however: lowering the price of insulin, said Yale's Lipska. ""Ultimately, it's the list price that's hurting patients. I keep going back to that: Just fix the list price."" Companies could decide that instead of launching one-off programs or doling out discounts, they'll forgo profits and lower list prices once and for all. Or lawmakers could decide to regulate drug pricing. ""We have a big problem here,"" Lipska said. ""People are hurting and people are dying. How much more will it take for them to regulate this? Clearly what's in place now is not working. This is a place where our legislators can step in and help protect the patients with diabetes."" Update, April 11: We've updated the story with quotes from Novo Nordisk, who responded to our request for comment after the story first published.",https://t.co/jbRnLuJKoy,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/w8SR5jeDc4,news

The Discovery of Insulin,"For many years scientists believed that some kind of internal secretion of the pancreas was the key to preventing diabetes and controlling normal metabolism. No one could find it, until in the summer of 1921 a team at the University of Toronto began trying a new experimental approach suggested by Dr. Frederick Banting. Dr. Charles H. Best and Dr. G.R. Williams check one of many experiments being conducted in the lab of the Charles H. Best Institute, University of Toronto. Image: National Film Board of Canada / Library and Archives Canada / PA-112972.For many years scientists believed that some kind of internal secretion of the pancreas was the key to preventing diabetes and controlling normal metabolism. No one couldfind it, until in the summer of 1921 a team at the University of Toronto began trying a new experimental approach suggested by Dr. Frederick Banting.By the spring of 1922, the Toronto researchers — Banting, Charles Best, J.B. Collip andtheir supervisor, J.J.R. Macleod, were able to announce the discovery of insulin. In 1923, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize for one of the most important,and most controversial, breakthroughs in modern medical history.Early ResearchFor many centuries people knew about diabetes mellitus (commonly referred to as diabetes), but it was only dimly understood until the end of the 19th century.Initially, the body's inability to process carbohydrates and other nutrients, signified most obviously by the presence of sugar in the urine, was thought to be a liver or a stomach disorder. In 1889 German researchers Oskar Minkowski and Josef von Mehringdiscovered that dogs that had their pancreas removed immediately became severely and fatally diabetic. Something in the pancreas appeared to be essential to prevent diabetes. Researchers immediately began to try to find the mysterious substance.Results were mostly negative; for example, feeding pancreas to diabetic patients did no good. Still, new knowledge about the body's dependence on chemical messengers — or hormones — added plausibility to the hypothesis that some kind of internal secretionof the pancreas maintains normal metabolism. The gland was already known to have an external secretion, digestive juices that flow into the duodenum. Another German researcher, Paul Langerhans, had discovered a separate system of cells in the pancreas,later named the islets of Langerhans, which came to be seen as the possible source of the elusive internal secretion. But how could the substance be separated from the rest of the pancreas?In the meantime diabetes in its severe form, which often struck children, was a horrible disease. Patients expelled excess sugar via their urine, lost weight and strength, suffered many other complications, eventually fell into a coma and then died. Researcherskept hoping that by feeding or injecting diabetic animals or humans with portions of pancreas they could cause an improvement in their condition. The most common test would be to try to lower urinary sugar, or perhaps the blood sugar of a diabetic subject.Until the hoped-for discovery emerged, about all that people with diabetes could do to hold off their disease was eat less and less — postponing death from diabetes by literally starving themselves.In the 30 years after Minkowski and von Mehring's 1889 discovery hundreds of investigators around the world tried to find the internal secretion. A few of them, Georg Zuelzer in Germany, E.L. Scott and Israel Kleiner in the United States, N.C. Paulescoin Romania, reported promising findings. Yet their pancreatic extracts functioned erratically and unconvincingly, often with harmful side effects. By 1920, some scientists had given up, thinking the whole idea of an internal secretion of the pancreaswas a wild goose chase. Others kept on searching; and by this time, they were starting to be able to use better tools, such as new techniques for quickly measuring sugar in the blood and urine.Frederick BantingFrederick Banting was the codeveloper of insulin and shared Canada's first Nobel Prize (artwork by Irma Coucill).On the night of 31 October 1920, Dr. Frederick Banting, a young physician and surgeon in the city of London,Ontario, jotted down this idea for research about the pancreas:Diabetus Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosurea.Banting, a farmer's son from Alliston, Ontario, had graduated in medicine from the University of Torontoin 1916, served in the First World War, done post-graduate work in surgery and, while starting up a medical practice in London, was earning extra income as a part-timeteacher in the physiology department at the local University of Western Ontario (now known as Western University). He developed his idea as a result of backgroundreading he was doing to prepare a talk to medical students about the pancreas. Banting had little experience at research or at treating (or even spelling) diabetes.Banting's reasoning was that possibly others had not been able to find the internal secretion in their pancreatic mixtures because it was being destroyed by the organ's well-known external secretion, the digestive juices produced in its acinar cellularsystem. Perhaps if the flow of digestive juices out of the pancreas could be stopped by surgically blocking or ligating the pancreatic ducts, then the pancreas would stop producing its external secretion. Its acinar cells would shrivel up, but its isletcells, perhaps the source of its internal secretion, would keep on producing the substance. It could then be isolated and used to treat diabetes.John J.R. MacleodFrederick Banting was advised at the University of Western Ontario to take his idea back to the University of Toronto, which had extensive research facilitiesunder the direction of a renowned physiologist and expert in carbohydrate metabolism, John James Rickard Macleod. At their first meeting, Macleod was skepticalabout both Banting's idea and his credentials as a researcher. Macleod knew that much better trained scientists had worked on much the same idea. But he had surplus capacity, including research animals and enthusiastic student helpers, in his laboratory.He decided that no harm could come from letting Dr. Banting try to succeed where others had failed. Macleod offered Banting lab space, dogs to work on and the services of a student assistant during the summer of 1921.One of Macleod's student helpers, Charles Best, won a coin toss to be the first to start work with Banting. Banting and Best began their experiments under Macleod's direction at the University of Toronto on 17 May 1921.University of Toronto ResearchFrederick Banting and Charles Best found that serious research was difficult, complicated and fraught with pitfalls. Doing pancreatic surgery to ligate the ducts of dogs wasfar from easy, especially during the sizzling Toronto heat of the summer of 1921. Accurately and consistently measuring the results of their work was also far from easy. Before J.J.R. Macleodleft to holiday in his native Scotland, he gave the young researchers detailed guidance on procedures to follow in their work, including crucial advice on how to prepare extracts of pancreas from duct-ligated dogs for injection into other depancreatized(thus diabetic) dogs.Banting and Best's laboratory where insulin was discovered (courtesy University of Toronto Archives/A1965-0004).Charles Best (left) and Frederick Banting, with a dog used in their experiments to isolate insulin (courtesy Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, U of T).Banting pressed on with great determination and an enthusiast's tendency to interpret his results always positively. On 30 July he and Best injected an extract of degenerated pancreas from a duct-ligated dog into another depancreatized, diabetic dog andobserved a sharp drop in its blood sugar. Injections of extract into other dogs (the dogs had no names, only numbers) often seemed to reduce blood sugar. When Macleod returned to Torontoat summer's end he was confronted by excited researchers who believed their experiments with what they called ""isletin"" were extremely successful.Macleod was much more critical. He required the duo to repeat and elaborate upon their work, while disagreeing sharply with Banting about facilities and resources. As experiments continued in the autumn of 1921, Banting and Best found that they coulddiscard the cumbersome procedure of duct-ligation. It was possible to make just as effective extract from fresh, chilled beef or pork pancreas obtainable at local slaughterhouses. Banting's great idea, it turned out, had been useful only to start theToronto research. In truth it was not particularly original, effective or even physiologically sound.James CollipThe real problem was to make their pancreatic extracts work consistently and convincingly to treat the symptoms of diabetes. Chilling the pancreas (which inhibited enzymeaction) had been an important step forward. The group also made progress with their techniques of trying to purify the ground-up tissue that seemed to contain the internal secretion.James B. Collip worked with Banting and Best on the discovery of insulin (courtesy Library and Archives Canada/C-37756).At Frederick Banting's request, J.J.R. Macleod added a skilled biochemistto the team in December 1921. James Bertram Collip was a Toronto-educated professor at theUniversity of Alberta, who had returned to the city to work for a few months with Macleod on other research. Collip immediately began improving Banting and CharlesBest's crude and inconsistently effective extracts. Still, the first presentation of the Toronto research at the end of December, by Banting and Best, to the American Physiological Society, met substantial criticism from an audience of distinguisheddiabetologists. The pattern of their results, though perhaps promising, did not yet seem to be significantly better than others had reported.In January 1922 the Toronto group decided they could safely begin testing their pancreatic extracts on human subjects. On 11 January pancreatic extract made by Banting and Best was injected into the body of Leonard Thompson, a 14-year old boy on the brinkof death from diabetes in Toronto General Hospital. Everyone was disappointed when measurements showed the test was a failure. But 12 days later, on 23 January, the team resumed administration of extract on Thompson, and now had spectacular success.His blood and urinary sugars went to normal and his other diabetic symptoms were alleviated. The group knew they were on to something very big in medicine.The key to the breakthrough on Thompson was that Collip, working furiously, had been able to develop an improved extraction process to remove toxic contaminants from Banting and Best's extract. His purer extract worked consistently and effectively, suggestingvery powerfully that the Toronto team had indeed discovered the internal secretion of the pancreas.The work now proceeded at a feverish pace. The group, which continued to expand, published a preliminary report of its clinical trials on Thompson and several other patients in the Canadian Medical Association Journal on 22 March 1922. On 3May 1922, Macleod delivered a paper, ""The Effects Produced on Diabetes by Extracts of Pancreas,"" at the Washington, DC, meeting of the Association of American Physicians, in which the team first used the word ""insulin."" Macleod had suggested this useof a Latin root for islets. The paper's authors were F.G. Banting, C.H. Best, J.B. Collip, W.R. Campbell, A.A. Fletcher, J.J.R. Macleod and E.C. Noble. (Campbell and Fletcher were the clinicians who administered the extract on patients; Noble was anotheryoung physiologist).The audience gave the Toronto researchers a standing ovation. In the eyes of most of the world this was Toronto's announcement of the discovery of insulin.For many years afterwards, the University of Toronto supervised insulin production on the basis of patents given to it by members of the discovery team. It licensed manufacturers, who, by the end of 1923, were able to make insulin available to victimsof diabetes around the world. The addition of chemist Peter Moloney to the team in the spring of 1922 had marked a turning point in its production operations. The process Moloney developed for purifying insulin made it possible to produce the substancein large quantities.Nobel PrizeGlobal excitement at the sudden appearance of an effective treatment for diabetes masked a nearly incredible story of rivalries and bitterness among the researchers involved.Frederick Banting had had the idea that started everything. He thought that he and Charles Best,working mainly on their own, had discovered the internal secretion with their dog experiments in the summer and autumn of 1921. Banting had never liked J.J.R. Macleod;and he thought James Collip — with whom he had had at least one violent confrontation in the lab — had only added somewhat to the purification of insulin. Banting hadwell-placed friends in Toronto. Knowing that a Nobel Prize might well be awarded for insulin, they workedvery hard to have Banting honoured, at home and abroad, as the discoverer of insulin.Among experienced scientists there was more support for the view that Banting and Best's somewhat fumbling researches would not have reached the goal without the contributions of both Macleod and Collip — along with other workers, such as those who hadmade recent crucial advances in the ability to measure and track changes in blood sugar levels. In its deliberations for the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the Nobel Committee of the Caroline Institute in Sweden concluded that Banting wouldnot have found the way to insulin without the guidance of Macleod. They awarded the 1923 prize — one of the fastest honourings of a discovery in the history of the awards — to Banting and Macleod. Banting immediately announced that Best should have beenhonoured and that he would divide his prize money equally with his young partner. Macleod announced that he would divide his prize money equally with Collip.The Nobel Prize for insulin became highly controversial. Banting's admirers, joined by Best and his friends, insisted that Macleod was improperly recognized, and that the award should have gone to Banting and Best. Years of propaganda, involving extensivedistortion of history, established in the popular mind, especially in Canada, the view that insulin had been discovered by Banting and Best. Macleod and Collip became forgotten men.Scientists and medical historians were more inclined to the view that the discovery of insulin involved a collaborative effort by a team of scientists — Banting, Best, Collip, Macleod and others. This is now the more accepted view at the University ofToronto and in other informed circles. From time to time there have also been campaigns to claim that one or other of the earlier researchers — Zuelzer, Scott, Paulesco and others — was the real discoverer of insulin. These claims have not been widelycredited.SignificanceAt Toronto's Nobel Prize dinner in 1923, a wise scientist dismissed the honours controversy with the comment ""in insulin there is glory enough for all."" Millions of diabetessufferers around the world were less interested in battles for scientific prestige and power than they were in the fact that out of Canada had emerged a therapy that gave them relief from their disease. With the discovery of insulin, the primary questionof diabetes became one of the quality of life, not the speed of death. Building on the contributions of their predecessors the Toronto group of Frederick Banting,Charles Best, James Collip and J.J.R. Macleodhad brought about a dramatic breakthrough, and one of medical research's earliest successes.",https://t.co/8PlSKWYsa8,news

The soaring cost of insulin,"In 1923, the patent for insulin was sold for one dollar to make it widely-available as a treatment for diabetes. Nearly a century later, a report released earlier this month says the price is skyrocketing in the U.S. And that has implications for Canada. The Health Care Cost Institute, an independent, not-for-profit research institute, looked at health insurance claims in the U.S. for thousands of Americans with Type 1 diabetes enrolled in employee health insurance plans. In 2012 the annual cost of insulin per person $2,900 US. By 2016, the annual cost had gone up to just over $5,700. That's a 97 per cent increase in just four years. A more long-term study found that between 2002 and 2013, the typical cost for patients increased from roughly $40 per vial of insulin to $130.The rising cost of insulin is the single biggest reason why the average annual cost per patient to manage their diabetes went from $12,500 in 2012 to $18,500 in 2016. There are lots of U.S. media reports of people paying $400 per month and more.If the patent for insulin was sold for a dollar, why is the cost going up? The simple answer is that this isn't your great grandmother's insulin. For decades, the insulin doctors prescribed was derived from animals and injected with a very basic needle and syringe.Today, insulin is manufactured using bacteria in which a copy of the gene for human insulin has been inserted. Insulin itself has been modified chemically to make versions that work faster or last longer. The delivery system has changed a lot. Instead of needles and syringes, there are insulin pumps, pens and other methods. And, there are all kinds of machines that measure blood glucose.Sir Frederick Banting, seen here in this 1921 photograph, is credited as one of the co-discoverers of insulin. (Sir Frederick Banting House)One can argue about the ethics, but each of these inventions comes with a new patent, and a new opportunity to jack up the price.Rationing insulin There are some startling differences in price between the U.S. and Canada. According to one report, the retail price of a vial of Humalog in the U.S. is $300. In Canada, the same vial costs $32. According to media reports, a growing number of Americans cross the border into Canada to get their insulin. The FDA permits cross-border dispensing of up to a three-month supply, provided it's for personal use.Canada is better than the U.S. at regulating the price of insulin. Still, a report by the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) found that on average, Canadians spend more than $1,500 Cdn per year on diabetes medications, devices and supplies. In general, Canadians with Type 1 diabetes pay more than those with Type 2 diabetes. And, if you're on an insulin pump, you pay a lot more. Exactly how much Canadians pay depends in large part on the province in which they live.There is evidence that the cost of managing diabetes has a direct impact on their health. In the U.S., there are reports of people having to choose between their insulin and paying rent and other household expenses. A study by researchers at Yale University found one in four patients skimp on insulin. There are several thousand GoFundMe campaigns related to insulin.The CDA found that 57 per cent of Canadians did not comply fully with their treatment due to the cost of medications, devices and supplies. Rationing insulin and other treatments can result in complications like eye problems and kidney disease. It also also lead to diabetic emergencies and even death. A study just published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine found that diabetes tops the list of conditions bringing older patients to the emergency department.The CDA has called on governments to make diabetes treatments more affordable by enhancing the Disability Tax Credit. It has also called for a more equitable access to medications, devices and supplies across all provinces and a common drug formulary to standardize access.The Open Insulin Project is a team of self-described ""biology nerds"" who are developing the first freely available, open protocol for insulin production. They hope that their research will be the basis for generic production of insulin. One article suggests that the project could enable patients to ""home brew"" their own diabetic treatments at a fraction of the cost.A report estimates that as many as 2,000 patients have built their own insulin pumps and electronic monitoring systems. DIY diabetes treatment may one day be a viable option.Just don't count on it anytime soon.",https://t.co/ept4Q8tVx6,news

Patients face expensive ER bills even when they don't receive treatment,"On October 19, 2016, Jessica Pell fainted and hit her head on a nearby table, cutting her ear. She went to the emergency room at Hoboken University Medical Center, where she was given an ice pack. She received no other treatment. She never received any diagnosis. But a bill arrived in the mail for $5,751. ""It's for the ice pack and the bandage,"" Pell said of the fee. ""That is the only tangible thing they could bill me for.""Pell's experience is not unique. Submissions to Vox's ER database project found multiple examples of ERs charging patients hundreds or even thousands of dollars for walking through the door. Some never got past the waiting room. Some were triaged, but none received treatment from a doctor. Pell left the ER when she discovered the plastic surgeon who would see her was out of network for her insurance. She decided to go to an in-network facility instead. She thought this was a smart way to avoid the costly fees that came with seeing a provider that wasn't included in her health plan. ""I decided to decline treatment because I can't really afford any surprise bills right now,"" she said. ""The bill I'd probably incur would not be worth saving my ear, which was sad but a choice I had to make.""Pell's health insurance plan paid the hospital $862, what it deemed a ""reasonable and appropriate"" fee for the services the hospital paid. That left Pell with a $4,989 bill that she received on February 28. ""There was no way to avoid this,"" Pell, at home in her apartment, says of her $5,751 emergency room bill. Jennifer Brown for Vox ""There was no way for me to have avoided this bill, to have known what I would have been charged,"" Pell says. Hoboken University Medical Center, where Pell was seen, declined to comment on the bill. The hospital did, according to Pell, reverse the entire balance after Vox began inquiring about the fees.""While we cannot comment on rates for emergency room services, we are reaching out directly to the patient to work on a settlement/resolution to her satisfaction,"" said CarePoint Health spokesperson Jennifer Morrill.High bills but no treatmentPell's story is not unique. In the past six months, Vox has collected more than 1,000 emergency room bills submitted by readers in all 50 states and Washington, DC, as part of an investigation into emergency room billing practices.The dominant storyline to emerge is what anyone who has visited an emergency room might expect: Treatment is expensive. And when health insurance plans don't pay, patients are left with burdensome bills. Our database revealed another side to emergency room billing. Patients can face steep bills even when they didn't receive treatment. Multiple patients submitted bills to our database for ER visits where they declined treatment because they learned it would be out of network, were frustrated with the wait time, or began to feel better. They all ended up with significant medical bills, in the hundreds or thousands of dollars. These fees were often on top of additional fees from another health care provider where they ultimately did receive treatment.Carolyn Wallace, for example, recently brought her 4-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, to an emergency room in Texas. The young girl ran into a coffee table and cut her forehead above her left eyebrow. Wallace first went to an urgent care clinic, which directed her to the emergency room at Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in Houston. There, she and her daughter waited for about an hour. The only medical care Elizabeth received in that time, Wallace says, was a physician assistant taking her temperature.Wallace ultimately decided to leave and seek treatment at a different urgent care clinic, where her daughter was seen quickly and received liquid stitches. Then the bills for the emergency room started coming: about $300 from the hospital and an additional $669 from the physician assistant who took Elizabeth's temperature.""I just felt that it was an exorbitant fee that was not at all in correlation to the service provided,"" Wallace says. ""It seemed really out of line with the situation. They didn't give me new gauze or a bandage or replace the paper towel we brought from home. They didn't give me anything to clean it with.""The hospital reversed the $300 bill when Wallace protested. The larger doctor's bill came from a third-party physician staffing company called Team Health, which Wallace is attempting to protest as well. A spokesperson for Team Health did not return Vox's requests for comment.These bills show the steep costs that emergency rooms can charge just for walking through their doors. The $300 fee that Wallace was charged is typically called a ""facility fee,"" the price of entering the facility regardless of what happens afterward. Hospital executives often argue that these fees help them keep the lights on and doors open for whatever emergency might come through their doors, anything from a stubbed toe to a stroke patient.But experts who study emergency billing question how these fees are set and charged, noting that they are seemingly arbitrary, varying widely from one hospital to another. A Vox analysis of these fees, published last year, shows that the prices rose 89 percent between 2009 and 2015 — rising twice as quickly as overall health care prices.""It is having a dramatic effect on what people spend in a hospital setting,"" says Niall Brennan, executive director of the Health Care Cost Institute, which provided the data for that analysis. ""And as we know, that has a trickle-down effect on premiums and benefits.""Facility fees typically are not made public, meaning patients only learn what their emergency room charges when they receive the bill. Patients who do not receive ER treatment often find that the facility fee is the only charge on their bill. ""Excessive and unrealistic""I asked Ryan Stanton, an emergency room doctor in Kentucky, to help me review Pell's bill — the $5,571 charge for the triage with an Ace bandage and an ice pack.Generally, Stanton argues that physicians should get paid something for triaging patients because it's a valuable service in its own right. ""I think there needs to be a fee because there is work done, there is responsibility taken by the provider,"" he said. He noted that in Kentucky, for example, the state Medicaid program typically pays a $50 fee for triaging its patients in the emergency room. I described to Stanton the bill that Pell received for her triage experience. He said that it seemed ""excessive and unrealistic.""""I don't know why there would be a $5,000 charge for this,"" he continued. ""That certainly seems like a lot.""Pell's health insurance plan, Cigna, estimated that Medicare would pay $129.15 for the type of service she received — meaning that CarePoint was charging 4,453 percent of the price allowed by the government-run program.Stanton said hospitals will often inflate their bills because they expect that insurance companies will not pay the entire charge. But tracking down the information about what a facility fee or triage will cost at your local hospital is incredibly difficult for patients, often impossible.""If you call and ask, they are not going to tell you. Right now there are not a lot of great tools and there aren't great databases,"" Stanton says. ""That's a real shortfall for our patients.""Insurance paid $862 for a triage visit — but the hospital says that isn't enoughPell's insurance company, Cigna, contracted with a third party called Viant to determine a ""reasonable and appropriate"" fee for the visit. It landed on $862 as a fair price for the visit, and Cigna paid that to Hoboken University Medical Center in October 2016.Viant warned Pell in a letter last fall that ""some hospitals will not automatically reduce their bills, however, and may bill you for those amounts above the reasonable and appropriate amounts.""Pell initially thought she was in the clear when a year went by and she heard nothing from Hoboken University Medical Center. But on December 31, 2017, she received a bill for $4,989 — the remaining amount beyond what her insurer had determined to be reasonable. Pell wrote to CarePoint to appeal that bill in January, describing the content of her visit. Jessica Pell protested her emergency room bill, writing the hospital a letter questioning the charges. She says that during her visit, she ""received an icepack and ace bandage and left to seek in-network medical assistance."" Jennifer Brown for Vox ""I was triaged, waited and taken to have myself examined,"" she wrote in the letter. ""I specifically asked on multiple occasions, before anyone touched me, 'are you out of network? If you are, I decline medical attention.' I received an icepack and ace bandage and left to seek in-network medical assistance.""But new copies of that same bill continued to come after that letter, including a bill dated January 29 that reiterated the amount she owes the hospital, and again on February 28.After I began reporting this story, however, the hospital reached out to Pell and said it would zero out her bill, as well as refund the $100 copayment she made at the time of the visit. Looking back, Pell isn't able to see any way she could have actually avoided the surprise bill she was hoping to dodge by seeking in-network treatment.""I wouldn't have done anything differently. I would have done it exactly the same,"" she says. ""I followed my instincts, and they were all correct. There is no way for me to have known. There was no way to avoid this.""Help us report on the costs to visit the emergency room. Share your bill here.",https://t.co/OU0pVlWj93,news
"Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software Defined Radios","Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software DefinedÂ RadiosReverse Engineering an Insulin Pump for DIY Closed Loop TherapyRoughly 3 years ago, I heard about a website offering a bounty for something that was very close to my heart: reverse engineering communications to an insulin pump. My daughter was already using a system that I had helped to create called Loop, with a Medtronic pump that I had reverse engineered the RF comms forÂ¹. But the Medtronic pump required her to disconnect during her gymnastics for hours at a time. The tubeless design of this Omnipod pump sounded great, and I had all the tools to start working on the problem.The Omnipod system consists of a small disposable pump called a pod, and a controlling unit called a PDM.Because the PDM communicates with the pod using radio and the pod has no built in interface, it means the pod is entirely controllable over the radio. There was the potential to create a full integration with Loop using just a RileyLink, or a modified version of it.James Wedding had put up the bounty, and it attracted a lot of attention, and ultimately the right people who would be needed to make progress.Software DefinedÂ RadioSDRs are awesome tools; they make the hidden world of radio visible. There are all kinds of messages zipping by all the time, and these tools let you poke around, see the messages, and with some work, start decoding the little blips you see there. If you're looking for messages from a specific device, you need to know what general area to start looking in. That's where the FCC public filings come in handy.The FCC filing for the PDM, RBV-019, shows that the device transmits in the 433MHz range. Configuring the SDR software to listen in the 433MHz range while issuing a status from the PDM shows comms like this:As I eventually learned, those two bright lines are indicative of a certain type of modulation called frequency shift keying, or FSK. This means that the frequency of the signal varies with the information being transmitted. A 1 bit is sent as a higher frequency (the top line) and a 0 bit is sent with a slightly lower frequency (the bottom line). And using the tool inspectrum we can have it analyze the data to more clearly show the 1's and 0's. Here's a very zoomed in view of that first message above:I ended up writing a python script to extract these bits so we could look at them as a whole packet.It turns out this repeating pattern was part of the preamble. To conserve energy, receivers often have a pattern of sleeping, and waking up periodically to check for a signal. The transmitter sends a preamble long enough to catch the receiver during one of the short listening periods. When the receiver hears the preamble, it stays awake until the real data shows up.There was one more layer we had to get through before we were looking at actual packet data. You can't send your data over the radio exactly as the original bits, because the receiver uses the transitions to synchronize in time when to expect the next bit. If you have a long set of 1's or 0's, the receiver could get out of sync. So radio communications usually use an encoding to make sure there are enough transitions. The Omnipod communications use an encoding called Manchester encoding. Each bit is encoded by two bits. A 1 bit is encoded as 10, and a 0 bit is encoded as 01.This all took a lot of hashing out and there were a lot of theories shared in the openomni slack, as we tried to make getting the raw bits repeatable. Mark Brighton, Dan Caron, and @larsonlr, had been having some success with using RFCat and a TI Stick to capture packets. Evariste Courjaud would eventually write a tool called rtlomni used an rtl-sdr stick to listen for packets and decode them that would prove to be very convenient and more reliable than the TI-Stick based methods.Decoding PacketsOnce we had the actual bits of the packet, we started to look into packet structure. Based on what bits were changing between different pods, and different commands, we pieced together an understanding that looked like this.CRC8Radio is a far from perfect transmission medium. There are many different sources of interference that can make the receiver hear a 1 when a 0 was sent, and vice versa. It's important to know when this has happened, so most protocols use a checksum of sorts, often something called a CRC. The receiver computes the CRC as it receives the data, and the last byte of the packet includes the CRC as the transmitter computed it. If they don't match, the receiver throws the packet away and waits for a retransmission.The Omnipod protocol used a standard 8-bit CRC, so when we found this, we thought we were really close to having the messages figured out. Little did we know…Messages, CRC16Some messages are too big to fit into a single packet, so they are sent as multiple packets. We started to piece together the format of messages, and noticed another set of bits at the end of each message that looked like a 16-bit crc. But it was weird; 5 of the 16 bits were never set. We tried many different techniques to figure out how this was being set, but nothing worked.This was the first big blocker; we could proceed to work out what the other bits in the messages were, but it would be little help to understand what was being sent, but not be able to generate new packets ourselves, and so progress slowed down.Months passed with little progress, and finally in winter of 2016 a member of the group with the handle @lorelai posted that she had sucessfully dumped the firmware from the larger ARM-based chip on the PDM, and started the tedious process of disassembly: taking cpu instructions and turning them into human understandable code with semantic variable and function names. She did an amazing job figuring out what various methods were involved in sending data over the radio.I was looking at one of the unnamed routines, and noticed it looked like a standard implementation of a table based CRC calculation. And the table had the values for a standard 16 bit CRC. I wrote my own implementation using the table, and it checked out like a normal CRC. Then I looked closely at how the function was written. A normal CRC implementation looks like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &lt;&lt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Theirs looked like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Spot the difference? What should've been a bitwise left shift operator had somehow been coded as a right shift. This is a bug; there is no reason to cripple your own CRC algorithm, as it makes it less likely to catch corrupted messages.We were up and running again! We started working on decoding messages, recording sessions from the PDM for delivering boluses, temp basals, suspends, etc…NonceAll of the insulin delivery commands had a 4-byte chunk of data near the beginning of the message that looked like it might be some form of cryptography. Again, we tried many different ways of interpreting it, and analyzing it in the context of the messages it was sent in, but it wasn't a crc (we'd see the same 4 bytes on occasion even when the message data was different). And sometimes we'd see the pattern repeat. It looked maybe this was a bit of the protocol designed to prevent replay of data. Other protocols had features like this, called a nonce.One possible route we had considered was to record a database of messages to replay for given commands. Even if the address of each pod was different, now that we knew how to generate the message crc, we could take a copy of the command we had seen before, put a new address on the message, and recompute the crc. Except this nonce was preventing us from using that strategy. For the next insulin delivery command, no matter what command was sent, the pod would only accept the next nonce in the sequence, and we didn't know how to generate the next nonce.But hey! We have the decompiled PDM firmware now, we can just look there! So we pored over the PDM firmware, and tracked down the message generation in the code, and found where those four bytes should be. But instead of a method computing some cryptographic Nonce, we just found the four characters ""INS.. WTF?!?! Ok, somehow this area of the message must be being updated later in the pipeline.There was another chip on the PDM, closer to the radio. It was the same chip that was used in the Pods, a chip with an identifier of SC9S08ER48, something that wasn't documented online, and was likely produced custom for Insulet. Maybe we could get the firmware off of that chip. Unfortunately, that chip was locked, which prevented dumping of firmware.Again, progress slowed… This felt like a real dead end. We had thrown all our smarts at this nonce, and didn't have any good leads on the math that was behind it. And the ER48 that (possibly) held the secrets was locked and it was hard to find any public details that might help us crack it.X-Ray imagesIn trying to understand more about the ER48, some members of the slack community offered to try to get Xray images, which was really cool, but unfortunately didn't open up any new avenues.Overview XrayDetail XrayDecapping andÂ ImagingDan Caron decided to reach out to a researcher, Dr. Sergei Skorobogatov, at the University of Cambridge in the UK that he had read about who had experience in extracting code from locked chips, and convinced him to take a look at our problem. Dr. Skorobogatov had led research in using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) for chip reverse engineering and suggested it might be possible, but would be expensive, needing access to expensive equipment, and not guaranteed. Joe Moran, who had recently started using Loop after we met at the Fall 2016 Nightscout Hackathon dove in to helping out with this project, and arranged with a bay area company, Nanolab Technologies, to perform the decapping and imaging of the chips, and also graciously funded Nanolab and Dr Skorobogatov's work (and also his personal boxes of pods).Dr. Skorobogatov had Nanolab perform a variety of imaging techniques to ascertain if the protection could be defeated with known non-invasive or semi-invasive methods. This resulted in a lot of images, some of them very beautiful. These are optical microscope pictures of the silicon die.Optical microscope dieÂ overviewOptical microscope dieÂ overviewThere were also images taken of specific areas of the die using scanning electron microscopy. Attempts were made with different voltages, different surface preparations, and different equipment.SEM Image of flash memory cells. Not resolving data.Unfortunately, none of these produced images capable of resolving the actual contents of the flash.Dr. Skorobogatov had one last resort method that was only to be used if these other techniques failed. It was a proprietary method that would have to be given the blessing to be used by the University. Dr. Skorobogatov did an initial test and confirmed that it was capable of resolving the data on this chip. But before we could proceed an NDA had to be agreed upon and so negotiations about who was to be the recipient of the extracted firmware were undertaken.The Nightscout foundation would ultimately be the party signing the NDA and would take the responsibility to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the methods and results of the extraction.The result of this arrangement and work was an incredible paper written by Dr Sergei Skorobogatov, and the raw firmware data. The initial extraction of the firmware had a significant number of errors, but was enough to get started on. Joe asked at the spring Nightscout Foundation Hack if anyone would be up for digging into the disassembly. Nobody raised their hands. Turning the cpu instructions into something understandable is painstaking work, and there are very few people who know how to do it. I tried digging into it, using cpu instruction documentation, but made very little progress, and grew frustrated. Others optimistically asked for request to the firmware with big expectations of fast progress, and then realized the scope and challenge of the task and quietly dropped off.Example disassembly of SC908 instructionsIt turns out Joe also has an extensive background working at the assembly level, and started taking on the onerous task himself. In July, Dr. Skorobogatov had completed a second extraction with much fewer errors. Over the summer Joe Moran worked tirelessly on mapping out the huge amount of cpu instructions, and slowly fitting them together into a larger picture of pod pseudocode.Eventually, Ken Shirriff, an expert in hardware reverse engineering, would join the effort and sped up the process considerably. Together, Joe and Ken eventually mapped out enough code to find the function responsible for coding the nonce September of 2017.RileyLink andÂ LoopWe had been updating the openomni python scripts with our understanding of the comms, but now it was time to start focusing on RileyLink + iOS, so I started work on OmniKit, and firmware updates for the RileyLink. I believed we had the fundamentals of the protocol worked out, and the rest was just details. Again, completely underestimating how much more was ahead of us.I had to write new firmware that would handle the pod modulation and encoding. I also had to rewrite the way the two chips on the RL talked to each other to handle 0's, as 0 was a special end of packet marker for Medtronic. Much in Loop needed to be reworked to support multiple Pumps, and new interfaces made to support pairing, deactivating, and handling faults. Thankfully Nate Racklyeft had set a solid foundation in Loop for this to happen.Meanwhile, work on understanding the format of the commands continued and was documented thoroughly on the openomni wiki, which is the most comprehensive documentation on the pod protocol published publicly. Joe, Evariste, and Eelke Jager really did a massive amount of work decoding messages, and updating the pages over time. Various members of the slack channel have contributed captures of PDM to Pod communications to aid decoding efforts.The decoding was fun work, with lots of small wins as each component of each command is deciphered, and I really enjoyed working on this part, and adding code to Loop to implement. In April of 2018 I shared on slack that I had ""paired via iPhone + RL, primed, cannula insertion, basal schedule programmed, and then bolused 5U.The 2.0 RL firmware was finished in July of 2018, and new shipments started including it. It was hoped that these boards would be able to be used with Loop and Omnipod, but the existing 915 MHz antenna would prove to be too poor to do 433 MHz comms effectively.Decoding and implementation was progressed well over the summer, and the Loop experience was coming together. Joe did an amazing thing in providing funding for me to quit my day job, and focus more on this project, and to eventually join the wonderful Tidepool team. There were of course more events happening outside of the omnipod RE story in the DIY and regulator spaces that I won't cover, but it was a very interesting summer!ScreamersAs more functionality came online in the driver, I started hooking it up into Loop, including the ability to automatically adjust delivery by temp basals. At this point it was fairly common to get a screaming pod, which meant some of the pod's internal checking had detected a situation where it decided there was a problem and it should not continue to deliver insulin.But it seemed like a workable problem, as we continued to find small discrepancies in what Loop was sending versus what the PDM would send if the command was delivered manually, and I assumed if we fixed all of those that the screaming would stop.Looping!On October 3, 2018, Joe put a Loop controlled pod on himself and became the first Loop Omnipod user, but didn't tell me immediately as he knew I'd be worrying. When he did tell me, I still worried. We had seen the pod work, and understood the functionality, and the basic algorithm of Loop had been vetted for a long time, but still…A month later, at the November 2018 Nightscout Hackathon, a few more adventurous souls opted try it out for themselves as well, and became part of a small private testing group that would grow to over 30 people before the branch was made public.Unfortunately, we still had screamers often happening before the full 3 days of use were finished, and we had meticulously compared Loop's commands to PDM reference versions. Eelke was particularly helpful with this process, creating a script that could check commands against their reference versions automatically. I started to get worried that the increased demands on the battery for doing communication every five minutes had pushed the pod over the edge of what was sustainable.Pod voltage taps, drilled through back plastic, super-glued inÂ place.So I started measuring pod voltage with an arduino, recording the data and storing it a local database for visualization. Comparing PDM and Loop.Long time scale view of podÂ voltage.Unfortunately, this proved to be a dead end as well; using a PDM and bolusing large amounts, I could drive the pod to lower voltages than even Loop would do over the life of a looping pod, and wasn't able to make the pod scream. It seemed like voltage wasn't the issue, so there must be something else.RileyLinks with 955 MHz (left) and coil 433 MHz (right)Â antennasAt one point I noticed that if a message exchange with the pod failed, the pod would sometimes be left in a state of trying to complete the exchange by re-sending packets over and over and over. Testers logs were also showing lots of failures, and so I started experimenting with antennas. Both of these problems should be improved with better comms. I had planned on trying different antennas and had ordered from random places on the internet, but hadn't had time to try them until it became a priority.I had some flexible 433 MHz antennas that could be taped on the inside of the RL case. These would often have great performance in some scenarios, but not in others; it was too unreliable. When I got to the coil based one, it had good performance very consistently, and at very surprising ranges. Time for a new RileyLink case.With the new antenna, and some optimizations to do fewer message exchanges while still allowing adjustments every 5 minutes, the frequency of screamers went down to a very low rate. Likely comparable to using a pod normally with a PDM. In the most recent 7,500 hours of live testing, 94% of pods completed without faults.Testing and DocumentationThe testing group grew slowly, which was a great way to continually get new eyes on the system and see what parts were confusing. These testers put up with a lot of screaming pods, and contributed in very big ways to making Loop with Omnipod work better. They did this primarily by sharing issue reports from each of their pods, whether successful or not.The issue reports have a message log in them that could be analyzed by the tool that Eelke built, giving us insight into whether we had any misformatted commands and also let us gather statistics around certain parts of Loop's interaction with the pods.Marion Barker joined the testing group and added dedicated reporting, and additional statistics to the progress of testing, and we were able to use her stats of successful pods vs failures to have a high level view of progress.Eventually Katie DiSimone joined the testing group, and started a large restructuring of loopdocs.org to provide documentation for using Loop with multiple devices. The anticipation around a version of Loop that worked with Omnipod was incredibly high, and without good documentation, it was certain that we'd be flooded with the same questions over and over.New Features ForÂ LoopOmnipod integration required rethinking of some interface elements, and adding new controls. The pod doesn't report battery, and there is little a user can do about a low battery if one were to somehow happen, so displaying a battery level widget didn't make sense. Also, without a UI on the pump, the user needs to be able to cancel a bolus quickly. The reservoir icon was a picture of a Medtronic reservoir, so we wanted to rethink that. Thank you to Paul Forgione for designing the pod logo that now shows reservoir level.ThanksThank you to all the people who help make this long road come to a place where we can share this with others, and realize the goal that we set out to do a long time ago. I know I didn't cover everyone, and everything that happened. That would be impossible in a single post, and for me, since I only have my experience through this. It's hard to imagine the total hours put into this. If you could add them all up, I'm sure it would be shocking. Not to mention the work that has gone into making the Omnipod itself, which I imagine dwarfs this effort. So thank you *all*. Also, many of those hours would otherwise have been spent with families. I really appreciate my wife and kids being understanding with the time I've spent on this, and want to thank them too.SidenotesI have to mention Joakim Ornstedt, as one of the contributors to openomni decoding, and also the creator of what is probably actually the first looping integration with omnipod. He built a device that used optical character recognition (OCR) on the PDM to get data from the PDM, and wired in digital button presses to the PDM through another microcontroller. It's a hard to scale approach, but very clever, and bypasses a lot of the issues we had to deal with for an RE based solution. I really admired him for pulling this off, and getting looping in a tiny fraction of the time it took to make it work with Loop.",https://t.co/ZkS8wUF4p8,news
'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/y0HdgtJOW5,news

Diabetics struggle as drug prices soar,"Struggling to stay alive: Rising insulin prices cause diabetics to go to extremes The escalating cost of insulin has desperate diabetics rationing medication, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from Canada or Mexico. Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY Corrections &amp; Clarifications: This story has been updated to reflect royalty payments for a 1923 patent.Meaghan Carter died alone on the sofa of her suburban Dayton, Ohio, apartment last Christmas.Like most people with Type 1 diabetes, the 47-year-old nurse had a kit of essential supplies within reach. It contained two empty vials of her preferred insulin, a partial vial of inexpensive Walmart insulin and a half-filled container of testing strips to measure blood glucose levels.Uninsured, between jobs and with $50 in a bank account, Carter probably had attempted to stretch a limited supply of insulin until she got a final paycheck from her last job, family members say. She was scheduled to begin a new nursing job the following week that offered health insurance.""There was no insulin at all in the refrigerator,"" says Mindi Patterson, Carter's sister-in-law. ""She had gauze, bandages and all her nursing supplies. She had plenty to take care of others but not enough to take care of herself."" She buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive in the US Deidre Waxman buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive for her on MedicareErin Clark and Jasper Colt, USA TODAYThe cost of insulin for diabetics such as Carter has drawn national scrutiny as Congress examines factors contributing to the nation's escalating prescription drug prices. All people with Type 1 and some with Type 2 diabetes need the drug, but regular price hikes make insulin difficult to afford for the uninsured and those whose coverage requires significant cost sharing.Patient advocates are becoming increasingly vocal about the affordability of a drug invented nearly a century ago by scientists who took steps to make the medicine inexpensive. One group staged protests outside the offices of the nation's three dominant insulin makers.Canadian scientists discovered insulin in 1921, treated the first diabetic patient in 1922 and sold the patent to the University of Toronto for 3 Canadian dollars. The university administered the patent and received royalty payments from drug companies that sold human insulin.The price of modern versions of a drug that more than 7 million Americans need to live nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013, according to one study. Type 1 diabetics paid an average of $5,705 for insulin in 2016 – nearly double what they paid in 2012, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.Diedre Waxman lives in Newton, Mass., and has Type 1 diabetes. Diagnosed six years ago, Waxman has adopted a strict diet, so she doesn't need as much insulin, which she purchases from Canada.Erin Clark for USA TODAYPatient advocates say people have resorted to extreme measures such as taking less than the doctor prescribed to make it last longer, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from less expensive pharmacies in Canada or Mexico.More: Lack of insulin could affect 40 million people with diabetes by 2030, study findsLast month, the powerful Senate Finance Committee asked the three dominant insulin makers detailed questions about the drugs' price increases. The price for one vial of Eli Lilly's Humalog surged from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015. From 2013 to this year, Novo Nordisk's Novolog jumped from $289 to $540 and Sanofi's Lantus from $244 to $431, according to a committee letter.A vial of insulin loses potency after being opened for 28 days. The amount of insulin a patient needs varies depending on such factors as age, weight, diet and overall health.Among things senators want to know: How do drugmakers set insulin prices, and what's the role of rebates and discounts to middlemen pharmacy benefit managers?Senators are not limiting questions to Big Pharma. The nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, who drew scrutiny for their increasingly powerful role as middlemen in the drug supply chain, will appear before the committee April 3.Drugmakers say they've taken steps to address prices, offered co-pay cards to limit out-of-pocket expenses and funded patient-assistance programs that provide free medication to thousands of vulnerable Americans.Sanofi pledged to limit annual price increases to less than the average health spending rate.This month, Eli Lilly unveiled a half-price version of Humalog called insulin lispro for $137.50 for a single vial. It's the same drug as Humalog, only with a different label.In a statement, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the lower-cost insulin is a ""bridge that addresses gaps in the system until a more sustainable model is achieved.""Simeon Taylor, a University of Maryland School of Medicine diabetes researcher, says Type 1 diabetics without adequate insurance coverage are vulnerable to price increases because they can't live without the drug.""Insulin is not an optional medication,"" says Taylor, who formerly worked for Eli Lilly and the National Institutes of Health. ""People have to buy insulin no matter what the cost is. That gives a lot of strength to the people selling insulin.""'Whole system needs to be evaluated'Some suggest that a simple across-the-board price cut might not work for all patients under the system.The American Diabetes Association convened an Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group to study rising insulin prices and affordability of the life-sustaining medicine. The group's study concluded that a complex supply chain from the drug factory to the pharmacy might promote higher prices.Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers, demand rebates from drug manufacturers. Their leverage: placing the drug on an insurer's formulary – the list of drugs that the insurance company will cover for insured consumers.A drugmaker that offers a lower rebate might be excluded from a prescription drug plan or be placed on a less favorable tier that requires consumers to pay a larger portion on the tab.More: Insulin costs nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, report saysThe ADA's working group's report found that even though drugmakers' ""list prices"" for insulin have surged, their ""net prices"" have grown at a more modest rate. The list price is how much the drugmaker charges. The net price is money the drugmaker gets after fees, discounts and rebates to wholesalers or pharmacy benefit managers.Consumers are not privy to these behind-the-scenes negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers and drug manufacturers. All of this is done outside the public's view.""A lot of attention has focused on the manufacturers and less on the other players in the supply chain,"" says Karen Van Nuys, a research professor at USC's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and member of the ADA's working group. ""We think those players also share responsibility for what happens to prices and access.""Van Nuys says that if one drugmaker lowers insulin prices, that could put it at a competitive disadvantage compared with peers. That is because pharmacy benefit managers might still require a significant rebate.Novo Nordisk says its insulin net prices declined at double-digit rates in 2017 and 2018 because of rebate demands.""The whole system needs to be evaluated,"" Van Nuys says.Study: Cost affects insulin useNewton, Massachusetts, resident Deidre Waxman has good prescription-drug coverage through Medicare.But she worries that the $1,300 to $1,500 monthly retail cost of her insulin will be unaffordable if she reaches the doughnut hole, Medicare's deductible that kicks in once drug spending exceeds $3,820.She does not fill insulin prescriptions at her neighborhood pharmacy; she gets her medicine from Canada. Her husband buys insulin during his frequent work trips there, and she will take a six-hour car trip to Canada once a year to get insulin. A third source is Mark's Marine, a Vancouver, British Columbia, pharmacy that ships to U.S. patients.Waxman does not need much insulin because she is on a low-carbohydrate diet. If she has excess insulin, she packs it in styrofoam containers cooled with ice packs and sends it to fellow diabetes patients who can't afford the drug.""I send it to friends who are in dire need,"" Waxman says. ""These are people who would die without insulin.""Diedre Waxman's diabetes bag includes the pen she loads with cartridges to administer her insulin.Erin Clark for USA TODAYFor those without robust insurance coverage, there are signs they are having difficulty affording insulin.Kasia Lipska is an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. Lipska noticed that more Yale Diabetes Center patients seemed to struggle to pay for insulin, so doctors surveyed patients about whether cost influenced their insulin use.One in four patients responded that cost prompted them to use less insulin than prescribed, take smaller doses, stretch out supplies, not fill a prescription or not start the drug. It was a small study at one center in Connecticut, and researchers can't be certain whether insulin affordability is better or worse in other states.People who struggle to pay are ""more in the middle,"" Lipska says. They don't qualify for Medicaid, the state insurance plan for low-income residents, and some earn too much to qualify for patient-assistance programs.A person with Type 1 diabetes who discontinues the drug might get sick, hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis or die, she says.More: Eli Lilly to introduce generic version of insulin drug Humalog that cuts price in halfThe health problems of diabetics who take less than they need might take longer to detect but can be just as serious.Taking less insulin than prescribed can lead to serious health harms, Lipska says. Those could include a diabetic ulcer, a foot infection that leads to amputation or kidney damage.""We know it's a problem,"" Lipska says. ""The problem leads to, in very severe cases, patients dying, people having complications, people being admitted to the hospital.""'You realize you don't have any left'Blind in one eye and her vision rapidly deteriorating in the other, Sarah Theubet could not afford the medicine her body needed to slow the harmful effects of diabetes.Insulin was too expensive. The uninsured Redding, California, resident could not afford the cost of a drug that had more than tripled since the early 2000s.""It was terrifying,"" Theubet says. ""You are looking at the vial, and you realize you don't have any left.""Theubet turned to friends she met through social media in 2016 and 2017 to solicit insulin donations while she drastically changed her diet so she would not need as much medicine.She ate one low-carbohydrate meal each day that rarely varied: sliced lunch meat and cheese, no bread.She barely had enough energy to make it through classes at Shasta Community College. Vision in her right eye, stabilized this decade from an operation, began to worsen because she could not afford to take insulin as prescribed. She is blind in her left eye.""With the rationing, that was the first year my ophthalmologist noticed a (vision) decline because I was all over the place,"" Theubet says of her insulin use.More: Soaring insulin prices prompt insurance shiftSarah Theubet, 38, has Type 1 diabetes that robbed her of her vision in one eye and will eventually render her blind.Michael Chapman, Redding Record Searchlight via USA TODAY NETWORKBecause she is legally blind, she qualified for Social Security disability in 2017, which includes health insurance through Medicare. She now gets the insulin she needs.Now that her health coverage and access to insulin are stable, she has thrived in the classroom. She will complete her general education studies in the fall and plans to transfer to the University of California-Davis to complete her communication degree.She wants to advocate for the disabled.""I am doing the best I can with what I've been given,"" Theubet says.'Symptom of dysfunctional' systemSome say government needs to step in because the private sector has failed to check price increases.Taylor, a member of the ADA working group, says insulin pricing is emblematic of the nation's health system flaws.Pharmacy benefit managers started to counter pharmaceutical industry's pricing power. As these middlemen gained more clout, they began to demand higher rebates. Drug companies raised prices by amounts that are slightly less than what pharmacy benefit managers demanded.""This is a symptom of a dysfunctional health care system in the United States,"" Taylor says. ""I don't want to put all the blame on the companies. From my point of view, the responsibility is in how our health care system is designed.""More: Big Pharma CEOs tell senators they won't reduce drug costs without other changesCarter, the Dayton-area resident, was hospitalized twice for complications this decade and struggled to afford insulin months before she died, Patterson says.She spent $25 to buy Novolin NPH insulin from Walmart on Dec. 20, according to a receipt the family retrieved from her apartment after her death. Novolin is an older version of human insulin that must be adjusted based on regular blood and glucose testing.""I told her it was pretty unpredictable,"" Patterson says of Novolin. ""You only use it if you have no other option.""Carter was struggling on Christmas Day, feeling nauseous and slurring her words, a roommate told Huber Heights police.The roommate told police she thought Carter's blood-sugar levels were off and urged her to call a doctor or a paramedic.Carter refused, and the roommate left for work. When the roommate returned from work that night, she noticed Carter appeared to be sleeping on the sofa. The following morning, the roommate checked on Carter and realized she had died. The Montgomery County Coroner determined Carter died on Christmas night, but the agency did not consider the death suspicious and did not perform an autopsy. Carter often did not take her insulin as directed, the roommate told police. A family doctor signed her death certificate, listing the cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest.Patterson, whose husband and two sons have Type 1 diabetes, is convinced her sister-in-law experienced a type of complication called diabetic ketoacidosis before she died.She says she desperately wants to see a reformed system so patients can afford the medication they need to live.""The system is broken,"" Patterson says.

Sacha Inchi Shown to Improve Insulin Resistance,"Glucose regulation is a complex process that depends on many variables, such as meal time, amount, and type of food you ingest. Some people experience problems processing glucose, which is known as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and leads to blood sugar spikes after heavy meals, whereas type 2 diabetes patients have a chronic condition where insulin simply cannot be generated in adequate amounts, creating an imbalance.Sacha Inchi, packed with protein and healthy fats, has made its way into the nuts' world as a superfood; however, a promising study suggests that the increasingly famous Incas' peanut can also be of help improving insulin resistance after fatty meals.The StudyThis double blind randomized trial was realized in Colombia, where researchers from three different universities (San Buenaventura University, Pontificia Javeriana University, and Icesi University) joined forces in order to analyze the effects of Sacha inchi oil on glucose metabolism after the ingestion of meals rich in saturated fat. The results of the study were published in the scientific journal Food &amp; Function.During the trial, 42 adult men were randomly given two meals rich in saturated fat for breakfast, one of them enriched with 15 mL of sacha inchi oil. Blood samples were obtained one hour before the meals, as well as four hours after, in order to register changes in the levels of glucose, insulin, and lipids in all the participants.The ResultsThe addition of sacha inchi oil slowed down glucose production in 16 (38.1%) participants that showed a higher concentration of triglycerides before meals (fasting hypertriglyceridemia), whereas an improved expression of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a gene responsible for regulating energy within the cells and coordinating cellular functions, was registered four hours after ingesting the meal enriched with sacha inchi oil, and linked to lowered levels of blood sugar measured at the same time.What Does this Mean?Enriching fatty meals with sacha inchi oil can improve insulin sensitivity in people with high levels of triglycerides, as well as in those who experience blood sugar spikes after consuming fatty food. However, far from encouraging people to consume unhealthy fats, this promising outcome may result in new therapeutic uses of Incas' peanut for the treatment of both hypertriglyceridemia and type 2 diabetes, as well as in new ways of preventing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.",https://t.co/c2cd0YFeR1,news
Pfizer CEO gets 61% pay raise-to $27.9 million-as drug prices continue to climb,"Enlarge / Ian Read, chairman and CEO of Pfizer Inc. spoke with President Trump last July about pausing drug price hikes. Pfizer now plans to increase prices of 41 of its drugs later this month. As drug giant Pfizer Inc. hiked the price of dozens of drugs in 2017, it also jacked up the compensation of CEO Ian Read by 61 percent, putting his total compensation at $27.9 million, according to financial filings reported by Bloomberg.Pfizer's board reportedly approved the compensation boost because they saw it as a ""compelling incentive"" to keep Read from retiring. He turns 65 in May. As part of the deal, Read has to stay on through at least next March and is barred from working with a competitor for a minimum of two years after that.According to Bloomberg, Read's compensation included in part a salary of $1.96 million, a $2.6 million bonus, $13.1 million in equity awards linked to financial goals and stock price, as well as an $8 million special equity award that will vest if the company's average stock return goes above 25 percent for 30 consecutive trading days before the end of 2022.In 2016, Read's compensation totaled $17.3 million.The 61 percent raise comes after a string of separate reports noting drug price increases by Pfizer. In January, FiercePharma reported an analysis finding that Pfizer implemented 116 price hikes just between this past December 15 and January 3 of this year. The list price increases ranged from 3 percent to 9.46 percent. The analysts noted that Pfizer increased the price of 20 drugs by 9.44 percent. Those included Viagra, Pristiq, Lipitor, and Zoloft, which are available as generics, as well as Chantix.Additionally, Pfizer had increased the prices of 91 drugs by an average of 20 percent in just the first half of 2017, according to data first reported by Financial Times. That included two waves of price hikes, one in January and the other on June 1.That echoes the pattern seen in 2016, 2015, and 2014, according to a report by STAT. In June of 2016, Pfizer raised the list prices of its medicines by an average of 8.8 percent. That followed an average 10.4 percent raise in list prices in January of that year.In response to the price hikes reported earlier this year, a Pfizer spokesperson told FiercePharma that the company ""takes a measured and responsible approach to pricing."" The spokesperson added that Pfizer provides assistance programs to some eligible patients with financial hardships. However, such discount and assistance programs don't spare insurance companies from picking up larger tabs, which contributes to higher premiums and system-wide costs.Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Ars.The price hikes come amid a national outrage over the high prices of medications and healthcare overall. A recent analysis published in JAMA compared healthcare spending in the US to 10 other high-income countries. It found that the US paid nearly twice as much but performed less well. The main drivers of higher prices, researchers found, were high administrative costs and devices and pricy medicines.",https://t.co/U1du8nQ9Nd,news
What's New In Diabetes Management? Focus On The Individual!,"Finally! Healthcare providers are shifting the focus of care to the needs of patients as individuals. This is a monumental change from the mindset of ""Every patient with ABC is treated with the XYZ plan of care.""Instead of automatically assigning you the same diet, medication and exercise plan as every other diabetic patient, emphasis is placed on what works for you as the individual. In recent years, patients have not been allowed, let alone encouraged to be directly involved in developing their own plans of care. Times are changing, and diabetics have to take advantage.Educate &amp; Empower YourselfWhen it comes to managing diabetes, knowledge is power. The more information you have, the better decisions you can make. Work with your healthcare team to develop a realistic plan of care for your high blood sugar. If your physician prescribes medication, take it as directed. While lifestyle changes are the key to reversing diabetes and achieving your best health long-term, prescription medications can help bring blood sugar to a level that is actually manageable.FoodFood is life… literally! This may be the most difficult shift in lifestyle when working with your healthcare team. Food is personal, even emotional for many people. Food cultures and traditions are deeply ingrained in us, and can be incredibly impactful to our happiness.Even if a certain food makes us happy, some things that just aren't good for the body. Any other French fry lovers out there? However, that doesn't mean that a healthful diet can't be delicious and satisfying. How about a little change in perspective?Start by taking a closer look at the opinions and feelings you attach to certain foods. For example, do you think of a doughnut as an evil enemy sent to tempt and destroy you? Do you picture good health when you see an apple?Resist labeling foods as good or bad. This gives food too much power and influence over your thoughts. It is true that some foods are better for your body (and blood sugar) than others, but no single food determines your overall health or well-being. When you cook and eat real, quality foods it becomes obvious that nutritious can be delicious. Avocados, berries, even olive oil and garlic are just a few foods that pack a powerful punch!Avocados have a positive impact on insulin levels. Monounsaturated fats help boost insulin function, and aid in keeping blood sugar lower and more stable. An avocado is a great source of fiber, which helps to regulate blood sugar, as well.Loaded with fiber and antioxidants, raspberries and blackberries top the list with more than 7 grams of fiber per cup. Blueberries are also a great source of vitamins and soluble fiber. Studies have found that glucose levels reduce over time when blueberries are included in one's diet.The world has been enjoying the health benefits of olives and olive oil for thousands of years. Those benefits are due to healthy fats, phytonutrients, as well as, a variety of vitamins and antioxidants. A team of Virginia Tech researchers discovered that the compound oleuropein found in olives encourages the body to secrete more insulin, helping to reduce blood sugar and better control diabetes!Garlic has been revered as a contributor to better health for centuries. Research is starting to suggest that it may even show promise for lowering blood sugar. A 2005 study which administered garlic orally to diabetic rats recorded significant decreases in blood glucose. Researchers also found that garlic can lower total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and increase insulin production.Work with your healthcare team to develop a meal plan to include the right combination of healthy fats, fiber, and protein. Talk about the foods you love and the foods you don't. Find countless recipes online and find creative ways to adapt them to your taste. Bottom line: if you don't like it, you won't eat it. Figure out what tastes best to you!ExerciseRegular physical activity contributes nearly countless positive effects on your health, especially for those with diabetes. It helps your body make the best use of insulin and glucose, which controls blood sugar more effectively. In fact, exercise can reduce blood sugar levels for up to 24 hours after working out.Regular physical activity also lowers blood pressure, improves circulation, and helps control cholesterol levels, thereby reducing risk of heart attack and stroke. Exercise also helps to strengthen muscles and bones, along with burning extra body fat. It's a great way to boost energy levels and reduce stress, too!While many Americans fall short of the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity per week, research has shown that even a short walk each day can make a major difference in your health.Talk with your physician about which exercise methods are right for you. Bad knee? Low impact exercises are the way to go. Absolutely love going for a swim? That's a great way to get active! Just like with food, figure out what works best for you.SleepThe body's reaction to lack of sleep can mimic insulin resistance. Insulin resistance occurs due to the cell's inability to utilize insulin. This results in high blood sugar. Quality sleep is essential to a happy and healthy life for everyone, and especially for diabetics.One way to help improve your night's sleep is to form a bedtime routine. Perhaps you enjoy a warm bath each night before bed; add some lavender or chamomile bath oil to relax your muscles and your mind. You may prefer to sleep with a fan in your room for noise and air circulation. Avoid looking at brightly lit screens (television, cell phone) before bed as these devices stimulate your brain and keep you awake.Some people need more sleep than others. Track your sleep and talk with your physician about what you find. Does 6 hours of sleep leave you feeling refreshed or more like a zombie? Do you need 9 hours just to feel more human than bear? Don't skip this step – sleep is key!StressFeeling stressed or anxious? Studies have shown that coming home after a long day and preparing a meal can significantly lower stress and anxiety!How you ask? Your mind becomes occupied with the task at hand – finding a recipe, collecting all of your ingredients from the fridge and pantry, compiling them one by one to create something delicious, then getting to sit down and enjoy your hard work. That ""present"" mindset can be very helpful in reducing anxiety, and cooking meals at home is a great way to get started.Research has also found that just a few minutes of meditation every day alters the pathways in your brain, making you more resilient to stress. This helps to improve not only your mental sense of well-being, but your physical one, as well. Give it a try! Meditation, prayer, or yoga are all great options for decreasing stress and increasing energy.Don't be afraid to talk with your healthcare team about how you're feeling. This endeavor to improve health and blood sugar is a big deal that comes with big emotions. There is absolutely no shame in speaking with your doctor about your stress levels, inability to sleep, frustrations with diet, lack of support from family and friends, etc. The mind and the body are truly connected. One cannot exist or thrive without the health of the other.In conclusion, it's time diabetics take advantage of healthcare's shift in focus. Get involved in your care – ask questions. Be your own advocate in your journey to better health. That journey is comprised of many steps. Some of those steps may be larger, or more uncomfortable than others. However, the destination of lower blood sugar and better health is worth every single step!

"Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software Defined Radios","Insulin Pumps, Decapped chips and Software DefinedÂ RadiosReverse Engineering an Insulin Pump for DIY Closed Loop TherapyRoughly 3 years ago, I heard about a website offering a bounty for something that was very close to my heart: reverse engineering communications to an insulin pump. My daughter was already using a system that I had helped to create called Loop, with a Medtronic pump that I had reverse engineered the RF comms forÂ¹. But the Medtronic pump required her to disconnect during her gymnastics for hours at a time. The tubeless design of this Omnipod pump sounded great, and I had all the tools to start working on the problem.The Omnipod system consists of a small disposable pump called a pod, and a controlling unit called a PDM.Because the PDM communicates with the pod using radio and the pod has no built in interface, it means the pod is entirely controllable over the radio. There was the potential to create a full integration with Loop using just a RileyLink, or a modified version of it.James Wedding had put up the bounty, and it attracted a lot of attention, and ultimately the right people who would be needed to make progress.Software DefinedÂ RadioSDRs are awesome tools; they make the hidden world of radio visible. There are all kinds of messages zipping by all the time, and these tools let you poke around, see the messages, and with some work, start decoding the little blips you see there. If you're looking for messages from a specific device, you need to know what general area to start looking in. That's where the FCC public filings come in handy.The FCC filing for the PDM, RBV-019, shows that the device transmits in the 433MHz range. Configuring the SDR software to listen in the 433MHz range while issuing a status from the PDM shows comms like this:As I eventually learned, those two bright lines are indicative of a certain type of modulation called frequency shift keying, or FSK. This means that the frequency of the signal varies with the information being transmitted. A 1 bit is sent as a higher frequency (the top line) and a 0 bit is sent with a slightly lower frequency (the bottom line). And using the tool inspectrum we can have it analyze the data to more clearly show the 1's and 0's. Here's a very zoomed in view of that first message above:I ended up writing a python script to extract these bits so we could look at them as a whole packet.It turns out this repeating pattern was part of the preamble. To conserve energy, receivers often have a pattern of sleeping, and waking up periodically to check for a signal. The transmitter sends a preamble long enough to catch the receiver during one of the short listening periods. When the receiver hears the preamble, it stays awake until the real data shows up.There was one more layer we had to get through before we were looking at actual packet data. You can't send your data over the radio exactly as the original bits, because the receiver uses the transitions to synchronize in time when to expect the next bit. If you have a long set of 1's or 0's, the receiver could get out of sync. So radio communications usually use an encoding to make sure there are enough transitions. The Omnipod communications use an encoding called Manchester encoding. Each bit is encoded by two bits. A 1 bit is encoded as 10, and a 0 bit is encoded as 01.This all took a lot of hashing out and there were a lot of theories shared in the openomni slack, as we tried to make getting the raw bits repeatable. Mark Brighton, Dan Caron, and @larsonlr, had been having some success with using RFCat and a TI Stick to capture packets. Evariste Courjaud would eventually write a tool called rtlomni used an rtl-sdr stick to listen for packets and decode them that would prove to be very convenient and more reliable than the TI-Stick based methods.Decoding PacketsOnce we had the actual bits of the packet, we started to look into packet structure. Based on what bits were changing between different pods, and different commands, we pieced together an understanding that looked like this.CRC8Radio is a far from perfect transmission medium. There are many different sources of interference that can make the receiver hear a 1 when a 0 was sent, and vice versa. It's important to know when this has happened, so most protocols use a checksum of sorts, often something called a CRC. The receiver computes the CRC as it receives the data, and the last byte of the packet includes the CRC as the transmitter computed it. If they don't match, the receiver throws the packet away and waits for a retransmission.The Omnipod protocol used a standard 8-bit CRC, so when we found this, we thought we were really close to having the messages figured out. Little did we know…Messages, CRC16Some messages are too big to fit into a single packet, so they are sent as multiple packets. We started to piece together the format of messages, and noticed another set of bits at the end of each message that looked like a 16-bit crc. But it was weird; 5 of the 16 bits were never set. We tried many different techniques to figure out how this was being set, but nothing worked.This was the first big blocker; we could proceed to work out what the other bits in the messages were, but it would be little help to understand what was being sent, but not be able to generate new packets ourselves, and so progress slowed down.Months passed with little progress, and finally in winter of 2016 a member of the group with the handle @lorelai posted that she had sucessfully dumped the firmware from the larger ARM-based chip on the PDM, and started the tedious process of disassembly: taking cpu instructions and turning them into human understandable code with semantic variable and function names. She did an amazing job figuring out what various methods were involved in sending data over the radio.I was looking at one of the unnamed routines, and noticed it looked like a standard implementation of a table based CRC calculation. And the table had the values for a standard 16 bit CRC. I wrote my own implementation using the table, and it checked out like a normal CRC. Then I looked closely at how the function was written. A normal CRC implementation looks like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &lt;&lt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Theirs looked like this:while (len--) { crc = (crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ crctable[((crc &gt;&gt; 8) ^ *c++)];}Spot the difference? What should've been a bitwise left shift operator had somehow been coded as a right shift. This is a bug; there is no reason to cripple your own CRC algorithm, as it makes it less likely to catch corrupted messages.We were up and running again! We started working on decoding messages, recording sessions from the PDM for delivering boluses, temp basals, suspends, etc…NonceAll of the insulin delivery commands had a 4-byte chunk of data near the beginning of the message that looked like it might be some form of cryptography. Again, we tried many different ways of interpreting it, and analyzing it in the context of the messages it was sent in, but it wasn't a crc (we'd see the same 4 bytes on occasion even when the message data was different). And sometimes we'd see the pattern repeat. It looked maybe this was a bit of the protocol designed to prevent replay of data. Other protocols had features like this, called a nonce.One possible route we had considered was to record a database of messages to replay for given commands. Even if the address of each pod was different, now that we knew how to generate the message crc, we could take a copy of the command we had seen before, put a new address on the message, and recompute the crc. Except this nonce was preventing us from using that strategy. For the next insulin delivery command, no matter what command was sent, the pod would only accept the next nonce in the sequence, and we didn't know how to generate the next nonce.But hey! We have the decompiled PDM firmware now, we can just look there! So we pored over the PDM firmware, and tracked down the message generation in the code, and found where those four bytes should be. But instead of a method computing some cryptographic Nonce, we just found the four characters ""INS.. WTF?!?! Ok, somehow this area of the message must be being updated later in the pipeline.There was another chip on the PDM, closer to the radio. It was the same chip that was used in the Pods, a chip with an identifier of SC9S08ER48, something that wasn't documented online, and was likely produced custom for Insulet. Maybe we could get the firmware off of that chip. Unfortunately, that chip was locked, which prevented dumping of firmware.Again, progress slowed… This felt like a real dead end. We had thrown all our smarts at this nonce, and didn't have any good leads on the math that was behind it. And the ER48 that (possibly) held the secrets was locked and it was hard to find any public details that might help us crack it.X-Ray imagesIn trying to understand more about the ER48, some members of the slack community offered to try to get Xray images, which was really cool, but unfortunately didn't open up any new avenues.Overview XrayDetail XrayDecapping andÂ ImagingDan Caron decided to reach out to a researcher, Dr. Sergei Skorobogatov, at the University of Cambridge in the UK that he had read about who had experience in extracting code from locked chips, and convinced him to take a look at our problem. Dr. Skorobogatov had led research in using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) for chip reverse engineering and suggested it might be possible, but would be expensive, needing access to expensive equipment, and not guaranteed. Joe Moran, who had recently started using Loop after we met at the Fall 2016 Nightscout Hackathon dove in to helping out with this project, and arranged with a bay area company, Nanolab Technologies, to perform the decapping and imaging of the chips, and also graciously funded Nanolab and Dr Skorobogatov's work (and also his personal boxes of pods).Dr. Skorobogatov had Nanolab perform a variety of imaging techniques to ascertain if the protection could be defeated with known non-invasive or semi-invasive methods. This resulted in a lot of images, some of them very beautiful. These are optical microscope pictures of the silicon die.Optical microscope dieÂ overviewOptical microscope dieÂ overviewThere were also images taken of specific areas of the die using scanning electron microscopy. Attempts were made with different voltages, different surface preparations, and different equipment.SEM Image of flash memory cells. Not resolving data.Unfortunately, none of these produced images capable of resolving the actual contents of the flash.Dr. Skorobogatov had one last resort method that was only to be used if these other techniques failed. It was a proprietary method that would have to be given the blessing to be used by the University. Dr. Skorobogatov did an initial test and confirmed that it was capable of resolving the data on this chip. But before we could proceed an NDA had to be agreed upon and so negotiations about who was to be the recipient of the extracted firmware were undertaken.The Nightscout foundation would ultimately be the party signing the NDA and would take the responsibility to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the methods and results of the extraction.The result of this arrangement and work was an incredible paper written by Dr Sergei Skorobogatov, and the raw firmware data. The initial extraction of the firmware had a significant number of errors, but was enough to get started on. Joe asked at the spring Nightscout Foundation Hack if anyone would be up for digging into the disassembly. Nobody raised their hands. Turning the cpu instructions into something understandable is painstaking work, and there are very few people who know how to do it. I tried digging into it, using cpu instruction documentation, but made very little progress, and grew frustrated. Others optimistically asked for request to the firmware with big expectations of fast progress, and then realized the scope and challenge of the task and quietly dropped off.Example disassembly of SC908 instructionsIt turns out Joe also has an extensive background working at the assembly level, and started taking on the onerous task himself. In July, Dr. Skorobogatov had completed a second extraction with much fewer errors. Over the summer Joe Moran worked tirelessly on mapping out the huge amount of cpu instructions, and slowly fitting them together into a larger picture of pod pseudocode.Eventually, Ken Shirriff, an expert in hardware reverse engineering, would join the effort and sped up the process considerably. Together, Joe and Ken eventually mapped out enough code to find the function responsible for coding the nonce September of 2017.RileyLink andÂ LoopWe had been updating the openomni python scripts with our understanding of the comms, but now it was time to start focusing on RileyLink + iOS, so I started work on OmniKit, and firmware updates for the RileyLink. I believed we had the fundamentals of the protocol worked out, and the rest was just details. Again, completely underestimating how much more was ahead of us.I had to write new firmware that would handle the pod modulation and encoding. I also had to rewrite the way the two chips on the RL talked to each other to handle 0's, as 0 was a special end of packet marker for Medtronic. Much in Loop needed to be reworked to support multiple Pumps, and new interfaces made to support pairing, deactivating, and handling faults. Thankfully Nate Racklyeft had set a solid foundation in Loop for this to happen.Meanwhile, work on understanding the format of the commands continued and was documented thoroughly on the openomni wiki, which is the most comprehensive documentation on the pod protocol published publicly. Joe, Evariste, and Eelke Jager really did a massive amount of work decoding messages, and updating the pages over time. Various members of the slack channel have contributed captures of PDM to Pod communications to aid decoding efforts.The decoding was fun work, with lots of small wins as each component of each command is deciphered, and I really enjoyed working on this part, and adding code to Loop to implement. In April of 2018 I shared on slack that I had ""paired via iPhone + RL, primed, cannula insertion, basal schedule programmed, and then bolused 5U.The 2.0 RL firmware was finished in July of 2018, and new shipments started including it. It was hoped that these boards would be able to be used with Loop and Omnipod, but the existing 915 MHz antenna would prove to be too poor to do 433 MHz comms effectively.Decoding and implementation was progressed well over the summer, and the Loop experience was coming together. Joe did an amazing thing in providing funding for me to quit my day job, and focus more on this project, and to eventually join the wonderful Tidepool team. There were of course more events happening outside of the omnipod RE story in the DIY and regulator spaces that I won't cover, but it was a very interesting summer!ScreamersAs more functionality came online in the driver, I started hooking it up into Loop, including the ability to automatically adjust delivery by temp basals. At this point it was fairly common to get a screaming pod, which meant some of the pod's internal checking had detected a situation where it decided there was a problem and it should not continue to deliver insulin.But it seemed like a workable problem, as we continued to find small discrepancies in what Loop was sending versus what the PDM would send if the command was delivered manually, and I assumed if we fixed all of those that the screaming would stop.Looping!On October 3, 2018, Joe put a Loop controlled pod on himself and became the first Loop Omnipod user, but didn't tell me immediately as he knew I'd be worrying. When he did tell me, I still worried. We had seen the pod work, and understood the functionality, and the basic algorithm of Loop had been vetted for a long time, but still…A month later, at the November 2018 Nightscout Hackathon, a few more adventurous souls opted try it out for themselves as well, and became part of a small private testing group that would grow to over 30 people before the branch was made public.Unfortunately, we still had screamers often happening before the full 3 days of use were finished, and we had meticulously compared Loop's commands to PDM reference versions. Eelke was particularly helpful with this process, creating a script that could check commands against their reference versions automatically. I started to get worried that the increased demands on the battery for doing communication every five minutes had pushed the pod over the edge of what was sustainable.Pod voltage taps, drilled through back plastic, super-glued inÂ place.So I started measuring pod voltage with an arduino, recording the data and storing it a local database for visualization. Comparing PDM and Loop.Long time scale view of podÂ voltage.Unfortunately, this proved to be a dead end as well; using a PDM and bolusing large amounts, I could drive the pod to lower voltages than even Loop would do over the life of a looping pod, and wasn't able to make the pod scream. It seemed like voltage wasn't the issue, so there must be something else.RileyLinks with 955 MHz (left) and coil 433 MHz (right)Â antennasAt one point I noticed that if a message exchange with the pod failed, the pod would sometimes be left in a state of trying to complete the exchange by re-sending packets over and over and over. Testers logs were also showing lots of failures, and so I started experimenting with antennas. Both of these problems should be improved with better comms. I had planned on trying different antennas and had ordered from random places on the internet, but hadn't had time to try them until it became a priority.I had some flexible 433 MHz antennas that could be taped on the inside of the RL case. These would often have great performance in some scenarios, but not in others; it was too unreliable. When I got to the coil based one, it had good performance very consistently, and at very surprising ranges. Time for a new RileyLink case.With the new antenna, and some optimizations to do fewer message exchanges while still allowing adjustments every 5 minutes, the frequency of screamers went down to a very low rate. Likely comparable to using a pod normally with a PDM. In the most recent 7,500 hours of live testing, 94% of pods completed without faults.Testing and DocumentationThe testing group grew slowly, which was a great way to continually get new eyes on the system and see what parts were confusing. These testers put up with a lot of screaming pods, and contributed in very big ways to making Loop with Omnipod work better. They did this primarily by sharing issue reports from each of their pods, whether successful or not.The issue reports have a message log in them that could be analyzed by the tool that Eelke built, giving us insight into whether we had any misformatted commands and also let us gather statistics around certain parts of Loop's interaction with the pods.Marion Barker joined the testing group and added dedicated reporting, and additional statistics to the progress of testing, and we were able to use her stats of successful pods vs failures to have a high level view of progress.Eventually Katie DiSimone joined the testing group, and started a large restructuring of loopdocs.org to provide documentation for using Loop with multiple devices. The anticipation around a version of Loop that worked with Omnipod was incredibly high, and without good documentation, it was certain that we'd be flooded with the same questions over and over.New Features ForÂ LoopOmnipod integration required rethinking of some interface elements, and adding new controls. The pod doesn't report battery, and there is little a user can do about a low battery if one were to somehow happen, so displaying a battery level widget didn't make sense. Also, without a UI on the pump, the user needs to be able to cancel a bolus quickly. The reservoir icon was a picture of a Medtronic reservoir, so we wanted to rethink that. Thank you to Paul Forgione for designing the pod logo that now shows reservoir level.ThanksThank you to all the people who help make this long road come to a place where we can share this with others, and realize the goal that we set out to do a long time ago. I know I didn't cover everyone, and everything that happened. That would be impossible in a single post, and for me, since I only have my experience through this. It's hard to imagine the total hours put into this. If you could add them all up, I'm sure it would be shocking. Not to mention the work that has gone into making the Omnipod itself, which I imagine dwarfs this effort. So thank you *all*. Also, many of those hours would otherwise have been spent with families. I really appreciate my wife and kids being understanding with the time I've spent on this, and want to thank them too.SidenotesI have to mention Joakim Ornstedt, as one of the contributors to openomni decoding, and also the creator of what is probably actually the first looping integration with omnipod. He built a device that used optical character recognition (OCR) on the PDM to get data from the PDM, and wired in digital button presses to the PDM through another microcontroller. It's a hard to scale approach, but very clever, and bypasses a lot of the issues we had to deal with for an RE based solution. I really admired him for pulling this off, and getting looping in a tiny fraction of the time it took to make it work with Loop.",https://t.co/fYeSqO25hp,news
An Easy Pill to Swallow: Human Trials to Better Treat Diabetes Underway Across U.S.,"Trials to improve the way diabetes is treated are taking place under U.S. FDA guidance at 37 research centers across the U.S. Clinics in 13 states are testing an oral form of insulin on nearly 300 Americans that could delay, and in some cases may even negate, the need for use of needles for many type 2 diabetics.The trials are being spearheaded by diabetes innovator Oramed Pharmaceuticals , based in New York, which aims to be the first to market with oral insulin, the Holy Grail of diabetes care that has eluded researchers for decades. This is the company's largest and most advanced clinical trial under direction of the FDA to date.""The advancement we're making in the development of oral insulin is good news for the estimated 30 million Americans with diabetes,"" said Oramed CEO Nadav Kidron. ""Experts have long said that patients with diabetes would benefit from earlier insulin intervention, but for various reasons, insulin injections are currently the last line of treatment. Our pill would allow for earlier, more effective treatment.""In addition, studies show that almost a quarter of Americans are afraid of needles, and this fear could cause many diabetics to skip their needed injections, Kidron said. He explained that oral insulin is geared towards providing a more convenient, effective and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.""Non-compliance to diabetes medications is a major cause of hospitalizations and can lead to serious health complications,"" he explained. ""Compliance rates would likely improve if people could take insulin in a capsule form rather than an injection."" Kidron also points to an environmental benefit of taking capsules over shots: ""Imagine how many fewer syringes and needles would be thrown away once oral insulin is a reality.""Diabetes is a growing concern world-wide, with studies showing some 425 million adults have diabetes globally and that number is expected to reach 629 million by 2045. To this end, the company has also signed a licensing deal with HTIT, a Chinese pharmaceutical company that is now working with Oramed to bring oral insulin to China. More than 10 percent of the Chinese adult population suffers from diabetes, and like other areas of the world, this trend is only increasing, with some 50 percent of the adult Chinese population estimated to be prediabetic. Working with the China Food and Drug Administration to gain approval, HTIT is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into building the infrastructure to bring oral insulin to China..Oramed's oral capsule to treat type 2 diabetes promises to be a game changer for people with diabetes. According to Kidron, Oramed's technology delivers oral insulin in a way that a needle could never replicate, providing a more efficient and safer platform for delivering insulin by mimicking the body's natural process of insulin going directly to the liver rather than via the bloodstream. He said that because injections introduce insulin directly into the bloodstream, only a fraction reaches the liver, often causing excess sugar to be stored in fat and muscle which can result in weight gain.With Oramed's proprietary platform, the active insulin is protected as it travels through the stomach and into the intestine, and its absorption is increased along the intestinal wall. ""The result is better glucose control, reduced hyper and hypoglycemia, and potentially less weight gain — and treatment can begin earlier, improving outcomes,"" he said.",https://t.co/H4EQvPvmnK,news

"Frederick Banting, Charles Best, James Collip, and John Macleod","In the early 1920s Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin under the directorship of John Macleod at the University of Toronto. With the help of James Collip insulin was purified, making it available for the successful treatment of diabetes. Banting and Macleod earned a Nobel Prize for their work in 1923.At the turn of the 20th century a strict low-calorie, no-carbohydrate diet was the only effective treatment for diabetes. But this method, with food intake sometimes as low as 500 calories per day, had its consequences, as slow starvation, like diabetes, drained patients of their strength and energy, leaving them semi-invalids. The diet treatment also required an inordinate amount of willpower on the part of the patient, very few of whom were able to maintain low-calorie diets over the long term. In 1921 researchers at the University of Toronto began a series of experiments that would ultimately lead to the isolation and commercial production of insulin—a pancreatic hormone essential for metabolizing carbohydrates—and the successful treatment of diabetes.Setting the Stage for the Discovery of InsulinThe connection between pancreatic secretions and diabetes was first shown in 1889 by two German physiologists at the University of Strasbourg, Oskar Minkowski and Joseph von Mering. While investigating the effect of pancreatic secretions on the metabolism of fat, they performed a complete pancreatectomy on a laboratory dog, only to discover that the animal developed a disease indistinguishable from diabetes. Twenty years earlier a German medical student, Paul Langerhans, had discovered two systems of cells in the pancreas: the acini, which he knew produced the pancreatic digestive secretions, and another system whose function was unknown to him. These cells looked to Langerhans like tiny clusters of cells, or islands, floating among the acini. In 1901 Eugene Opie, an American pathologist at Johns Hopkins University, made the association between the degeneration of these cells, which had been named the ""islets of Langerhans,"" and the onset of diabetes. Through the experimental efforts of these and many other researchers, the stage was set for the discovery of insulin—the hormonal antidiabetic secretion of the islets of Langerhans—in the first decades of the 20th century.Frederick BantingIn 1920 Frederick Grant Banting (1891–1941) was a surgeon in a floundering practice in London, Ontario, Canada. The youngest son of Methodist farmers from Alliston, Ontario, Banting almost entered the Methodist ministry but decided at the last moment that his calling lay in medicine. World War I shortened his five-year medical course at the University of Toronto: his class did its entire fifth year during the summer of 1916 and, upon receiving their hasty degrees, went off to war. Banting served as a battalion medical officer in the Canadian Army Medical Corps; he returned to Toronto in 1919 after having been wounded in the arm by shrapnel. He trained as a surgeon at the Hospital of Sick Children in Toronto, then decided to open a small practice as a surgeon in London, Ontario. Unfortunately, his earnings from his practice were meager, forcing him to take a position as a demonstrator in the local medical school. It was in this capacity that Banting was preparing a lecture about the function of the pancreas on October 30, 1920. He stopped at the medical school library, where he picked up the latest issue of Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics, and read an article titled ""The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, with Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.""Banting Approaches John MacleodWhile thinking about pancreatic secretions after reading the article, Banting jotted down an idea for a preliminary experiment to further investigate the relationship between pancreatic secretions and diabetes. On November 7, following the advice of a colleague, Banting brought his idea to the attention of John James Rickard Macleod (1876–1935), a Scottish physiologist and expert in carbohydrate metabolism at his alma mater, the University of Toronto.Macleod, the son of a minister, received his medical training at the University of Aberdeen and his biochemical training at the University of Leipzig. In 1903 Macleod emigrated to the United States to take a position as professor of physiology at Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio. After 15 years at Western, Macleod accepted a professorship at the University of Toronto, where he conducted research on respiration.Earlier in his career Macleod had published a series of papers on glycosuria, or the presence of sugar in the urine (a common indication of diabetes). As a scientist familiar with the literature on the subject, he was unimpressed with Banting's range of knowledge about diabetes and the pancreas and skeptical about the soundness of Banting's idea. However, Macleod decided to give him lab space, an assistant, and some laboratory dogs for two months at the end of the academic year.Experiments BeginBanting and his assistant, Charles Herbert Best (1899–1978), began their experiments in May 1921. Best, the American son of Canadian parents, had just finished his bachelor's degree in physiology and biochemistry at the University of Toronto and had been hired as a research assistant to Macleod, his former teacher. Macleod assigned him to Banting, and the 29-year-old surgeon and the 22-year-old assistant began their work together.A combination of timing and good luck enabled the Toronto researchers to be the first to announce the discovery of insulin. Scientists in Germany and Hungary had come very close to finding pure insulin, but lack of funding and the devastation of World War I halted their progress. Following in the footsteps of earlier researchers, Banting and Best began to study diabetes through an experimental combination of duct ligation, which involved tying off the pancreatic duct to the small intestine, and pancreatectomies, or the complete surgical removal of the pancreas. Duct ligation served to atrophy the acini cells that produced the digestive secretions, leaving behind only the cells of the islets of Langerhans. Duct-ligated dogs, it was discovered, did not develop diabetes. Pancreatectomy was the method of inducing diabetes: when all pancreatic tissue was removed, the experimental dogs immediately showed signs of glycosuria.Banting's idea of October 30 involved ligation of the pancreatic ducts of a dog and the extraction and isolation of whatever secretions were produced after the atrophy of the acini cells. He and Best began this experiment, only to find that it was difficult to keep duct-ligated, depancreatized dogs alive long enough to carry out any tests. After a summer of many setbacks and failures, however, the team reported in the fall that they were keeping a severely diabetic dog alive with injections of an extract made from duct-ligated pancreas and prepared, following Macleod's instructions, in saline. Amazingly, this extract dramatically lowered the blood sugar levels of diabetic experimental dogs.Findings Are Presented and Tensions BeginOn December 30, 1921, Macleod, Banting, and Best presented their findings at the conference of the American Physiological Society, at Yale University. Banting, out of nervousness and inexperience, did a poor job delivering the paper, and the audience was highly critical of the findings presented. Macleod, as the chair of the session, joined the discussion in an attempt to rescue Banting from the scathing commentary. After this fiasco Banting became convinced that Macleod had stepped in to steal the credit from him and Best, and relations between the two began to deteriorate.Purifying Insulin and the First Human TestsAt the end of 1921 Macleod invited James Bertram Collip (1892–1965), a biochemist in the department of physiology at the University of Toronto, to help Banting and Best with purifying their extract. Collip, another University of Toronto graduate, was on sabbatical from the University of Alberta and, supported by a fellowship, had returned to his alma mater. As the experimental pace quickened, Banting and Best needed large amounts of their extract, and Collip set to work purifying the extract for clinical testing in humans.The first clinical tests on a human patient were conducted on a severely diabetic 14-year-old boy. Although the injections of the extract failed to have resoundingly beneficial effects, the Toronto team continued to experiment. A short while later Collip made a breakthrough in purifying the extract, using alcohol in slightly over 90 percent concentration to precipitate out the active ingredient (insulin). At the same time, though, personal tension was mounting among the four scientists, as Banting became increasingly bitter toward Macleod and pitted himself and Best against Collip in the race to purify the extract. At the end of January, Collip came to Banting and Best's lab and informed the two that although he had discovered a method to produce pure extract, he would share it only with Macleod. It was only Best's quick restraint that stopped Banting from attacking Collip. Fortunately for the future of insulin an uneasy agreement made a few days later allowed them to continue to work together. On May 3, 1922, Macleod, representing the group, announced to the international medical community at a meeting of the Association of American Physicians that they had discovered ""insulin""—the antidiabetic agent.Nobel PrizeBanting and Macleod received the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of insulin. That the Nobel committee chose only Banting and Macleod for the award caused more animosity. Banting, outraged that Macleod was chosen to share the prize with him, immediately announced that he would split his winnings with Best. Macleod, perhaps in reaction to Banting's gesture, announced that he, too, would be splitting his award, with Collip. By the end of 1923 insulin had been in commercial production for a year at the Eli Lilly and Company laboratories in Indianapolis. Diabetic patients who received insulin shots recovered from comas, resumed eating carbohydrates (in moderation), and realized they had been given a new lease on life.The information contained in this biography was last updated on December 1, 2017.SaveSave",https://t.co/s3rno83pLR,news
New Glasgow woman wants government to pay more of the tab for insulin pumps,"NEW GLASGOW, N.S. — MacLaren personally lobbied the government to help cover the cost of insulin pumpsThe difference between the cost of a pump and the amount covered by the government still leaves many families unable to afford the devicesMacLaren argues that providing pumps and supplies for young people is a wise investment for the Department of HealthThe government says it prioritizes families with lower incomesIt's been six years since budget day 2013, but Tammy MacLaren still remembers it clearly.It was that day that her personal lobbying efforts helped convince the provincial government to create the Nova Scotia Insulin Pump Program.""Budget day 2013 was a good day,"" she says of the program, which helps cover the cost of insulin pumps and supplies for children. In 2015 the program was expanded to include people up to age 25.But six years since it was introduced, MacLaren says she's come to realize the help for families isn't at the level it needs to be.MacLaren recently read about the Cameron family in Tatamagouche whose nine-year-old daughter Courtney was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. The family told the Truro News about their fears of Courtney's blood sugars dropping off at night and how much an insulin pump would help. But at a cost of $7,200, the price tag is a bit steep for the family to afford. The family's work insurance will pay $2,000 towards the cost of the pump, while the Nova Scotia Insulin Pump Program will contribute another $1,000. That leaves more than $4,000 for the family to come up with on their own.""I didn't know there was that much of a gap,"" MacLaren said. ""The average person should not have that big of a gap to come up with. That is a big gap and a big chunk of change to come up with.""Most insulin pumps cost in the range of $7,000-$9,000, she said, and she believes the Insulin Pump Program scale needs to be adjusted, allotting more funds to families applying.MacLaren recently wrote a letter to all the provincial MLAs asking for them to support an adjusted scale. To date she has only heard back from five of those MLAs.She said she's also been unsuccessful in attempts to set up an interview with Health Minister Randy Delorey about the matter.""I know he's busy, but he's not busy all the time,"" MacLaren said. ""I want to meet with him to discuss this.""She argues that providing insulin pumps and supplies for youth under 25 is a wise investment for the Department of Health.""A healthier young diabetic should turn into a healthier adult diabetic, thus reducing health-care costs."" she said.To date she said she's been unable to get information on how many people are covered through the program or how the amount families are given is determined.According to information on the Insulin Pump Program provided online at https://novascotia.ca/DHW/NSIPP/, the program is based on family income, and family size.""Families with lower incomes will receive the most help through our program,"" the website states. ""This is to ensure we can help the people who can least afford to pay.""Like the provincial Family Pharmacare program, there is an annual co-payment as well. The website also includes a financial eligibility calculator.",https://t.co/Y18HHdHSdQ,news
"Outrage over the cost of the life-saving drug insulin has drugmakers scrambling, but Congress and the public demand a price cut","Insulin is a decades-old, lifesaving medicine. But prices have increased so much that many Americans with diabetes cannot afford it. The outcry has heated up lately, including with multiple inquiries from lawmakers and hearings. Healthcare companies have responded with new programs to ease costs for certain patients and certain products. But critics say drug companies should just lower prices. Visit BusinessInsider.com for more stories. Insulin is a decades-old, life-sustaining medicine.And yet prices are so high that Americans with diabetes have been forced to take desperate measures, including rationing the drug.This has been a problem for years. But the outcry has heated up lately, with lawmakers repeatedly – and increasingly forcefully – asking drug companies and other healthcare players at congressional hearings why insulin is so expensive.""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois told healthcare executives at a Wednesday congressional hearing about insulin prices. ""Your days are numbered.""Companies have been forced to respond. They have announced a variety of new programs aimed at limiting how much patients pay out of their own wallets.These measures have attracted criticism as being ""PR stunts,"" though, because they apply only in specific circumstances, or for specific products. Six million Americans rely on insulin each day, according to the American Diabetes Association.And none of the three big companies that make insulin have simply lowered prices. New insulin programs announced lately include: The drugmaker Sanofi will, starting in June, make up to 10 boxes of its insulin pens or vials available each month for $US99. This program was first put in place a year ago, but then it got patients just one vial of insulin or box of pens for $US99-$US149. The expanded program is intended for anyone paying high prices out-of-pocket, and there is no income eligibility requirement, Sanofi said. The health company Express Scripts is capping how much people with diabetes pay for insulin at just $US25 a month. The patient's employer has to both contract with Express Scripts and opt in to the program. Drug company Eli Lilly is making a generic version of its insulin and one of the most commonly-used types, Humalog, available for $US137.35 a vial or $US265.20 for a box of five pens – half the price of the brand name.

How an Obsolete Medical Device With a Security Flaw Became a Must-Have For Some Patients With Type 1 Diabetes,"108485720story From a report on The Atlantic: In 2014, a few hackers realized that the security flaw in certain Medtronic pumps could be exploited for a DIY revolution. Type 1 diabetes is a disease where the pancreas is unable to produce insulin to control blood sugar. For years, Boss (the anecdote in the story who purchased used insulin pumps from some dealer on Craiglist) had counted, down to the gram, the carbohydrates in every meal and told his pump how much insulin to dispense. [...] By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas -- a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin -- were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop. They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems -- none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one. Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work -- for now.",https://t.co/DldNUH2sba,news
"US researchers explore link between sugar, insulin, keto, and cancer","The groundbreaking work of US cancer researcher Lewis Cantley, PhD, linking the ketogenic diet to an anti-cancer drug, is receiving prominent coverage in the medical media.Dr. Cantley, who is based at Weill Cornell MedicineÂ in New York City, is leading a research program in which a powerful anti-cancer drug is paired with the ketogenic diet in effort to starve cancer cells of the glucose and insulin they need to grow and spread. His work, now in clinical trials with women with endometrial cancer, was detailed in a new feature inÂ The Medical ExpressÂ this week.Medical Express:Â Increasing evidence of a strong connection between sugar and cancerA number of years ago, Cantley discovered a special enzyme, called PI3 kinase, which some are calling ""the master switch for cancer."" As the article notes:It turned out that the gene that encodes PI3K is the most frequently mutated cancer-promoting gene in humans â€"" and in the years since Dr. Cantley's revolutionary discovery, it has been implicated in as many as 80 percent of cancers, including those of the breast, brain and bladder.Cantley is touted to be in contention for the Nobel Prize in medicine for his discovery. But now Cantley and his team have created drugs that inhibit PI3K. However, their research also found that despite the new drug's ability to inhibit PI3K, the continuing presence of high insulin drives further cancer growth. How to get the insulin levels down? The ketogenic diet!Â His groundbreaking work, in which PI3K inhibitors plus the ketogenic diet shrank cancers in mice, received prominent coverage in pre-eminent journalÂ NatureÂ inÂ July 2018. Now the work has moved into clinical trials in humans.In December, Dr. Bret Scher wrote about this promising avenue of research in a column for Diet Doctor.Â Dr. Scher's post was a summary of a larger piece written by famous oncologist and author Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee inÂ The New York Times Magazine,Â which also describes Dr. Cantley's ground-breaking work.

Better Insulin Pump for My Son,"Eric has type 1 diabetes. He was diagnosed at age 9.For the first two years we did ok in managing his glucose. But soon after turning 11 his needs changed, and we had a hard time controlling his glucose with injections. At this time, we also had an endocrinologist (diabetes doctor) who didn't fit with our family and our lifestyle. We are night owls and work the late-night to graveyard shifts so our family is used to being up late. Also, Eric has ADHD since age 5 and Cerebral Palsy since age 2. So, his mind is always running a mile-a-minute and sleeping is hard for him. We were constantly in a battle getting him to sleep a ""normal"" schedule. In 2014 Eric started going into DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) where his blood was more acidic than alkaline, and this would make him very sick. We were giving him insulin and checking his glucose. But Eric's needs were not being met. For two years we were in and out of the hospital with DKA and dehydration. Eric was also on Adderall for ADHD which has an appetite suppression side effect. This would make him have ""hunger"" and ""thirst"" ketones. Which would build while he was at school not eating or drinking anything while his glucose was fine and within a normal range. He missed most of his 5th grade year due to being home with ketones or in the hospital.Finally, in October of 2016 another endocrinologist saw him while he was admitted. She came in a spoke with us. She asked why he was hospitalized so often and we explained why. She immediately took over his care and ordered Eric a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) called a Dexcom. This tiny device changed our lives.In November 2016 Eric received his Dexcom. We set it up and within a month his glucose started to stabilize because we were alerted to when glucose started to rise so we could swoop in and dose him with his insulin. From November to January his A1C (blood test that measures average glucose over a three-month period) went from 11.7 to 9.6. This means that at 11.7 his average glucose was 328 (his target was 150). In January it dropped to 9.6. This means that at 9.6 his average glucose was 258. That was 70 points lower. It also meant he was able to start another chapter in his diabetes management.It was decided in February that since Eric's A1C was below 10 that he could start on an insulin pump. This is a device that takes over the delivery of insulin. No more shots every time he eats or at bedtime. This would automatically give him small doses of insulin each hour of the day and night. It would also take the need for us to calculate how much insulin he would need for carbs and corrections, it would do it for us. This was truly a life saver for our family. Eric calls it his candy; his ""lifesavers"". Eric was so happy to be able to get this device. We decided (based on the diabetic educator's recommendation) to go with Animas Ping insulin pump. We went through training and in March went live with insulin. Eric was a different kid.He began gaining weight and growing in height for the first time in years. In the first year with the Dexcom and 9 months with the pump, he gained a foot in height and 55 pounds. His A1C kept going down and he kept growing and getting better and his diabetes management.Earlier this year, Animas the manufacturer of his pump, announced that they were pulling out of the pump industry and that all Animas patients could switch to a Medtronic insulin pump free of charge. While the news of them leaving the pump industry was worrisome, I did feel a bit better with another manufacture coming in to take over; until I read the reviews of Medtronic pumps and looked at the other pumps on the market. I was sorely disappointed in Animas to choose a partner with such a bad reputation.Eric is now 15 and going against another hurdle. His insulin needs are changing again. He needs more insulin each month and the current pump doesn't support that need. He is supposed to be able to use his insulin or pump site for 3 days with a insulin capacity of 2mL. Currently we refill his insulin cartridge every day. Plus, due to his activity level he has had to replace his pump 3 times due to the pump being made from plastic it cracks.(source: Tandem Diabetic YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84vPQLVSpTI)We need to raise $5000 to purchase a new pump from Tandem, as his insurance only pays for a new pump every four years. They have a pump that has an insulin capacity of 3 mL compared to the 2 mL that his current pump has. Which means that it can keep up with him through puberty and young adulthood when his insulin needs stabilize. Also, Tandem's pump is made of all metal with a near indestructible glass touchscreen that does not crack or break. This also makes giving him insulin even easier than having to scroll through all the numbers, lists and such that Animas does.

Carbs were restricted to about 30 to 50 grams daily, with an emphasis on nuts and non-starchy vegetables. Food was also provided, either as groceries the keto dieters could use to prepare meals themselves or as pre-prepared frozen meals.Keto diet participants had near-daily check-ins during which they reported blood ketone measurements from a self-administered finger-prick test and received feedback, usually through text messages, from the research team. Ketosis was defined as a blood concentration of ketones, chemicals made in the liver, between 0.5 and 5.0 mM (millimolar).""Depending on their readings, we would talk about their food and drink choices and suggest they adjust their diet to maintain ketosis,"" said lead author Richard LaFountain, a postdoctoral researcher at Ohio State.Both groups, whose schedules included regular resistance training, showed comparable physical performance levels at the end of the study. This was important because it's difficult to lose weight without losing some lean muscle mass and physical function, Volek said.""We showed that a group of people with military affiliation could accept a ketogenic diet and successfully lose weight, including visceral adipose tissue, a type of fat strongly associated with chronic disease. This could be the first step toward a bigger study looking at the potential benefits of ketogenic eating in the armed forces,"" said Volek, who has authored books on the benefits of low-carb diets and is a founder of a company seeking to help people with type 2 diabetes through ketogenic diets and a virtual health care model.The study results come with caveats. The group that followed the ketogenic diet chose to be in the test group, something that scientists call self-selection. Studies in which participants are randomized are preferred, but the research team said they wanted to do this pilot study in a group eager to adhere to the diet. The keto group also had a higher average body mass index at the start of the study – 27.9 versus 24.9 in the comparison group – meaning they had more fat to lose.About seven in 10 people who are otherwise eligible to enter military service in the United States are considered unfit because of their weight, LaFountain said.Officers or trainees on military bases likely could maintain a ketogenic diet based on the various foods that are already offered at typical meals, but more options could be added to support this weight-loss strategy, he said.Added Volek, ""The military has called obesity a national security crisis. One of the potential benefits of this diet in the military is that you can lose weight without having to count calories, which could be difficult in training or while on active duty. In this study, they ate as much as they wanted – they just ate differently.""Other Ohio State researchers who worked on the study were Vincent Miller, Emily Barnhart, Parker Hyde, Christopher Crabtree, Mathew Beeler, Alex Buga, Teryn Sapper, Jay Short, Madison Bowling, William Kraemer, Orlando Simonetti and Carl Maresh.",https://t.co/DW3gKWRTxn,news
Sleep and weight gain: why late-night snacking could be part of the problem,"What late-night snacking has to do with sleep Participants in a new study ate more after dinner when they were sleep-deprived. By Julia Belluz on March 26, 2019 7:30 am Light-night snacking isn't just something college students dabble in. It's a guilt-laden habit that haunts people of all ages, particularly those who struggle with their weight. So what might contribute to the urge for cookies and chips after dinner? A new study suggests it could be sleep deprivation. Even when study participants were allowed to catch up on sleep over the weekend, the cravings persisted. For the paper, published in February in the journal Current Biology, researchers used a deliciously rigorous study design to tease out the health effects of not sleeping enough and whether sleeping too little during the week could be offset by a lazy weekend lie-in. (Hat tip to Dr. Perry Wilson at Medscape, who first brought it to our attention.) They took 36 healthy volunteers and confined them to a lab for two weeks. First, they had everyone sleep for nine hours per night for three nights. Then they randomly assigned the study participants to one of three groups: a ""sleep restriction"" group that was allowed to sleep just five hours per night; a control group that had the opportunity to sleep a luxurious nine hours per night; and a ""sleep recovery"" group that got only five hours per night for five nights, followed by a weekend sleep-in, and two more nights of sleep restriction. The researchers gathered data on how much each participant slept and ate, as well as tracking their insulin sensitivity — or how much of the hormone the body needed to secrete in order to manage blood sugar levels. (Low insulin sensitivity, and insulin resistance, is a harbinger of Type 2 diabetes.) They also tracked the participants' levels of melatonin, another hormone that indicates the body clock's biological day and night. What they found was an indictment of sleep deprivation — even after weekend catch-up sleep — and a potential explanation for why some diets fail. While all three groups ate about the same amount of calories, both of the sleep-deprived groups got more of their calories late in the day, in particular from snacking after dinner. They also gained more weight during the study period compared to the control group. So something about too little sleep spurred a heavier calorie intake later at night, and that difference showed up on the scale. Even more alarming, the underslept groups experienced a decrease in their insulin sensitivity — an effect the control group didn't see — meaning their patterns of eating and sleeping upset their metabolism in ways that could prime them for Type 2 diabetes. And again, weekend recovery sleep failed to protect people from decreased insulin sensitivity. It's only a short-term study, but a well-designed one — and it's important because it adds to a growing body of evidence that chronic sleep deprivation is a risk factor for both obesity and diabetes. The study is also a reminder that sleep is often missing from the discussion of weight gain and obesity — and it shouldn't be. To avoid tiredness-induced food cravings, we need to sleep well, consistently, every night. So what is it about not sleeping enough that encourages snacking and weight gain? There are a few potential explanations for why sleep-deprived folks gain weight more easily. One has to do with the metabolism. Before we get into the details, a quick recap on the three main ways our bodies metabolize energy. We've got the ""basal metabolic rate"" — or how you expend energy when you're resting. There's energy expenditure from physical activity. And there's ""diet-induced thermogenesis,"" the amount of energy your body uses in order to digest and absorb calories in food. That last one accounts for about 10 percent of the body's overall energy expenditure. Researchers have looked at whether people expend more energy processing a meal later in the day versus earlier and found that, independent of physical activity, the body uses less energy to digest food late in the day. So that means we may convert more calories to fat, instead of burning them off, when we eat late at night. Researchers have also repeatedly found that when we're tired — surprise, surprise — we eat more. In a meta-analysis of 11 studies, the authors showed that people ate 385 extra calories following a night of sleep deprivation. That's about the same amount as a serving of Häagen-Dazs peanut butter ice cream a day. There's a hormone hypothesis to explain this tendency: A lack of sleep hampers our hunger hormones leptin and ghrelin, potentially contributing to an increase in appetite. Sleep loss may also change how our brains perceive food, Vox's Brian Resnick has explained. A lack of sleep seems to alter our food-reward system, causing us to get more excited by a cupcake or french fries than we would if we were well rested. Besides weight gain, another important finding is that late-night eating is associated with a higher risk of diabetes. Researchers have shown that the body has a harder time managing glucose at night. And the reason is that the circadian system — the body's internal clock, which is running in every single cell — seems to regulate how the body manages calories at different times of the day. ""What we have found is that if you eat an identical meal in the morning or evening, the glucose response is relatively impaired in the evening compared to the morning,"" Dr. Frank Scheer, a neuroscientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told Vox previously. ""In the evening hours, we can't cope with the glucose load as well."" So not only do we do worse at managing calories when we're fatigued, and may more often eat late at night, but we tend to eat more calories too. Too many Americans are sleep-deprived While the official recommendation from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine is at least seven hours per night for adults, a third of Americans report sleeping less than that, on average. So how can we get more sleep? First, get your basic sleep hygiene in check: Avoid caffeine after lunch, exercise regularly but not too late in the day, and avoid alcohol and heavy meals before bed. And, for the love of God, get screens out of your bedroom. ""If you can maintain sleep stability, that means you are seeing that same light at the same time every day and your body will pick up on that,"" the author of Sleepyhead: The Neuroscience of a Good Night's Rest, Henry Nicholls, told Vox's Sean Illing. ""And yeah, most people do not appreciate how disruptive artificial light is to the brain. It confuses your brain into thinking it's daytime when it's actually bedtime."" Now we know that's the last thing we want to do if we're trying to lose weight.",https://t.co/hUx63VrnTs,news
Sanofi turns to subscriptions to offer patients insulin at $99 per month,"Louisiana has garnered plenty of headlines for its new ""Netflix"" approach to buying hepatitis C drugs. Now, Sanofi has unveiled a program that takes that model directly to patients, supplying insulin products for a flat monthly rate. The French drugmaker will use its Insulin Valyou Savings Program, which launched in a smaller form last year, to deliver its insulin products for $99 per month. At that fixed price, Sanofi will offer up to 10 boxes of insulin pens and 10 mL vials per month regardless of a patient's income.The new plan comes as insulin has become a flash point in the drug pricing debate. It's designed for people who are exposed to high out-of-pocket costs—such as uninsured patients—and for those who don't qualify for other access programs, a spokesman said. It'll take effect in June. Last year, Sanofi introduced the Insulin Valyou Savings Program to offer its basal insulin Lantus and mealtime insulin Admelog at $99 for one 10 mL vial or $149 for a box of pens. The company later expanded the program to cover all its insulins.The new $99-per-month price could be as little as one-tenth the amount patients would have paid before. The new structure can cover the full cost of patients' needs and allow patients to mix and match vials and packs, plus insulin types, Adam Gluck, Sanofi's head of U.S. external affairs, told FiercePharma. FierceBiotech Executive BreakfastGetting Real: The Changing Tide on Real-World Evidence in Drug DevelopmentJoin FierceBiotech and a panel of industry experts for an executive breakfast at BIO. We will discuss the impacts of real-world evidence on drug development and address the important questions that companies are facing including where to find the right talent &amp; technology and how to deploy it internally or with partners. Join us in Philadelphia on June 5th for this important discussion. RELATED: Now that Lilly has a cheaper generic Humalog, will Novo Nordisk and Sanofi follow?The company's initial savings program made a difference for patients who had been paying list prices, said Michelle Carnahan, the company's head of primary care in North America. But many patients needed more help. Sanofi went with the savings program approach, versus an authorized generic or list price cut, because it has full control over its access program, she said in an interview.The drug pricing system ""has so many unknowns and different pieces that we don't fully control, it becomes hard to make change,"" she said. Alternatively, ""this is something that we can fully own.""One drawback is that Sanofi can't offer the savings program to patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Sanofi said it supports changes to regulations that would allow Medicare and other patients to participate. Sanofi's move comes only a week after Cigna and Express Scripts unveiled a $25-per-month cap to insured patients' out-of-pocket insulin costs.Wednesday's announcement is the latest move by an insulin maker to address access and affordability questions. For years, Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have faced investigations, lawsuits and criticism from patients over prices, which have been sharply climbing.But drugmakers argue growing rebates are part of the problem. Eli Lilly recently disclosed that it raised Humalog's list price 52% over five years, but due to growing rebates and discounts, the drug's net price fell 8% over the same period. Sanofi itself paid out 55% of its U.S. gross sales in the form of rebates last year, including $4.5 billion in mandated rebates to government payers and $7.3 billion in ""discretionary rebates."" To address the pricing criticism, Eli Lilly recently released an authorized generic to Humalog at a 50% discount to the branded version.",https://t.co/TadNpP1EIr,news
This service dog is trained to help his diabetic owner detect insulin levels,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video HARRISBURG, Pa. - For the past 8 years, Brenton Tague has had a walking buddy, his dog Peyton. Even though he's not always this cooperative, Tague can't complain; after all, Peyton is more than this man's best friend.""I actually found Peyton in West Virginia,"" Tague told WPMT. ""He's a Doberman/German Shepherd mix. He was actually getting prepped to get euthanized when I got my first email for Peyton at three months old. And then it was all history after that.""Tague was diagnosed with type one diabetes at 23 years old. Peyton, his service dog, knows if his blood sugar is low (below 70) or if it's extremely high.""So, he was trained using saliva,"" Tague said. ""That was a big one. So when I was going low, they would take saliva samples and train him to trigger towards that.""It took two years for Peyton to be fully trained using different smells, but now he alerts Brenton.""When he detects a low he'll actually lick my hands,"" Tague said. ""Like heavy licking. It's not just one lick, ya know, like a dog comes and licks your hands. He won't stop. Even in my sleep, he'll do it. He'll go to my face if I don't get up in my sleep.""And though Brenton has a continuous glucose monitor - or CGM - that gives him a constant reading of his blood sugar, the decision to get Peyton was really a safeguard for when he's sleeping; worried if he dropped too low and no one was there, WPMT reported.""As bad as it sounds, it allows me to be more aggressive with my insulin control,"" Tague said. ""Especially when I was living alone like when I would take insulin at night, I might not take as much as I would need to because I wouldn't want to go low during my sleep. Where if I know Peyton was there, I could take the insulin as needed because it wouldn't be as big of a concern for myself.""If a diabetic's blood sugar does drop too low, they can have a seizure, and in extreme cases, suffer brain damage that can lead to death. But Brenton is in control of his diabetes.""I'm not going to lie; I'm a dog person, so it's nice knowing that he's always there,"" Tague said. ""Any trip I go on he gets to go, he goes to work with me every day. It's just nice.""And a diabetic service dog's services don't stop there. Some dogs can even be trained to alert parents, if their child is high or low.The cost to train one of these dogs? Upwards of $30,000 dollars.The closest place to get a service dog trained in diabetes is in Chester County. For more information, visitÂ Canine Partners for Life.",https://t.co/K673qUeh2K,news

Infusion Set Supply Packs for t:slim X2 Insulin Pump,"Nothing makes us realize how quickly 2-3 days fly by like getting reminders from our son's t:slim X2™ insulin pump that he is due for an infusion set change. Every time we get the reminder, we are in disbelief that three days have already come and gone. We are a busy family, and there never seems to be a super convenient time to do infusion set changes. It always feels like site changes fall on some of our most hectic days.After years of doing them on the fly and collecting all supplies needed for a site change in the spur of the moment, I finally wisened up. I put together these supply packs with everything needed for a site change. Now when our son is due for a new site, we just grab a bag. It dramatically cut down on the time it takes to do a change. The packs are also super convenient for when we're traveling. We just grab a few and are ready to go.This system has also helped us immensely with keeping track of our supply inventory. Each time I make new packs, I assess how much of each item we have and proactively order more when inventory is low.To cut back on waste, I purchased reusable bags, and they are perfect for our site packs. I start by laying out the bags. I go through each item and lay it out on top of the bag. In each bag, I put an infusion set, a cartridge (+ syringe and fill needle), IV3000 transparent dressing (what we put over his infusion site to secure it), and five alcohol prep wipes per pack.Once I have everything laid out, I place it all inside the bag. I like to do it this way versus just initially putting everything in the bag, so that I get a chance to double check that each bag has everything needed.Once all bags are filled, I place them in a basket. I keep items like insulin, creams, and scissors (to cut the IV3000 dressing), in their own bag next to the basket. I grab that bag and a site pack each time we do a site change.This is a very simple system we've implemented, but one that we have found to be very convenient. It has tremendously helped make site changes more efficient.I was compensated by Tandem Diabetes Care for my contribution on this topic.

Apparel Designed by Gabelli School Student Makes Life Easier for Diabetics,"For Corinne Logan, getting fitted for an insulin pump to manage her Type 1 diabetes was life changing—the pump meant greater freedom, eliminating the need to plan days around injections, finger-sticks, or the number of carbohydrates she needed to eat.But having a bulky contraption attached to her hip was cumbersome for an athlete like Logan. So, she did what any innovator would do: she made her own solution.Corinne Logan, a Gabelli School of Business junior and the creator of PumpstashLogan, a rising junior at the Gabelli School of Business, is the founder of Pumpstash, LLC, a company that creates spandex shorts for women and girls with Type 1 diabetes who use an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor.The shorts are fitted with pockets that keep the pump securely in place so that athletic apparel or skirts and dresses can be worn unimpeded.The idea came to Logan while playing for her high school lacrosse team. During games and practice, her insulin pump would frequently get loose and bounce around.""There were some options keep it attached, such as fanny packs or arm or thigh pouches—but nothing that would either stay in place or that me as a 16-year-old girl would be caught dead in,"" said Logan, a business administration major with a minor in sustainable business. ""I started to take it off during practice and games, but that wasn't good for my numbers.""Inspired by a pair of running pants that had a pocket to store keys, Logan wondered whether she could combine the sturdiness of her spandex lacrosse shorts with the convenience of a pocket.She and her mom produced some sketches and took their design to a seamstress, who created the prototype. The Pumpstash shorts were born.At Fordham, Logan took idea to the next level with a Compass Fellowship, a program to help first-year undergraduate students start a social venture. The following year she was accepted into the Fordham Foundry, which helped her turn her venture into her own company.Logan is raising money through a Kickstarter campaign to fund the manufacturing process and get Pumpstash shorts onto the market.""The Foundry has been a huge help and support system,"" she said. ""It's a great community, because everyone has their own thing and their own expertise, so we're not competing against one another. Everyone wants everyone else to succeed.""The shorts are 79 percent polyester and 21 percent spandex and are made with antibacterial and wicking properties. A pocket in the back—which is made from a stronger material, 80 percent nylon and 20 percent spandex—keeps the pump secure, while a pocket in the front provides storage for ordinary objects such as keys or a cell phone. Ten percent of the profits from each pair sold is donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.It is important to continue funding research toward an eventual cure, Logan said. In the meantime, there are steps that can be taken to improve the quality of life for diabetics.""Depending on how you look at it, I'm lucky or unlucky because I've never known life without it. It's basically second nature to me,"" she said. ""But it can be really frustrating, especially if you're in a situation that's not a daily routine.""Having that insider's view of living with diabetes is at the heart of Pumpstash, Logan said, and is what drives her business model.""It was important to me that this project be in the hands of someone dealing with [diabetes], rather than a bigger company. A big company isn't necessarily thinking of little inconveniences that aren't medically problematic but which could be fixed to make day-to-day life easier.""",https://t.co/q2s3uBj13e,news
Why I Am Stockpiling Insulin in My Fridge,"What I didn't expect, what I still can't fathom, is that insulin prices would skyrocket so much. The price of my insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, with average costs per patient rising to nearly $6,000 a year. I definitely never thought that in 2019 there would be people who would die from lack of access. Many insulin-dependent people with diabetes in America, right now, even people with health insurance, are having financial trouble meeting their most basic need. I recently read about a nurse named Meaghan Carter, whose family said that she died when she lost her insurance in 2018, after she had lived with diabetes for more than 18 years. In 2017, a man from Houston died after his GoFundMe for insulin came up $50 short. GoFundMe yielded more than 8,000 results when I searched for ""insulin."" If my childhood impressions of the future were more sci-fi than realistic, then I never imagined the current state of diabetes management would be dystopic, with so many patients in our rich nation rationing their doses, trying to make little glass vials of life blood last as long as possible while drug companies make a hefty profit.Diabetics like me need insulin to process the sugar in our blood in order to live. With too little insulin to manage the food we eat, our blood sugars climb. I've struggled for years to describe what it feels like to have high blood sugar: All my energy is sapped away. I'm thirsty and sluggish, and my calves tend to cramp. It feels like a panic attack. I can never separate what high feels like from what anxious feels like because both feelings tend to develop together in a self-perpetuating ball, along with guilt. I feel guilty, whether the high is my ""fault"" or not (did I eat cake?), because I'm supposed to be in control of my disease, damn it. When I'm high, I inject insulin into my belly as quickly as possible and hope to find a nice place to rest while the insulin works its magic.That need for insulin takes center stage in my subconscious and many of my stress nightmares: My blood sugar is high but I can't find my insulin in my purse, my version of showing up naked to class for a test I didn't study for. I test my blood sugar and I get a result in the thousands (normal for me is around 100) and I try to fathom the ways in which my body will betray me. I'm a prisoner trapped on a plane without my insulin, feeling sicker and sicker, and I have to rely on Nicolas Cage to beat up some bad guys and find spare insulin to bring me. O.K., that's not a nightmare, that's the plot of the movie ""Con Air,"" but I certainly had a panic attack while seeing it with my parents as a teenager.",https://t.co/Q08rHWg8DG,news
"Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky talks 2020, Trump and her viral insulin video","Last week, Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois' 9th Congressional District was sitting at a House hearing about the price of insulin, telling pharmaceutical company leaders, ""If you think you can just out-talk us, without any transparency, without any accountability, I just want you to know your days are numbered.""By Thursday, she was at Annenberg Hall, recalling the incident at a Q&amp;A hosted by the Northwestern College Democrats.Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky talks to students about the rising price of insulin. Photo by Leslie Bonilla / North by NorthwesternShe admitted, ""Look out, your days are numbered — I don't even know what that means! That's how mad I was,"" to laughter from attendees.The average cost of insulin tripled from 2002 to 2013, according to a 2016 study by the Journal of the American Medical Association. Rising prices have led some diabetics to ration their insulin, sometimes with fatal consequences.In addition to taking on pharmaceutical companies, Schakowsky said that she wanted to ""protect"" and ""tweak"" the Affordable Care Act and extend comprehensive coverage to more people. She and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) introduced the Medicare for America Act last year, which would have implemented universal healthcare.""I think [Democrats] are on the right side of history on the agenda that we have,"" she said later.Schakowsky was optimistic for the party's chances in 2020. She said she was taking cues from her husband in hoping that President Donald Trump would not be remembered for his rhetoric, but instead for kicking off a ""progressive era.""""I'm living on that right now. I'm going with that.""However, Schakowsky hasn't committed to a 2020 presidential candidate yet.When talking about Joe Biden, who has not yet declared a run but has ranked high in the polls, she said that age was ""a factor."" Schakowsky acknowledged the physical impact of being president, referring to the before and after pictures that show former presidents going gray within a term.On Bernie Sanders, she was dismissive, saying, ""I'm not a Bernie person. I'll tell you that.""Still, winning was Schakowsky's first priority. She said that her only criterion was a viable campaign.While Schakowsky didn't fault voters who supported Trump in 2016, saying many likely saw candidate Hillary Clinton as ""more of the same,"" she was confident that some would change their mind by 2020.""Every day has been a betrayal of the needs of those people,"" she said. ""At least some of them are going to wake up and say, 'Wait a minute.'""Later, she said, ""I really do think we're going to win.""Weinberg senior and College Dems President Romie Drori, who had seen Schakowsky speak twice before, said she appreciated the congresswoman's frankness.""You don't get that a lot, just unadulterated opinions from politicians. And she consistently does that with us and engages with us honestly,"" Drori said. ""It's never patronizing or belittling. She really levels with us as college students.

CONNECTED SMART INSULIN PENS WILL RADICALLY IMPROVE CONVERSATIONS IN DIABETES CARE,"Connected smart pens will revolutionise diabetes care in the decade to come, and this upcoming revolution took a big leap this month, when the first of our valued partners within the digital health space, Glooko, released software in 23 countries in 14 different languages, that made both their in-clinic integrated diabetes management solution directed at healthcare professionals as well as their patient facing app (btw, download it today for iOS and Android), compatible with the Novo Nordisk range of connected durable smart devices. For Android based phones, you can upload directly via the phones NFC chip, while on iOS based devices, currently only visualisation of data is enabled at this point and upload is only supported via the in-clinic Glooko diasend box. The NovoPen® 6 and NovoPen Echo® Plus connected smart pens will be launched during 2019 and beyond. Whether to share the collected injection data is entirely in the hands (pun intended) of the person using the connected smart pens. If people choose to consent to share their data, the process is easy and seamless as shown below in the video, but we recognise that the data collected is the patient's data, not ours, and it is their choice. We, our partners and healthcare professionals need to continuously earn and re-earn the trust to see the data to help improve health for the people willing to share it. Only if people have trust, will they choose to put their pens to their phones to sync and/or bring their connected smart pens to the doctor to sync at the clinic before a consultation. While it may not be apparent to all today, in 2019, just how huge this will become and how big a shift the introduction of this new data source will be to the management of diabetes, over the next decade, it will. In Novo Nordisk, we look forward to see all our partners introduce this data set into their solutions during 2019 and beyond. So why does this matter you might ask yourself? and will this even make a difference for the treatment of diabetes? I strongly believe the answer is a resounding YES. CHANGING THE CONVERSATION BY INTRODUCING UNIQUE DATA THAT UNTIL NOW, DID NOT EXIST While it may seem odd, having access to valid, credible, complete, unbiased and passively collected data on how medication is taken is not available today. With the launch of connected smart pens that collect and store an accurate and complete log of when and how much medication was taken, we are on a path that will transform clinical practice. When the insulin injection data combined and correlated with other data sources, such as initially CGM/FGM/BGM, I believe it will be possible to close the loop in diabetes care and facilitate more productive and meaningful conversations between healthcare professionals and people living with diabetes. IS IT REALLY NEEDED? IMPROVING OUTCOMES BY ADDRESSING MEDICATION ADHERENCE I have yet to meet anyone with a diabetes who didn't want to have their diabetes well-controlled. I don't think such a person exist. So why is adherence to medication not 100% in the real world? I think we all instinctively know why when we look at our own lives. I often tell the story of my lower pain back problem, where I went to a physiotherapist to get it resolved. I hoped he would give me a nice massage and then be done with it, but that did not happen. Instead, he gave a a set of exercises I had to do, where I should arch my back, back and forth, 10 times, 5 times a day. ""Easy"" he said, ""as you work in an office. Just stand up and do the exercises. it just takes 30 seconds each time"". 3 weeks later when I went back and he asked ""so have you done your exercises?"" I replied ""well not all. Perhaps 80% or so"", which was untrue - it was more likely 20%, and only the first week. This is unfortunate for me and him as we ended of discussing what to do based on a completely inaccurate basis and he may think the exercises did not address my problem and think ""what is then wrong"", when the actual problem is that I didn't do them. We didn't get to the root of the problem. I wish we had had the conversation where he said ""well Søren, the problem is that you didn't do your exercises. Is it because they are wrong for you? don't work for your schedule/life? Should we try something else that works better for how you live your life?"". There are many such examples in all our lives. How many do you think take vitamins everyday for a year without forgetting a single day? none! how many remember to brush their teeth twice daily for at least 2 mins every time you brush? and switch their toothbrush at least every three months? few.. if any - because sometimes other things gets in the way - even if we have the ambition to be compliant, life still gets in the way - sometimes. Talking about those times when we forget, when life gets in the way is good. If there are patterns in when we are not compliant where we need to be extra attentive to be compliant so we can avoid/mitigate/address for the future, this is would be beneficial. If those discussions take point of departure in our own lives and own actions? much better. So it is with people living with diabetes (a systematic review published in Diabetes Care for example is here). The first priority is the to live our lives, not manage our disease(s), so sometimes other things in our lives takes precedence over ensuring 100% compliance with a treatment regimen. And sometimes certain treatment regimens might just not be right with the way people live their lives. Therefore, with connected smart pens and data from glucose sensors and other data sources, we now have the possibility to ensure that healthcare professionals and people with diabetes can have more productive and meaningful discussions that take point of departure in how people live their lives, how they take their medication and what the health outcome is. An illustrative example of a foundation to have such conversations can be seen below. As connected smart pens become common place over the next decade, I strongly believe the conversations we have with our healthcare professionals will radically transform and improve. This is what has started this month for people living with diabetes and I am excited about this journey and hope you are to. #itisnotabouthteapp #betterconversations #diabetes #digitalhealth #takingpointofdepartureinactualbehavior #designforthebehavioryouwouldliketosee #adherence #compliance",https://t.co/R4kwJl4UbV,news
Orgenesis Inc plans study to confirm liver cells are suitable as a source for cell replacement therapy for insulin-dependent diabetics,"Inc (NASDAQ: ORGS), a developer of advanced cell therapies, announced Tuesday that it has received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to collect liver biopsies from patients at the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel.This is intended to move forward a study to confirm the suitability of liver cells for cell replacement therapy for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes as a result of pancreatectomy, where a portion of the pancreas is surgically removed to treat serious conditions. Unfortunately, diabetes after pancreatectomy results in lifelong insulin-dependence.The company said the collected liver cells are intended to be bio-banked for potential future clinical use.""We believe that this IRB approval is a significant milestone in our product development process as we prepare to commence a key study, which is intended to confirm the suitability of patients' liver cells to be used as a personalized cell replacement therapy,"" said Dr Efrat Assa-Kunik, general manager at Limited.Study will kick off in MayDuring the study, liver samples will be collected and then processed and stored in specialized, clinical grade tissue banks for potential clinical use. The study will enroll 20 patients and start next month.The propagated cells will be maintained in a tissue bank and be utilized in a future clinical study, in which the cells will be transdifferentiated and administered back to the patients as a potential treatment.This personalized autologous process will be performed under the company's Autologous Point of Care (POCare) model, said the company, in which the patient liver samples are processed, cryopreserved and potentially re-injected, all in the medical center, under clinical grade/GMP level conditions.Transdifferentiation platform technologyOrgenesis is a pioneer in transdifferentiation, which involves direct reprogramming of an adult tissue or cell into another type of specialized cell with its distinct function. Transdifferentiation potentially provides the use of a patient's own adult tissues to restore any damaged organs or tissue.Orgenesis has further developed the science by licensing technology from the Tel Hashomer Medical Research Infrastructure and Services, utilizing liver cells as a source for Autologous Insulin Producing Cells as replacement therapy for islet transplantation. Theses insulin producing cells are derived from liver cells that are taken from the patient liver to be treated and then converted into functional glucose-regulated induced pluripotent stem cells (IPCs) and returned to the patient via injection. The therapy has the potential to provide long-term treatment.Orgenesis founder and chief scientific officer Professor Sarah Ferber is the inventor of the company's groundbreaking transdifferentiation platform technology.""We believe that this key study, our first human trial, will allow us to better understand the autologous immune response following AIP cell implantation in different patient populations (autoimmune or not), ex-vivo and in-vivo, as well as the potency of transdifferentiation as a novel precision medicine platform to predict treatment success,"" said Professor Ferber.Converting a diabetic's own tissue into insulin-producing cells has the potential to provide a cure for insulin dependence and overcoming donor shortages, costs and risks involved with transplant rejection.Professor Shehadeh from the Rambam Medical Center is the study's principal investigator, and says the ""breakthrough technology"" could provide patients with a potential cure that could ""dramatically improve"" their quality of life. ""Based on the outcome of this study, our goal is to utilize these cells in a future clinical phase I/IIa study, in which the cryopreserved cells would be administered back to the patient,"" said Dr Efrat Assa-Kunik. ""If successful, we believe that both of these studies could represent major milestones for the company and, most importantly, could be transformative for patients worldwide.""Contact Uttara Choudhury at [email protected]Follow her on : @UttaraProactive",https://t.co/zYCSlJDdNE,news
"Hacking risk leads to recall of 500,000 pacemakers due to patient death fears","Almost half a million pacemakers have been recalled by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to fears that their lax cybersecurity could be hacked to run the batteries down or even alter the patient's heartbeat.The recall won't see the pacemakers removed, which would be an invasive and dangerous medical procedure for the 465,000 people who have them implanted: instead, the manufacturer has issued a firmware update which will be applied by medical staff to patch the security holes.Six types of pacemaker, all made by healthtech firm Abbott and sold under the St Jude Medical brand, are affected by the recall. They are all radio-controlled implantable cardiac pacemakers, typically fitted to patients with slow or irregular heartbeats, as well as those recovering from heart failure.There have been no reports of unauthorised access to any patient's implanted device, according to Abbot. The FDA says that the vulnerability allows an unauthorised user to access a device using commercially available equipment and reprogram it. The hackers could then deliberately run the battery flat, or conduct ""administration of inappropriate pacing"". Both could, in the worst case, result in the death of an affected patient.The US Department of Homeland Security said that ""it is recommended that healthcare providers discuss this update with their patients and carefully consider the potential risk of a cybersecurity attack along with the risk of performing a firmware update"".Robert Ford, the executive vice president of medical devices at Abbott, said: ""All industries need to be constantly vigilant against unauthorised access. This isn't a static process, which is why we're working with others in the healthcare sector to ensure we're proactively addressing common topics to further advance the security of devices and systems.""It was the second round of updates for the heart implants that Abbott has announced since buying medical device maker St. Jude Medical earlier this year. The weaknesses were discovered by MedSec, a cybersecurity firm that specialises in researching vulnerabilities in the medical devices and healthcare industries. It's not the first weaknesses the company has found in St Jude Medical products, and it had previously been the target of a lawsuit from SJM for disclosing such vulnerabilities. This is the second round of updates for the heart implants issued by Abbott since it acquired SJM in January this year.MedSec hit headlines in 2016 for its unconventional approach to information security. On discovering flaws in St Jude Medical devices, it shared the information with an investment firm, Muddy Waters Capital, which then short-sold the stock, hoping to make money from the eventual financial hit the company would take when the issues were disclosed.""We acknowledge that our departure from traditional cybersecurity practices will draw criticism, but we believe this is the only way to spur St Jude Medical into action,"" the company's chief executive, Justine Bone, said at the time.In a statement, Abbott said ""The risk of hacking is extremely low – in fact, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that compromising the security of these devices would require a highly complex set of circumstances. The FDA and Abbott recommend that patients talk to their doctors during their next regularly scheduled visit about the firmware update.""",https://t.co/sxjFC4qZES,news
"Herbal Artichoke, The Best For the Treatment of Insulin Resistance (IR) in Patients with TCF7L2-rs7903146 Polymorphism","Scientists may have found a natural whole food for the treatment of insulin resistance with no side effects, according to studies.Insulin resistance is a syndrome in which the cells in your muscles, fat, and liver do not respond well to insulin produced by the pancreas in converting glucose to energy, leading to high levels of sugar in the blood.The causes of insulin resistance may be associated with the clogged up of the insulin receptor site that binds to insulin and passes its message to the cell.Insulin resistance is a hallmark of diabetes.Prediabetes is a term used to indicate a high level of blood glucose levels is higher compared to the normal range but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.The increase in age, family history, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and abnormal waist-hip ratio are some prevalent risk factor of insulin resistance.Interestingly, in the concern of long-term use of certain medication in the risk of insulin resistance such as glucocorticoids, antipsychotic, researchers at the Monell Chemical Senses Center,wrote, ""Atypical antipsychotic (AAP) medications that have revolutionized the treatment of mental illness have become stigmatized by metabolic side effects, including obesity and diabetes""And, ""olanzapine, an AAP highly associated with weight gain, causes significant elevations in postprandial insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon coincident with insulin resistance compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, an AAP considered metabolically sparing, induces insulin resistance but has no effect on postprandial hormones"".The doctor team continued, ""Importantly, the metabolic changes occur in the absence of weight gain, increases in food intake and hunger, or psychiatric disease"".The findings suggested that if you are taking a certain medication for the treatment of anxiety, please make sure you discuss the side effects with your doctor for preventive measure.Artichoke is a perennial thistle of Cynara cardunculus species of the Cynara genus, belonging to the family Carduoideae native to Southern Europe around the Mediterranean.The herbal plant has been used in traditional medicine as a liver protective and detoxified agent, and to treat digestive disorders, abdominal pain gas and bloating, etc.Researchers on finding a natural compound for the treatment of insulin resistance examined the effects of ALE supplementation on metabolic parameters of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS).The double-blind clinical trial included 80 patients with MetS in Sina Clinic, Khoy, Iran. randomly assigned to ALE or placebo groups to receive either ALE (1800 mg/d as four tablets) or matching placebo for 12 weeks.According to the anthropometric indices, blood pressure, glucose and lipid profile levels measured before and after the study, injection of ALE supplementation decreased insulin level and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in patients with the TT genotype of TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism (P &lt; 0.05).The finding strongly suggested that artichoke extract inhibited the expression of insulin resistance in a 12 weeks study in patients with the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism.In order to reveal more information about artichoke extract anti-insulin resistance, researchers once again investigated the effects of ALE supplementation on metabolic parameters in women with MetS.This study included a total of 50 women (aged 20-50 years) with MetS were randomly allocated into the two groups. with the ""ALE group"" (received 1,800 mg hydroalcoholic extract of artichoke as four tablets per day) and the ""placebo group"" (received placebo consisted of cornstarch, lactose, and avicel as four tablets per day) for 12 weeks.Surprisingly, in the carriers of A allele of the FTO-rs9939609, ALE supplementation showed a statistically significant decrease in serum triglyceride level compared with placebo without affecting the insulin parameter.The results strongly suggested that ALE inhibited the insulin resistance selectively only on patients with the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism.Taken altogether, artichoke may be considered a functional remedy for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance in carriers of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism, pending to the results of larger sample size and multicenter human study.Natural Medicine for Fatty Liver And Obesity Reversal - The Revolutionary Findings To Achieve Optimal Health And Lose WeightHow To Get Rid Of Eye Floaters Contrary To Professionals Prediction, Floaters Can Be Cured Naturally Ovarian Cysts And PCOS EliminationHolistic System In Existence That Will Show You How ToPermanently Eliminate All Types of Ovarian Cysts Within 2 MonthsBack to Kyle J.

#everesting19 - The Final Push!,"This time last year, I was battling headwinds, heat and severe dehydration on my way to Coolgardie. I took a risk and it backfired, but one which taught me never to take the same kind of risk again. I chose from that moment forward to accept my mistakes, to make myself accountable and to never give up. It's safe to say that for the remainder of the 4011 kilometre journey riding solo and unsupported from Perth to Sydney, I never ran out of water again and most of all, despite the barrage of challenges that happened after, I never ever gave up! On Saturday I'm setting out to do something I've always had ambitions to do, but that I've never come close to attempting before. Cycling 240 kilometres inside of a day is challenging enough for the avid cyclist, but the sheer concept of doing that mostly uphill at a gradient of around 8% just feels like insanity. Everesting, or as I have named my campaign #everesting19 will be the toughest single day challenge by far, that I've ever attempted. Even the 3000 odd metres I climbed in the blue mountains last year pales in comparison, but was an important yard stick for what might be possible after 19 days of cycling and almost 3800 kilometres in my legs. But I've been here before. The same lessons apply. I know all about hydration, but most of all, I know to never give up! Amidst all of the potential suffering, when I'm deep inside of my own mind, that's where the fight to make the seemingly impossible, possible, happens. It doesn't come from the fancy equipment, the meticulous nutritional plan or the magically brutal training program, it comes from within. It will take nothing short of an injury to stop me, but everything short of giving up to make it a reality. I have of course had my fair share of challenges this last 12 months, but those are excuses I leave simply no room for on the starting line this Saturday.My struggles seem to pale in comparison to those I am seeking to help the most. Those that suffer in what seems like relative silence whilst the developed world continues to focus on materialism and wealth, who pay the ultimate price of having been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes without access to proper medicine, insulin and healthcare required to save them. It breaks my heart that we allow this to happen. It fills me with anger, pushes me harder and motivates me more than ever to make a difference, no matter how small. Who am I to complain about the stains on my couch as I lay down to recover from the effects of a hypo, when someone else is barely able to meet their basic needs, test, dose and in most circumstances where having a hypo is unquestionably the furthest from their reality. This isn't a fictional tale, but the truth and state of reality in a world where access to insulin, a basic human right, does not apply to all, or at least applies if you are lucky enough to be born into a particular set of circumstances. We need to do something. That's why I am raising funds as part of my mission. As part of this campaign where I set out to slaughter myself for more than 16 hours. I am cycling every lap with a country who suffers in this crisis in mind. I am raising funds for Insulin For Life. Help me to help them by donating here https://www.mycause.com.au/events/everestingforlifeMarch 30th is a little over 48 hours away and this will be my last blog post until after the fact. Lets make these 40 incredibly difficult laps count. Let's change how we look at the world with type 1 diabetes. I've always been a firm believer in actions speaking far louder than words. These are my actions and let's make them speak loud and clear that we are changing diabetes!For anyone living in Perth who wants to come along in support, that would be amazing.

Hope for diabetics as scientists turn stem cells into ones that can produce insulin,"Stem cells have been turned into insulin-producing cells in a medical breakthrough for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.Researchers have for years tried to figure out how to make the transformation in the hope of helping millions battling the condition.Now, they created functioning healthy beta cells - which are destroyed in a type 1 diabetic's body - in a petri dish. After transplanting them into mice, the cells began to produce insulin and respond to blood sugar within days. It has the potential of 'finally finding a cure' to type 1 diabetes, which strikes around 1.25million in the US and 400,000 in Britain. Scientists believe they may 'finally find a cure' for type 1 diabetics after managing to create functioning healthy beta cells from stem cells, which produced insulin in mice Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin due to the immune system attacking the cells.In a small number of cases, diabetics can have a pancreas transplant but there is limited availability.Transplants of just the pancreatic 'islets' – clusters of cells containing healthy beta cells – are currently in clinical trials, but still rely on pancreases from deceased donors. Therefore, scientists have been working to figure out how to program stem cells into functioning beta cells for years - but have faced obstacles. WHAT IS A PANCREAS OR ISLET TRANSPLANT? A pancreas transplant is usually only considered in a small number of cases of people with type 1 diabetes.There are around a million people in the UK with type 1 diabetes, but only about 200 get a pancreas transplant each year.Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the cells (islets) in the pancreas that produce a hormone called insulin.It can often be controlled with insulin injections, so the risks of a pancreas transplant outweigh the benefits in many cases.It may be several months, or possibly years, before a suitable donor pancreas becomes available.In the UK, half of the people waiting for a pancreas transplant will have had one by around 13 months.A small number of people with type 1 diabetes may have a slightly different procedure, called islet transplantation, where only the cells that produce insulin (islet cells) are transplanted from a donor pancreas into the liver. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted through your tummy and liver, into the vein that supplies the liver with blood. The donor islet cells are then injected into it.If the procedure is successful, the donor cells will start making insulin. This can help people who experience severe episodes of a dangerously low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia) that occur without warning.Insulin treatment is often still needed after the operation, but the episodes of hypoglycaemia should be easier to control.Source: NHS Dr Matthias Hebrok, senior author of the study at University of California San Francisco (UCSF), said: 'The cells we and others were producing were getting stuck at an immature stage where they weren't able to respond adequately to blood glucose and secrete insulin properly. 'It has been a major bottleneck for the field.'The team, led by Dr Gopika Nair, instead looked at the physical process by which the cells separate from the rest of the pancreas and form the so-called islets of Langerhans.It was the formation of this islet that appeared to be important, rather than the individual cells themselves. Dr Nair said: 'A key principle in biology is that form follows function, so we reasoned that the formation of islets might be an important process for beta cells to mature properly.'The researchers replicated the process in lab dishes by artificially separating partially differentiated pancreatic stem cells.They then reformed them into islet-like clusters and the cells' development suddenly leapt forward.The researchers then transplanted these lab-grown 'islets' into healthy mice and found that they were functional in three days and produced insulin in response to blood sugar.Dr Hebrok said: 'We can now generate insulin-producing cells that look and act a lot like the pancreatic beta cells you and I have in our bodies. 'This is a critical step towards our goal of creating cells that could be transplanted into patients with diabetes.'The findings, published in Nature Cell Biology, shed hope on new treatments for diabetics that don't rely on donors.Dr Nair said: 'Current therapeutics like insulin injections only treat the symptoms of the disease. Our work points to several exciting avenues to finally finding a cure.'Diabetics can manage their disease, but are at risk of serious health complications including kidney failure, heart disease and stroke.Patients may be eligible for a pancreas transplant from a deceased donor if they also have severe kidney disease, or if they have severe episodes of a dangerously low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia) that occur without warning, in spite of good insulin control. But transplants are rare and the waiting list is a long time - only about 1,000 US type 1 diabetics get pancreas transplants in any given year, and 200 in the UK. The procedure is also very risky, and recipients must take immune-suppressing drugs for life, which can put them at greater risk of infection. Dr Hebrok said: 'We're finally able to move forward on a number of different fronts that were previously closed to us. The possibilities seem endless.'",https://t.co/Mpx1X7jpzs,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/i1rWz46glj,news
Pittsburgh diabetics traveling to Canada to buy insulin,"0 Pittsburgh diabetics traveling to Canada to buy insulin A poll this month found nearly eighty percent of Americans find drug prices unreasonable. In February, 11 Investigates looked into the rising price of insulin and the potentially deadly results of that increase. Now, we followed some of those Pittsburgh diabetics over the border to see how driving across one bridge can change everything. The journey is not a short one. It takes 250 miles, up Interstate 79 and along Lake Erie to reach the Rainbow Bridge. The drive across that bridge into Canada means saving hundreds of dollars on something they all need to survive. ""You're in Canada and all of a sudden insulin is a lot cheaper,"" said Type 1 Diabetic Lauren Granata. Our border crossing agent told us he's seen several US citizens on the same journey into Canada to save hundreds of dollars on their insulin. We spoke to one of the Pittsburghers right after he paid for three vials of his insulin for about $90 U.S. without a prescription. He usually would pay $285 for just one vial in the US. TRENDING NOW: ""It doesn't make sense that we have to do it the way we do back home,"" said Brent Garner. At a second pharmacy, it was the same story. This time, Granata was able to find her insulin for about a quarter of the US cost. ""There's people that legitimately die because they can't afford this and I can drive across the border and buy this for $100,"" she told 11 Investigates. ""And it keeps me alive."" Just this week, insulin maker Eli Lilly shed light on its confidential drug pricing for Humalog. It said the net price patients pay after rebates and discounts actually dropped eight percent from 2014. Meanwhile, the average list price rose 52 percent in that time to about $600 per patient each month. People without insurance could be forced to pay outright and quickly find themselves with mounting bills. Eli Lilly also announced a cheaper generic this month, but the group we talked to wasn't impressed, calling the announcement a Band-Aid. ""They need to do what's right and they need to make it one price everywhere in the world,"" Granata said. The FDA warns against importing drugs because it ""cannot ensure the safety and effectiveness"" of the drugs. Our group said they were able to buy the exact same insulin they would purchase in the United States. The Senate Finance Committee has launched an investigation into rising insulin prices. President Donald Trump has made lowering drug prices a key goal of his administration. Until that happens, these friends are prepared to make this drive again. ""Legally you can bring a 3 month supply across the border, so if I have to do this once every three months, I have to do it once every three months,"" Granata said. We looked into why the price difference exists. It comes down to negotiating power. In the US, Medicare can't negotiate drug prices. Canada has a drug review board that compares drug effectiveness relative to other products on the market. That board can turn down expensive drugs if they outprice a good alternative. That can drive companies to lower prices to remain competitive. A study published in BMJ Global Health last year estimated the cost of production of a vial of insulin at less than $4. Insulin makers say that doesn't factor in the cost of research, quality testing, distribution and company growth. © 2019 Cox Media Group.",https://t.co/spqNsUWvWS,news
"Plant-based diet increases secretion of insulin, incretin hormones in people with type 2 diabetes","A plant-based diet improves the secretion of insulin and incretin hormones in those with type 2 diabetes, according to new research published in Nutrients.Researchers compared the effects of a plant-based meal to a meal containing meat on the hormone levels of a group of 20 men who have type 2 diabetes in a randomized crossover trial. The meals consisted of either a tofu-based veggie burger or a meat-based burger and contained the same amount of calories and ratio of macronutrients.The results show that participants' postprandial secretion of insulin increased more after the plant-based meal than the meat-based meal. Secretion of incretin hormones, particularly glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), also increased more after the vegan meal. Incretin hormones amplify the release of insulin after a meal and also help decrease blood glucose levels.Beta-cell function parameters also improved after the vegan meal. Beta cells synthesize, store, and release insulin. Beta-cell function is typically diminished in those who have diabetes, and preserving beta cells' capacity to produce insulin is a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes.""With diabetes rates rising and insulin costs soaring, this study offers hope that a solution could be close at hand: the food on our plates,"" says study author Hana Kahleova, M.D., Ph.D., director of clinical research at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. ""The results add to the evidence that a plant-based diet should be considered a frontline treatment for type 2 diabetes.""A previous study found that a 16-week plant-based dietary intervention improves insulin resistance and beta-cell function in overweight adults. Other studies have shown that plant-based diets are effective in managing and even reversing type 2 diabetes and that those following a plant-based diet have approximately half the risk of developing diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians.In the United States today, more than 114 million adults have either diabetes or prediabetes.

T1International Statement on Walmart Insulin,"Recently, the American Diabetes Association issued a white paper on Insulin Access and Affordability by their Working Group. While we continue to applaud the American Diabetes Association for speaking out about the high cost of insulin, we remain concerned with their approach and some of the recommendations in their paper. T1International was alarmed to find multiple suggestions that American doctors should prescribe older, cheaper human insulins like R and NPH to help solve the price crisis. This type of rhetoric will likely encourage medical professionals and health insurers to justify prescribing and covering the insulins that are less effective for many.We have recently seen an increase in the push for 'Walmart insulin' in the US as a solution for the insulin crisis. This has been at the same time as increased media coverage of the crisis and greater demands for legislative action by the public. People should know that ReliOn R and ReliOn N (sometimes known as Regular and NPH) insulins cost $25 in many states and they are an option in emergency situations. This type of insulin is obviously better than no insulin at all, but we repeat that it is not a solution to the insulin affordability crisis.People with diabetes must consult a doctor before attempting to change to this type of insulin which reacts very differently – and more unpredictably – than analog insulin. This unpredictability means that a person would need to afford additional blood glucose testing strips. Someone without insurance will not be able to afford the strips and other supplies needed, nor the doctor visits for the support that is essential when switching to this insulin. Twenty-five dollars per vial is not an affordable price for everyone. The ADA's suggestion that prescribing this insulin should become a common money-saving practice also exacerbates a two-tiered system where the rich get the 'better insulin' and the poor are forced to use the older, and often more problematic, insulin. Finally, the paper mentions the need for more transparency, but offers no suggestions of how that should happen. This is incredibly frustrating for people living with diabetes because there has been legislative movement on the state-level towards transparency, but we have seen insufficient support from the ADA.This deadly crisis needs action now. Solutions proposed must address the prices set by Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi. Care for people living with diabetes in the USA cannot be compromised because of pharma's greed. We continue to request that T1International have the opportunity to share our experience and expertise with the ADA so that we can put patients first and join efforts in the fight for #insulin4all.",https://t.co/l4d55fpYZg,news

Diabettech - Diabetes and Technology,"After running with the FreeStyle Libre with the MiaoMiao as a CGM system for two weeks, I've drawn some conclusions from use, although there's a world of work to do to extract the data from NightScout and generate some real analysis.Firstly though, let's be clear on what the experiment was. As I discussed here, my first 5 days didn't generate the type of results that I expected to see, as both the OOP algorithm and the xDrip algorithm weren't keeping up with the Dexcom G6, which in and of its own, wasn't really performing as well as I'd normally expect.So, like any good experiment, just to be sure that the result wasn't skewed by the specific sensors, once we got to 7 days, I switched the two over.For the first 7 days, sensor A ran the xDrip algorithm and sensor B ran the OOP algorithm, while for the second seven days, sensor A ran the OOP algorithm and sensor B ran the xDrip algorithm.So let's have a look at what happened following the last update on this topic.In a single photo, you can see the typical state of affairs, where typically, xDrip would be higher than the calibration value, OOP would be lower than the calibration value and G6 would be thereabouts the calibration value. Of course that wasn't always the case, and there were times where the G6 was off by more than either Libre, but those were relatively few.Switching algorithms aroundWhat happened when we switched between the two algorithms?Firstly, swapping from xDrip algorithm to OOP algorithm.Swapping from xDrip to OOPYou can see, right in the middle of the image, what happened when we swapped the algorithms over. An instant drop of around 1mmol/l.If we look at what happened on the other one, where we swapped from OOP to xDrip, it jumped the other way, by a greater amount.Swapping from OOP to xDripWith this one, however, we can clearly see where the blood was (note the square point means it was simply a test, and not a calibration).So in both, on the switch over, we can see a very clear break in the way the two algorithms read the data. As we'd been using the OOP algorithm, which can't be calibrated, the jump was simply the reading of the native values.General TrendsWhat this helps to demonstrate was the general trend, which was that for me, while the OOP algorithm generally ran low, the xDrip algorithm generally ran high. This wasn't always the case, as the picture below demonstrates, but for a large part of the usage time, that's what I observed.G6 running furthest from bloodThis image certainly makes it look like the OOP algorithm picked up the low first, but as we identified in the first tranche of this review, the G6 generally picked up changes fastest.Comparing three systems (1)Here we can see the three systems all close to one another, but for once, the xDrip algorithm was reading lower than the OOP algorithm, while the G6 was right on the button with the bloods.Comparing three systems (2)If we look at the second of these two images (colours are for the same systems), we can see a very different response, Where in this case, the xDrip algorithm seems to have interpreted the changes in data points much less than either the OOP algorithm or the G6 algorithm. What the second image also highlights is that the G6 is already picking up the uptick that hasn't yet shown on either Libre algorithm. You'll note that there is an earlier calibration where all systems are relatively similar in numbers and as the morning progressed in the this second image, xDrip and G6 drifted apart, which was a common occurrence. Calibration and subsequent tracesSimilarly in the above image, you can see the variability across the three algorithms. I could go on, but my experience with the Libre and two MiaoMiaos was consistent on two different phones having switched the algorithms over at the midpoint.Clear variation between the three algorithms over 24 hoursAs the above picture shows, it was possible to get quite different data from all three systems, so you need to know just what you are looking at.But one of the interesting observations is that when you look at what the native LibreLink reading was, versus what the calibrated xDrip value was, often, the xDrip value was significantly more realistic.I think the graphs generally back this up, as in most cases, the OOP value was a lot lower than the xDrip calibrated one.And of course, one shouldn't forget the other fun thing with Libre. How do you get on with the adhesive. Now, both the MiaoMiaos and the Libres stayed stuck with no additional tape for the duration of the two week test, but as you can see below, the ""Libre Kiss"" marks were forming…TakeawaysWhat I haven't done here is produce a MARD, or anything similar from the data. I don't think that would be a fair reflection on this setup, as from many accounts I've heard, people see reasonable closeness to bloods with the xDrip calibrated Libre using MiaoMiao.What I hoped to illustrate is that people using this set-up should be aware of what they are using and understand the limitations and potential pitfalls with it.In all the Dexcom implementations of xDrip+ and Spike, you are getting a normalised data point, which has already taken vagiaries relating to temperature, etc, into account. Raw is not raw. In the Libre, you are acting on a data value that is completely raw and doesn't have the additional normalisation applied.The reason I swapped the two algorithms over in the middle of the sensor lives was to see whether there was variance across the outputs of the two sensors. If one had been reading slightly differently to the other, then the results with xDrip's calibration might have been different. What the swap shows is that for me, the two Libres were acting consistently and that the xDrip algorithm generally produced a value that was quite a long way from the actual blood reading (with the caveats already mentioned). Sometimes higher (as in the first five days of testing) and sometimes lower, as many of the examples here show.While lower is better for looping, higher does increase the risk of too much insulin being delivered, so if you are using the Libre with MiaoMiao or Bluecon, you do need to be aware of the potential risks associated with this approach.There is still a piece of work to be done to compare the data from the algorithms by extracting it from the NightScout database and performing further analysis, however, that's going to take a little time.I think the key outcome for me with this trial was that xDrip (and I assume, Spike) does improve the accuracy of the output from the Libre in general, when used with the MiaoMiao, but I wouldn't rely on it (as I wouldn't rely on the Libre scans) for dosing insulin.It's an enhancement, but for me, it's not a replacement for an uncalibrated G6, which seems to do the job a whole lot better.***Note***Thanks to Alasdair McLay and Kamil Armacki (Nerdabetic) for the loan of the two Miao Miao transmitters.Like this:Like Loading...Related",https://t.co/kvPvz1Z8m2,news
'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved.

Why Walmart Insulins Aren't the Answer to High Insulin Prices,"CommentarySome people don't understand why people with diabetes get upset at the price of insulin. They see insulin for sale at a relatively reasonable price in Walmart and don't see the problem. What they don't know is that these Walmart insulins just don't perform nearly as well as the more expensive insulins, and that gap in performance can have a very negative effect on the health of people with diabetes.There are three insulins available at Walmart for the price of $25 – NPH, Regular, and 70/30 (a mix of the two). NPH was first approved by the FDA in 1950, Regular was approved in 1982, 70/30 in 1989. That means NPH has been around for 66 years, Regular for 33 years, 70/30 for 27 years.Take a moment and think about what healthcare was like in 1950.Now, I'm sure someone is saying, ""Well, they must still work if they are still being sold."" And they do, but they don't work in the same way. These insulins are not interchangeable.If a person with Type 1 diabetes were to switch from a Humalog/Lantus insulin regimen to Regular and NPH, it would drastically alter their lifestyle, making blood sugar control more irregular and raising A1C scores.The biggest issue is that whereas Lantus is steady, NPH peaks. A person using NPH must keep a very set dietary schedule, making sure to eat meals and snacks at certain times to correspond with peak times of an insulin dose.The strict schedule is difficult for everyone, but especially for children. They are unable to alter their daily schedules and must always be sure to eat at specific times. Even if they're not hungry, they must eat to avoid low blood sugar. And if they are hungry, they often cannot have more than the required amount.Quite frankly, this sucks. When my child was first diagnosed, she was on NPH. It was incredibly difficult to limit a growing child's diet to such a strict schedule. Here's what it looked like:8 a.m.- 45-carb meal10:30 a.m. – 15-carb snack12 p.m. – 45-carb meal2 p.m. – 15-carb snack5 p.m. – 45-carb meal7:30 p.m. – 15-20 carb snack before bed to keep blood sugar up overnight.I cannot tell you how many times my child refused to eat the 45 carbs in her dinner. There is something wrong when you are fussing at your 5-year-old to stop eating her green beans and to eat her bread, or mashed potatoes, or pasta.[adrotate banner=""58″]She also was eating dinner between an hour and an hour and a half before the normal family dinner because her insulin required it; her father wasn't even home yet. And she was unable to have cake at a birthday party because she couldn't deviate from her schedule. We switched to Lantus as soon as we could.We have always used Humalog for meal-time insulin and for correcting high glucose levels in a timely manner. The closest comparison to this insulin that Walmart sells is Regular. This insulin is not a rapid-acting insulin, but a short-acting insulin; the two aren't the same. Where Humalog and Novalog begin lowering glucose levels within 15 minutes, Regular insulin can take up to an hour to alter glucose levels.Because Regular has such a delayed response time, a person must inject insulin for meals an hour before they eat. Going out to dinner? You must decide on your meal before you leave the house. If you're hungry for a snack, you must bolus the insulin and then wait an hour. This also means that a correction dose for high blood sugar has delayed results.And then there's the issue of duration. Humalog and Novalog burn off within four to five hours, while Regular remains in the system for eight to 10 hours. At eight hours, all the food that the Regular covered is long gone.All of these factors affect quality of life and the regulation of blood sugar levels, and up the risk of hypoglycemia. It's not impossible to stay healthy using Walmart insulins, but it is more difficult and requires a very strict adherence to dietary regimen and schedules.So, yes, Walmart sells twenty-five-dollar insulin. It can save you money today, but it can result in higher costs and poorer health in the long run. These insulins are not the answer to the rapid rise in prices for more popular insulins.Editor's Note – This article was excerpted by permission from a longer and more detailed Facebook post about the rapid rise in insulin prices.

"Eli Lilly Will Sell Half-Price Version of Humalog, Its Popular Insulin","Outrage over the cost of insulin has driven much of the political conversation about high drug prices, with reports of patients dying because they could not afford it.In February, the Senate Finance Committee sent Lilly a letter asking for more information about how it sets prices for its insulin products, including Humalog. The letter noted that taxpayers spend more than $1 billion a year for Humalog through Medicare and Medicaid and said, ""When one insulin product costs the taxpayer more than $1 billion in one year, the American people ought to know how the company prices its product.""Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement Monday that the investigation into Lilly's insulin prices would continue. ""The company's decision to offer a generic version of a several decade old drug will be part of the investigation,"" he said.The story of insulin, many say, is a salient example of how the drug pricing system is broken. Over the years, industry intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers have negotiated ever-deeper discounts for insulin, yielding savings for the insurers and employers that pay the bulk of drug costs. Insulin manufacturers have responded by raising their list prices in an effort, they say, to please the benefit managers, who keep a percentage of the discounts they pass along.The list price of insulin has gone from about $20 per vial in 1996, when Humalog entered the market, to about $275 per vial today. Humalog patients typically use about two vials a month, Lilly said.The result is a yawning gap between the list price of insulin — which people who are uninsured must pay — and the net price that insurers and employers pay.Enrique A. Conterno, the president of Lilly's diabetes division, said Friday that the list price of the authorized generic will be comparable to the net price the company regularly offered to insurers in exchange for standard placement on their formulary, or the list of covered drugs, although he did not specify a dollar amount. But he said the company provided deeper discounts to insurers that give Humalog preferred treatment, which typically means lower out-of-pocket costs for patients.",https://t.co/tJRUfOoRuB,news
'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research.

GHFT - Independence with Insulin: Facilitating safe self-administration on Guiting Ward,"Background &amp; ProblemGuiting ward at Cheltenham General Hospital looks after patients needing vascular procedures. Many of these are diabetic patients who use insulin at home. When in hospital, these patients often want to continue self-administering their insulin and managing their condition as independently as possible. This should be encouraged, as self-administration of insulin is proven to result in better patient outcomes. However, patients should only be injecting themselves unsupervised if they are competent to do so. They should also be storing their insulin somewhere securely, in line with medication safety laws.Previously there was no formal process for assessing the competence of patients, and patients could not access their bedside lockers, meaning they either had to ask a nurse to retrieve their insulin or leave it out at the bedside. Patients were unhappy with this arrangement and it was unsafe to have insulin lying about.AimTo increase the number of patients appropriately self-administering insulin by 50% over 4 months.""Appropriately"" here means there is documented assessment of self-administration if needed and the insulin in use is stored securely.MethodChange 1: Ward staff education and reminder cards stuck to bedside lockers.Change 2: Introduction of Trust documentation to assess patients as well as a separate prescription chart, designed to be filled in by patient (2 x PDSA cycles).Change 3: Provision of lockable boxes, accessible to patients and to be kept at bedside, to keep insulin and equipment in (2 x PDSA cycles).The lockable bedside boxes were obtained from Bristol Maid, using a donation kindly gifted by Cheltenham and Gloucester Hospitals Charity.Huddles were held with the nursing staff to teach them about the new documentation and boxes.Data was collected daily during pharmacist ward visit and recorded on a proforma. Data was gathered through examination of the prescription chart and observation of patient bed space. The location of insulin in use was also recorded.ResultsThere was a clear increase in the number of patients appropriately self-administering (12% at baseline to 73%). There is now the means to assess patients wishing to self-administer insulin on the ward, and patient-accessible safe storage is available. Location of insulin in use saw an improvement - from just 58% of it being stored securely to 82% by the end of the project. There was a positive response by both patients and staff.The 50% target in the aim was achieved, though it was difficult to sustain. The project ran over the 4 months originally intended.ImplicationsThe project was an overall success, and it is hoped that the interventions made will become a permanent feature on the ward. The ward may require additional support and training, which will be determined over the next few months. Ward staff are likely to need continued encouragement in using the tools provided with confidence. If the project proves sustainable in the long term, it could act as a model for other areas of the hospital to introduce insulin self-administration.Quality Improvement Presenter(s)Harriet Dykes, Pharmacist, Cheltenham General HospitalQuality Improvement TeamElisabeth Willis, PharmacistRebecca Mustow, Medicines Management NurseNursing staff, Guiting wardGSQIA_Poster_-_Harriet_Dykes.",https://t.co/foJWLO6sbW,news
Eli Lilly discloses pricing data for its popular insulin Humalog,"A box of Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Humalog brand kwikpen insulin delivery devices are arranged for a photograph at a pharmacy in Princeton, Illinois.Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly pulled the curtain back on the confidential pricing structure for one of its blockbuster drugs Monday, disclosing for the first time what it charges wholesalers versus what many patients typically pay.The company's list prices for its popular insulin injection Humalog, versus what most patients are charged after insurance company rebates and other discounts, highlight the disparity in prices between uninsured and insured patients. The move is also a pre-emptive one as the Trump administration and Congress pressure drugmakers for more transparency and to lower drug costs.The ""net price "" patients actually pay for Eli Lilly's insulin fell by 8.1 percent to $135 a patient per month in 2018 from $147 in 2014, the company said in a shareholder report released Monday. The net price is the total paid after factoring in rebates and discounts. The insulin's average list price before the discounts rose 51.9 percent to $594 per patient each month. ""We believe that the additional information disclosed ... will provide greater transparency into the significant rebates and discounts we provide to payers and other supply chain entities for this important medicine,"" the company said in a statement to CNBC.The report comes after the Senate Finance Committee, led by Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., launched an investigation into rising insulin prices, writing to Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, asking them why the cost of the nearly 100-year-old medication had rapidly risen.High drug costs have become a rare bipartisan issue with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle demanding something be done. President Donald Trump has made lowering prices one of the key issues of his administration. Democrats are jockeying to prove they can lead reform.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than 30 million Americans have diabetes. The annual cost of insulin for people with Type 1 diabetes in the U.S. nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016 to $5,700 from $2,900.Drugmakers argue these prices are simply the price that's advertised, not what consumers actually pay. But people without insurance may be forced to pay upfront, sometimes leaving them with a mountain of debt.Drug companies have blamed pharmacy benefit managers, sometimes called middlemen, for the sticker shock some patients see at the counter. Drugmakers argue that PBMs should pass the rebates negotiated with manufactures along to patients.The Trump administration earlier this year proposed a rule to end the industry-wide system of rebates, a change that Lilly and other pharmaceutical companies welcomed.Earlier this month, Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a half-price version of Humalog. The rebranded product called Insulin Lispro would be $137.35 per vial. Humalog, which makes $3 billion in annual sales, will remain available, Eli Lilly said.Eli Lilly, with a market cap of more than more than $132 billion, has seen its share rise 67.7 percent over a 12-month period. The stock is up more than 10 percent this year.--Reuters contributed to this report.",https://t.co/u3ZfmUrrKs,news

'We were always hungry': U of T research links severe hunger at residential schools to today's health of Indigenous peoples,"The severe hunger and malnutrition that many Indigenous children suffered at Canadian residential schools have contributed to Indigenous peoples' elevated risk of obesity and diabetes, according to University of Toronto public health and anthropology researchers.""Hunger has always been central to survivors' accounts of their residential school experiences, and we strongly believe that this testimony must be taken more seriously by researchers and medical practitioners,"" said Ian Mosby, a food historian who is an adjunct lecturer at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health.Mosby and Tracey Galloway, an assistant professor of anthropology, at U of T Mississauga, published their findings in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. They found that for most of the history of the residential school system, Indigenous children were fed poor quality, often rotting food.Based on survivor testimony, they estimate that the typical diet described by survivors delivered, on average 1,000 to 1,450 calories a day, with moderately active children requiring between 1,400 and 3,200 calories a day.""We can now be fairly certain that the elevated risk of obesity, early-onset insulin resistance and diabetes observed among Indigenous peoples in Canada arises, in part at least, from the prolonged malnutrition experience by many residential school survivors,"" said Galloway.A lack of calories causes height stunting and a tendency to put on fat when calories are available, predisposing children to obesity, insulin-resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Improper nutrition also has reproductive effects, such as a higher risk of stillbirths, premature births and growth issues for babies.""The possibility that generations of health practitioners and researchers may have overlooked childhood malnutrition in residential schools as one of the most significant factors influencing Indigenous health in Canada should be a call to action,"" Mosby and Galloway write.They urge health-care practitioners to include more community-driven and culturally appropriate approaches that recognize trauma, to help residential school survivors and their families, and to ensure current and future generations of Indigenous children have access to nutritious and healthy traditional foods.Associate Professor Suzanne Stewart, director of Dalla Lana's Waakebiness-Bryce Institute for Indigenous Health, agrees this research should be a call to action.""Indigenous knowledges and research methods must be part of solutions to improve outcomes and close the gap in the health of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people,"" said Stewart.""Further, heath-care systems need to take responsibility for past harms not simply by acknowledging them but by taking a close and hard look at how research and policies continue to oppress and make ill Indigenous peoples.""",https://t.co/zhQ6CcrMRx,news

Throughout high school and the beginning of college,I would keep bringing it up with my family – could we, by any chance, do aEurope trip this year? When the answer was still ""probably not"" last fall, Idecided to take matters into my own hands – I was going to Europe all bymyself. I ran through several versions ofan itinerary, before finally settling on an eleven-day mad dash during mycollege's Spring Break. In those eleven days, I would be visiting eight cities– London, Oxford, Paris, Barcelona, York, Edinburgh, Dublin, and Reykjavik, inthat order – with visits stretching from three days in London to twenty hoursin Paris to three hours in York. One frenzy of ticket and hostel booking later,I was on my way to Europe on an overnight Norwegian Airways flight.I tried to pack as much as I could into those eleven days. Everymorning I would wake up early in my hostel or AirBnB, grab a hearty breakfastat a local restaurant or café, and walk or take public transportation into thecity. Even though I gave unrealistically small amounts of time to cities likeParis (20 hours) or Barcelona (26 hours), I still managed to visit all sorts oficonic attractions and landmarks – such as Buckingham Palace, MagdaleneCollege, Notre Dame, La Sagrada Familia, the British Railway Museum,Edinburgh's Royal Mile, and Trinity College. I enjoyed a beautiful night viewof Paris from the Eiffel tower where I ran into a man proposing to hisgirlfriend. I lost myself in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, where people crammedthemselves into tiny tapas bars to enjoy a drink, some delicious bites, andgood company. And when my eleven-day trip turned into twelve and I was (voluntarily)stuck in Iceland due to the now-defunct WOW Air overbooking my flight, Ienjoyed the long, northern sunset as I walked down to the beach in Reykjavik. I now realize this pictureis equal parts British and American…Magdalene College and localOxford wildlifeLa Sagrada Familia issimply other-worldly.Carlton Hill, Edinburgh –complete with my despicable attempt at a beard.Abandoned church-ish thingin Howth, IrelandDespite these wonderful perks, though, a solo trip like this is adaunting step into the wider world for anyone, and difficulties are bound topresent themselves. Traveling solo can sometimes be accompanied by losing yourwallet or passport, draining your phone battery, eating something strange thatdisagrees with you, or getting lost in a city where you know nobody. But onceyou throw Type 1 Diabetes into the mix, it adds a whole other element ofdifficulty. As readers of Alyssa's blog probably know, Type 1 is a constantbattle between high and low blood sugars, either of which can kill you or causeserious harm if left unchecked. In a single day at my Massachusetts college, myblood sugar can fluctuate between half of and two times the amount it'ssupposed to be. That's normal – it's not perfect, but it's still pretty easy tobalance with experience and routine. When you travel at a breakneck pacethrough five countries in twelve days, though, that balance is a lot harder tomaintain. Here's the deal: I love trying new foods, and I wanted to try asmany as possible during my trip: the proper English fry-up breakfast, Frenchcrepes and baguettes, Catalonian tapas and pintxos, and Haggis in Alyssa's hometurf of Scotland (which, contrary to popular American belief, is actuallypretty good). Unfortunately, if my blood sugar was high when it came time toeat, my options were pretty limited – unless, of course, I wanted to spike myblood sugar even higher than it already was, which is never a good idea.Furthermore, all of that food had carbs, and I had no idea how many. The British love theirprotein……while the French seem toprefer carbs.And if this wasn't enough mental math, there's one thing that setsEuropean cities apart from American ones, other than perhaps New York: Everythingis incredibly walkable. Walking means exercise, and for T1s like myself,exercise makes short-acting insulin more potent. If I exercise enough withenough insulin, my blood sugar goes low, and then even walking through a citycan put me at risk for a worse low or even passing out. In short, I had to givemyself enough insulin to safely eat my next exotic meal, but not so much that Iwouldn't be able to walk around. As an example, my blood sugar was going low while walking aroundOxford with my friend, who was studying abroad there. Because of that, when wegot Cream Tea in the middle of the afternoon, I deliberately gave myself asmaller-than-normal bolus for the scones and clotted cream we ate. As it turnedout, this bolus was much too small – even after another two hours of walking,my blood sugar was at 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) when it was time for us to havedinner in Lewis and Tolkien's old haunt, the Eagle and Child. I still got aCottage Pie anyway, because I needed food, but I was pretty sure this wouldspike my blood sugar even higher, so I gave a larger than normal bolus. Ofcourse, by the time my train got back into London's Marylebone Station thatevening, my blood sugar was low again, and I ended up buying a banana and acookie bar in the station before taking the Underground back to my hostel.Sadly, this sort of up-and-down game was typical throughout the whole trip.Oxford was still totallyworth it, though!Then, of course, if something went horribly wrong, getting sent tothe hospital in a foreign (to me) country could result in a bill equal to myentire travel budget. And if my bag full of insulin, pump supplies, backup pumpsupplies, strips, needles, swabs, glucagon, and glucose tablets got stolen, whoknew what could have happened. Thankfully, the worst didn't happen. But I did have multiple lowblood sugars pretty much every day, and half the time the only carbs I had to mewere powdered orange glucose tables from CVS, an American chain conveniencestore. Other times, a well-timed smoothie or sweet treat from whatever shop orrestaurant happened to be nearby me – my favorite pick-me-up was a chocolate chipbaguette in Paris. My worse low by far was on the final night, in my hotel inIceland, when I was at 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/L), my glucose tablets were runningout, and the vending machine refused to accept the final ten kroner coin Ineeded to buy Pepsi (thankfully it ended up taking my debit card, which Iprobably should have tried first in retrospect, but I wasn't exactly thinkingclearly).Don't let any of that scare you, though, at least no more than ishealthy. Going to Europe or any foreign-to-you country, even with Type 1 Diabetes,is absolutely worth it, so long as you understand the risks and have plans inplace to minimize them. The challenges of travelling with a chronic illness arevery real, but they are far outweighed by the places you see, the amazing foodsyou try, and the fascinating and diverse people you encounter. For me, thislatter category included the Pumptastic Scot herself, whom I met in King'sCross Station, right after discovering that, sadly, there is no barrier betweenplatforms 9 and 10. Pity . . .I already bought my Hufflepuff scarf.And thus my dreams werecrushed.If you, dear reader, are considering traveling abroad with T1D,especially solo, here are some friendly tips to help you on your journey.1. Always have backup. Bring twiceas many supplies as you think you'll need. 2. Carry a wallet card explainingwhat to do if you have an extreme low blood sugar and can't communicate.3. Upload a copy of your passportto the cloud, so that if it gets stolen you have access to it. This one goesfor everyone, but access to an ID could be especially important for a diabeticin distress.4. Learn how to say things such as""I have diabetes"" or ""I have low blood sugar"" in the language of the countryyou're visiting. My next country is China, so this will be fun…5. If you're staying in a hostel,inevitably you're going to be digging through your stuff in the dark whileother people are trying to sleep. As part of trying to only do this once, makesure you have a juice or soda ready to go next to your bed.6. Temp basals are your friend. Ifyou use a pump and you have a target blood sugar, try dropping cutting yourbasal entirely for half an hour or more while you're walking from place toplace.7. Troubleshoot, troubleshoot, troubleshoot. Ifyou're having consistent lows, drop your meal boluses, then drop them again thenext time around. Keep doing this until things even out. 8. Always be asking yourself,""What if I had a low right now?"" Pack lots and lots and lots of energy bars andglucose tablets, even if you think they're disgusting. As much as possible, buyup sodas, snacks, and juices, so that you'll have them on you if you do indeedhave a low blood sugar. When you budget for your trip, take this into account –I spent over $50 (over £38) on low blood sugar snacks during my trip.9. If you're on a plane, even alow-cost airline like Norwegian, EasyJet, or Ryanair that nickel-and-dimes youfor everything, and you have a low blood sugar, don't be afraid to ask for freesnacks and drinks if you have a low. This worked for me on Norwegian, when Ihad an overnight low on a transatlantic flight from Boston to London, and theflight attendant gave me free juice and cookies. 10. Speaking of flying, once you get on the plane, gather everything youneed to have on you during the flight – including glucose tablets and yourmeter – and stuff them into the seatback pocket in front of you. This way youwon't have to get up or dig around in a bag to find things should you have alow blood sugar.""The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.""– St. Augustine",https://t.co/FHvuJLNu5k,news
Woman says her son couldn't afford his insulin - now he's dead,"When Nicole Smith-Holt's 26-year-old son died, he had just moved out of his parents' home and was starting a life of his own. ""The hardest part is every time I tell the story, it's like reality slaps me in my face that my son is no longer here,"" Smith-Holt told CBS News correspondent Anna Werner. Her son, Alec, was a Type 1 diabetic – someone who needs to take insulin every day to survive. But turning 26 meant his parents' insurance would no longer cover the cost, shooting his monthly cost for insulin and supplies up to $1,300 per month, according to his mom. ""My son died because he could not afford his insulin,"" she said. What she said Alec didn't tell her was that he was struggling with that cost. He'd started trying to ration his insulin to make it last longer. It wasn't enough. He died after falling into a diabetic coma alone in his apartment.""Nobody to be there with him, to hold his hand or to call for help … and then I think about if he had never moved out, if he had lived at home, somebody would've, you know, seen the signs,"" Smith-Holt said. ""And I'll probably feel guilty every day for the rest of my life.""Even though Alec never told her he was struggling to pay for his insulin, she still feels like she should have known. She said she's dealing with that guilt by advocating for other Type 1 diabetics.""I deal with my own grief and my guilt by fighting for the lives of others,"" she said.The drug industry is starting the New Year by hiking the costs on hundreds of prescription medications despite pressure from President Trump. A group that tracks drug costs said about 60 companies increased the price on almost 300 medications. The price of insulin, a life-saving drug for diabetics, tripled between 2002 and 2013. Since 2008 three of the top makers raised the list price of insulin at least 10 times. Now, the state of Minnesota is taking action by suing three of the world's largest insulin manufacturers. Lori Swanson is Minnesota's attorney general. She's now suing the top three insulin manufacturers for what she calls ""deceptive, misleading, and misrepresentative list prices."" ""I think in America nobody should lose their life because they can't afford the cost of insulin,"" Swanson said. ""They've raised the price of insulin by being in cahoots with the pharmacy benefit managers and having a secret price for them that the public doesn't get."" Drug manufacturers typically must negotiate with pharmacy benefit managers, or ""PBMs"". Those PBMs are middlemen in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Swanson alleges to make money, manufacturers set ""phony"" list prices that are artificially high so they can offer greater rebates to PBMs and still maintain their profits.""The drug companies can make the same amount of money. But by doing that, they've created this ever-cascading cycle of higher and higher drug prices,"" Swanson said. Because many aspects of the process are secret according to the drug companies, portions of the lawsuit are redacted. ""It's incredibly frustrating and we're gonna be fighting that. Because these companies claim that certain information is trade secret. That it's confidential. And that they and only they can see it,"" Swanson said. That means they are not able to put those list prices in their lawsuit. ""Isn't that ridiculous? It's a public lawsuit filed in court, but we can't put the numbers in because they're claiming it's a trade secret and that nobody's entitled to know or see that information,"" Swanson said. CBS News reached out to the companies named in the lawsuit. Eli Lilly and Company told us the lawsuit's ""claims are without merit."" Novo Nordisk said the company is ""committed to ethics and compliance"" and Sanofi said it ""provides significant rebates"" but that ""unfortunately, it seems these savings are not consistently passed through to patients in the form of lower co-pays or coinsurance."" ""PBMs certainly play a problem here in the system. No doubt about it … but we sued the pharmaceutical companies because ultimately it's their product,"" Swanson said. So when those companies say it's not their fault, Lori Swanson doesn't buy it. Neither does Nicole Smith-Holt, who has turned her grief into action. Last August, she told her story to senators in Washington and in September protested outside Eli Lilly headquarters. ""You know, my son is not a statistic … he would be here if his life-saving medication was priced at a reasonable rate,"" Smith-Holt said.Lori Swanson leaves office on Monday, but said her successor plans to continue the state's lawsuit.FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that the FDA is going to be changing the way that they regulate insulin moving forward.",https://t.co/GUKJPujuar,news

As always, your comments and feedback are welcome.There are so many questions we get from patients in our clinics that are provocative but lack simple answers, and today we tackle one of the most common questions: ""Does sugar feed cancer?"" To condense the topic into a blog entry, we will not address specifically a ketogenic diet (low carbohydrate and protein, high fat, caloric restriction and fasting diet), but will save that for another blog, so stay tuned!Quick Answer BoxIt's complicated. But one should feel comfortable taking in sugars through fruits and vegetables due to their higher nutritional value and content that goes with the sugars. Some cancers might become more resistant to treatment with high sugar intake, but the science of predicting which cancers would benefit from a low sugar diet is too early in its infancy to make any general recommendations. Let's take a closer look at the science behind this question with the goal of determining a reasonable dietary change to impact both cancer risk and potentially cancer outcomes. One of the best principles in discerning the truth of information available on the internet is being mindful of our desire to over-simplify the complex. Answers given on the internet on this topic tend to make two erroneous assumptions 1) all cancers have the same biology and sensitivity to manipulation of sugar intake, and 2) because diet or excessive sugar consumption may increase risk of cancer, sugar cessation is an adequate treatment for cancer alone.First, the answer to the question ""does sugar feed cancer?"" is yes, but it's important to recognize that all of the cells in our bodies use glucose (blood sugar) for energy. In fact, the brain can only use glucose for energy. Even in a diet that contains absolutely no sugars or carbohydrates, our bodies have processes to convert some of the calories we consume from protein and fat into blood sugar so your brain and other tissues can function (thank goodness).However, there is scientific evidence that high sugar intake is at least indirectly responsible for increased cancer risk. For example, research has shown that diets excessive in sugary beverages increase the risk of many cancer types (www.aicr.org). These studies point to excessive caloric intake from sugar that promotes weight gain and obesity (a known risk factor for several cancers) and secondarily increases insulin and other growth hormones in the body (which as we will learn later, is one of the proposed mechanisms by which high sugar intake could worsen cancer outcomes). What we know sugar does not do is directly damage DNA or cause cancer, but the secondary effects of excessive sugar intake - obesity and increased insulin and insulin-like growth factors - might create an environment where cancer evolution is more likely to occur.Given that several cancers express the insulin growth factor family of receptors on its surface, it is biochemically plausible that reducing sugar intake and thereby reducing insulin and insulin growth factor levels could help improve cancer outcomes in cancers that gain survival/growth benefits through that signaling pathway. However, this has not been proven yet in rigorous, well-designed randomized clinical trials. The best evidence we have to support this concept comes from animal models. To highlight one study among several, mice implanted with prostate cancer cells that became palpable were randomized to high carbohydrate, high fat meals or low carbohydrate, high fat meals. The investigators found that the mice fed high carbohydrate meals had statistically significant higher insulin and IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor-1) levels and body weight as well as nearly two times greater prostate cancer cell growth (Venkateswaran V, 2007).Evidence is less strong for human studies, but in a retrospective study, investigators found that consumption of sugary beverages correlated to shorter survival with cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract (Miles FL, 2016). Also, individuals with Laron syndrome (mutations in the growth hormone receptor that lead to severe congenital IGF-1 deficiency, with decreased insulin/IGF-1 signaling) have reduced cancer risk.The next question you might be asking is, why are these studies focusing on insulin levels and IGF-1 levels and not blood glucose? First, the blood glucose of these mice would likely have been normal. Our bodies have an intricate biochemical system to make sure blood glucose levels stay within a tight range (when out of balance, diabetes ensues) and insulin is a key regulator of this. But the current paradigm of understanding the harmful effects of high glucose intake is rooted in the concept of secondary hyper-insulinemia required to cope with such a lifestyle and the effects insulin, IGF-1 can have on both cancer growth and resistance to conventional treatment such as chemotherapy or hormone therapy.For the most current understanding of how insulin, IGF1 affect cellular function, see Figure 1. Djiogue et al 2013 ""Insulin resistance and cancer: the role of insulin and IGFs"" Endocr Relat Cancer Feb 1 2013 R1-R17The main point of showing this figure is to demonstrate the futility of making general statements like ""sugar feeds cancer"", ""insulin feeds cancer"" or even ""IGF1 feeds cancer"". The figure shows that there are several receptors that can bind insulin or IGF1. How a cancer cell reacts to insulin or IGF1 depends on the context of which, if any, of those receptors lies on its surface. For example, insulin could just simply mediate sugar metabolism (through Insulin Receptor B), or it could deliver proliferation signals through an Insulin Receptor A, IGFR-1 or a hybrid of these two receptors, and speed up cancer growth or make the cancer cells more resistant to conventional cancer treatment. Lastly, if the cell does not have Insulin Receptor A or IGFR-1 on its surface, no effects might be seen. A closer look at the clinical relevance of the IGF signaling pathwaysTo avoid confusion, sugar does not specifically drive increased IGF-1 production, but the secondarily increased insulin does suppress production of insulin growth factor binding proteins, which makes IGF-1 more available to both normal and cancer cells (M, 2012). Also, drugs that have been studied in human clinical trials that target and block the IGF1R receptor have been disappointing and benefit has mainly been seen in the subset of patients who have high circulating IGF1 levels. One of the common explanations given for the disappointing results is the degree of ""cross-talk"" and ""redundancy"" between the different receptors and signaling pathways, where blocking IGF1R only inhibits one route of several by which cells are given growth stimuli. Additionally, the recent published preclinical study has demonstrated that sucrose and fructose overconsumption in mice greatly accelerates the onset and progression of breast tumors in three different mouse or human breast tumor models through modulation of inflammatory pathways, independent of weight change or blood sugar (Jiang Y, Cancer Research, 2016). So what should I do about sugars?Although not reviewed here, there are many long-term benefits of reducing sugar intake such as weight control. Several studies have shown women who gain weight after breast cancer diagnosis trend towards worse cancer specific outcomes and clear improvement in all-cause mortality (Playdon MC, 2015). The best anyone can say with the current science is that limiting sugar intake for someone dealing with cancer diagnosis will improve overall health and weight, and reduce side effects of cancer treatment (sugar intake can worsen hot flashes from anti-hormonal treatment). It might also enhance the benefits of conventional treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation) and reduce risk of future cancer diagnoses. And for a subset of the cancers diagnosed, there might be a benefit in reducing sugar intake and secondary insulin and IGF1 availability as well as reducing inflammation on actual cancer outcomes, but the data is limited to animal studies and specific cancer cell lines.So if one were inclined, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans encourage a limit of only 10 percent of calories per day from added sugars. For the average person, this means only 200 calories (50gm) from added sugars out of 2000 calories total should be consumed. This is a tough order. For example, a 12oz. can of soda or a single serving size of your favorite sweetened yogurt likely contains up to 40 gm of added sugars. One teaspoon of sugar is equal to four grams of sugar. Thus, sugary beverages which include soda, fruit juices, sports drinks, energy drinks and specialty sweetened coffees should be consumed only occasionally. Are these guidelines effective enough to harness a potential anti-cancer effect? We do not know. But, if your baseline sugar intake is greater than 50gm/day currently, chances are your overall health will eventually be compromised.But thinking further, what does this mean for brown sugar, raw sugar, honey, molasses, maple syrup and jam? Beyond sweeteners, what about foods that contain natural sugars, as in fruits and plain yogurt, as well as added sugars, which include just about everything you can think of from ketchup to bread? What about carbohydrates, like starches, fruits and milks, which are broken down into sugars? What is left to eat?Keep in mind that a plant-based diet has been found to be cancer protective. Choosing whole grains, vegetables, beans and fruits in the right portion provides important phytochemicals, antioxidants, electrolytes and fiber in addition to the carbohydrates. One key to success is to avoid ""empty calories"" such as soda, refined grains and highly processed foods, where very little nutritional value is being provided outside of the calories. And take the time to read the sugar content on the food labels. Find the cereals and yogurts with the least sugar possible. Eat your fruit to get more fiber/pulp in lieu of juices. And be aware that too much portions of a healthy food can still make it unhealthy from a caloric standpoint.Finally, malnutrition and severe weight loss, especially muscle weight, is very common during cancer treatment. Adequate nutrition is critical. It has been shown that weight loss and malnutrition during cancer treatment decreases tolerability of cancer therapy and is associated with worse outcomes (Barret M, 2011). Any dietary change that results in a lower caloric intake should be reviewed by your health care provider, and other foods might be required to meet nutritional needs. Making weight loss the only end point for your dietary and lifestyle choices could lead to harmful outcomes, so please seek guidance from an available dietitian.",https://t.co/I4n6GKDEKZ,news
Acute Effects of,"It is well known that a single-exercise session and exercise training can improve insulin sensitivity (1,2). However, the duration in which exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity persists varies significantly among studies, ranging from 0 to 72 h after the last bout of exercise (2–6). One factor that may explain the variability in the duration of improved insulin sensitivity among studies is the magnitude of energy deficit after exercise. Although it is often assumed that chronic skeletal muscle adaptations after exercise are primarily responsible for the improvements in insulin sensitivity (7), data from caloric restriction studies demonstrate that acute changes in energy balance with no changes in body composition can lead to acute improvements in insulin sensitivity during negative energy balance and acute reductions in insulin sensitivity during positive energy balance (8,9). Further evidence was demonstrated by Toledo et al. (3) in which the amount of energy expended during exercise was the strongest predictor of improvements in insulin sensitivity, and the mean daily energy expenditure accounted for 75% of the variance in improved insulin sensitivity. Additionally, Black et al. (10) found that 6 d of exercise training without energy replacement led to significant improvements in insulin action, whereas there were no changes when participants were refed the energy expended from exercise. Lastly, Segal et al. (11) demonstrated that refeeding the amount of energy expended during 12 wk of training led to no improvement in insulin action or insulin resistance in obese and diabetic men. Therefore, it is important to control for energy balance when trying to compare the acute versus chronic effects of exercise on insulin sensitivity. It has also become increasingly clear that exercise intensity can influence improvements in insulin sensitivity (6,12,13). A recent meta-analysis comparing high-intensity interval (HII) training to moderate-intensity continuous (MIC) exercise training demonstrated greater improvements in insulin resistance in HII training as compared with MIC training (14,15). However, although there is convincing evidence that HII exercise may provide greater improvements for insulin sensitivity there have been several studies that have shown no differences on insulin sensitivity between low intensity and high-intensity exercise protocols (16,17). One of the challenges when trying to elucidate the mechanisms through which higher-intensity exercise influences insulin sensitivity is controlling for greater amounts of energy expended per unit time as compared with lower-intensity exercise. Ross et al. (13) attempted to address this by comparing the effects of habitual exercise training of differing intensities on glucose tolerance while controlling for energy balance using dietary recalls (13). The primary finding from this study was higher-intensity exercise was required to improve 2-h glucose levels. Although this study did attempt to control for energy balance using a dietary recall approach, it is well known that these approaches are limited and are highly variable in regards to accuracy (18,19). Thus, it is critical to conduct well-controlled studies that utilize state of the art equipment to control for energy balance when assessing the independent effects of exercise intensity on changes in insulin sensitivity. Although the benefits of exercise training per se for improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity has been widely reported, there is also convincing evidence that a single-exercise session performed at high or moderate exercise intensities can improve insulin sensitivity for up to 24 to 48 h (20–22). Additionally, Nelson et al. (2014) found that a single session of exercise in sedentary overweight adults could improve insulin sensitivity to similar levels of individuals that were physically active (23). Thus, although routine exercise training is associated with long-term health benefits and reduces risk for onset of chronic diseases it remains unclear if these benefits are due to the most recent exercise session or if they are a result of long-term physiological adaptations that occur as a result of routine exercise training. Furthermore, given recent evidence that exercise intensity may impact the magnitude of exercise induced improvements in insulin sensitivity studies are needed to compare the acute effects of exercise intensity for improving insulin sensitivity. We are aware of no studies that have assessed the effects of an acute bout of HII exercise versus moderate-intensity continuous exercise for improving insulin sensitivity when controlling for energy balance. Thus, the overall purpose of this study was to compare the chronic effects of 8 to 16 wk of aerobic exercise training and the acute effects of a single bout of MIC aerobic exercise or HII exercise for improving insulin sensitivity under rigorously controlled energy-balanced conditions using whole room indirect calorimetry. METHODS Study participants Twenty-eight women between 20 and 40 yr of age participated in this study. Participants reported normal menstrual cycles and were not taking oral contraceptives or any medications known to influence glucose and/or lipid metabolism. Additional inclusion criteria were: (i) normotensive; (ii) nonsmoker; (iii) sedentary as defined by participating in any exercise-related activities &lt;1× per week; and (iv) normoglycemic as evaluated by postprandial glucose response to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. All participants provided written informed consent. Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and conformed to the guidelines set forth by the Declaration of Helsinki. Procedures After initial screening and fitness assessments, all participants were evaluated four times during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Participants stayed in a room calorimeter for the 23 h before testing. Food was provided for 2 d prior room calorimeter visits, and food intake was adjusted during the stay in the room calorimeter to maintain energy balance. The first evaluation was considered baseline. Posttraining evaluations took place after 8, 12, and 16 wk of exercise training (Fig. 1). The three posttraining evaluations were performed in a randomized order and consisted of the following: 1) after 60 h of no exercise (NE), designed to evaluate the effects of chronic exercise training); 2) ≈22 h after 1 h of continuous stationary cycle ergometry at 50% peak V˙O2 (MIC); and 3) ≈22 h after 1 h of interval stationary cycle ergometry at 84% peak V˙O2 (HII). Details regarding exercise sessions in the room calorimeter are outlined in the room calorimeter exercise methods section below. Posttraining assessments (NE, MIC, and HII exercise) were randomized to reduce the risk of bias by ordered effects and were 1 month apart to permit testing during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Forty-eight hours before testing, participants were required to abstain from any exercise or vigorous physical activity. Food was provided to participants during the 2 d preceding testing. Caloric intake during these 2 d was estimated from doubly labeled water estimates of free-living energy expenditure of 330 sedentary premenopausal women collected from our laboratory. The following equation was used: equation 1 = 750 kcal + [(31.47 FFM) − (0.31 FM) − (155 × race); race coded 1 for African American and 2 for European American] (24). Diets were prepared by the Clinical Research Unit and consisted of ≈60% energy as carbohydrates, ≈25% energy as fat, and ≈15% energy as protein. Dietary sodium and the ratio between polyunsaturated: saturated fats were held constant to reduce the potential confounding effects of thermic processes. Energy balance Our goal for providing food was to achieve energy balance (energy intake to match energy expenditure) especially during the room calorimeter visit. Breakfast was at 9:30 AM (35% of planned energy intake), lunch was at 1:00 PM (25% of planned energy intake), and supper was at 6:00 PM (40% of planned energy intake). We used multiple regression to develop three equations (equations 2–3) to estimate energy expenditure while the subjects were in the room calorimeter as follows. An equation for estimating the room calorimeter energy intake was developed from room calorimeter visits of &gt;200 premenopausal women: equation 2 = 465 kcal + [(27.8 FFM) − (2.4 FM) − (188 × race); race coded 1 for African American and 2 for European American]. The estimated energy cost of the exercise (based on American College of Sports Medicine metabolic equations) during the MIC and HII visits were added to the equation 2 result: equation 3 = (equation 2 estimated energy expenditure + energy cost of MIC or HII exercise). We recognized that the estimates may result in overfeeding or underfeeding individual subjects. Thus, we developed a correction equations for the room calorimeter visit that was based on energy expenditure during the room calorimeter stay up to 5:30 PM. This equation was as follows: equation 4 = 9(390 kcal + average energy expenditure in kcal·min−1 between 8:00 AM and 5:30 PM) × 925 kcal) − equation 3 estimated of energy expenditure). Food intake was adjusted during the evening meal to match the results of equation 4. Exercise training After the baseline assessment, all participants trained three times per week on a bicycle ergometer for the duration of the study. Participants trained initially for 20 min at 65% of maximum heart rate and progressively increased their training until they were training continuously for 40 min at 80% of maximum heart rate by week 4. Heart rate was monitored throughout each session by a Polar Vantage XL heart rate monitor. All sessions were under the supervision of an exercise physiologist in a training facility dedicated to research. Participants were instructed to refrain from all other exercise training for the duration of the study. Peak aerobic capacity A peak aerobic capacity test was conducted 2 to 4 d before each room calorimeter visit. After an initial warm-up, participants completed a cycle ergometer graded exercise test to measure peak oxygen uptake (V˙O2peak) as determined by the highest level reached in the final stage of exercise. Power output began at 25 W and increased by 25 W every 2 min until participants reached volitional exhaustion. Oxygen uptake, ventilation, and respiratory exchange ratio were determined by indirect calorimetry using a MAX-II metabolic cart (Physio-Dyne Instrument Company, Quogue, NY). Heart rate was continuously monitored by Polar® Vantage XL heart rate monitors (Polar Beat, Port Washington, NY). Criteria for achieving V˙O2peak were heart rate within 10 bpm of estimated maximum, RER of at least 1.10, and plateauing of V˙O2. All subjects achieved at least one criteria and all but three subjects achieved at least two criteria during each of the four tests. Room calorimeter Participants spent 23 h in a whole-room respiration chamber (3.38-m long, 2.11-m wide, and 2.58-m high) for measurement of total energy expenditure (TEE) and resting energy expenditure (REE). The design characteristics and calibration of the calorimeter were described previously (14). Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were continuously measured with the use of a magnetopneumatic differential oxygen analyzer (Magnos206; ABB, Frankfurt, Germany) and a nondispersive infrared industrial photometer differential carbon dioxide analyzer (Uras26; ABB). The calorimeter was calibrated before each participant entered the chamber. Zero calibration was carried out simultaneously for both analyzers. The full scale was set for 0% to 1% for the carbon dioxide analyzer and 0% to 2% for the oxygen analyzer. Each participant entered the calorimeter at 8:00 AM. Metabolic data were collected throughout the 23-h stay. Each participant was awakened at 0630 the next morning. REE was then measured for 30 min before the subject left the calorimeter at 7:00 AM. Hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp measures were conducted immediately after participants exited the room calorimeter. Exercise sessions in room calorimeter Workload for the MIC exercise was calculated from the VO2peak that corresponded to each follow-up assessment using the appropriate metabolic equation for cycle ergometry [V˙O2 (mL·kg−1·min−1)) + 2 × (mass (kg) × length (m))/(time (min)) + (3.5 × body mass)] in accordance with the American College of Sports Medicine. During the MIC exercise, participants cycled continuously for 60 min at an intensity of 50% V˙O2peak. Fifteen work intervals were performed for 2 min 24 s with rest intervals of 1 min 43 s for the HII exercise. Work was calculated by multiplying 1.66 to the MIC exercise workload, which equated to 84% V˙O2peak. Total work was identical among the two exercise bouts. Work load was controlled outside the room calorimeter using a Collins electronically braked cycle ergometer (Warren E. Collins, Braintree, MA). Body composition Total and regional body composition (i.e., percent fat, fat mass and lean mass) were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA; GE-Lunar, Madison, WI). Participants wore light clothing and remained supine in compliance with normal testing procedures. Scans were analyzed with enCORE 2011 software (GE Healthcare Lunar, Madison, WI). Hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp A hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp was administered providing a continuous infusion of regular insulin (Humulin; Eli Likely &amp; Co., Indianapolis, IN) at 40 mU·m−2 body surface area per minute through the brachial vein. Body surface area was calculated using the method of Du Bois (25). Blood glucose was monitored at bedside at 5-min intervals using a YSI 2300 STAT Plus (YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, OH) and a 20% dextrose solution was infused at a variable rate to maintain euglycemia (targeting 90 mg·dL−1). Serum samples were collected from the antecubital vein every 10 min for laboratory analysis of insulin and glucose. The procedure lasted approximately 2 h. The protocol for the steady state period was a period of 30 min or longer (at least 1 h after beginning the insulin infusion) during which the coefficients of variation for serum glucose, and the recorded dextrose infusion rate were less than 5%. Mean parameter values during the steady state period for each individual clamp were used to calculate the SIClamp [defined as M/(ssG × △I), where M is the steady state glucose infusion rate (mg·kg−1·min−1), ssG is the steady-state blood glucose concentrations (mg·dL−1), and △I is the difference between basal and steady state serum insulin concentrations (μU·mL−1)] (26). Statistics All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics for Macintosh Version 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics and primary outcome variables (SIclamp) are reported as mean ± standard deviation. A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare differences across conditions (baseline, NE, MIC, and HII) for each dependent variable. Condition sequence was assessed as a covariate to determine if there was an order effect. When significance was observed, Bonferroni pairwise comparisons were used to compare differences between each condition. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS Descriptive statistics at baseline and the effects of each condition are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences between conditions for exercise adherence (NE = 84%, MIC = 89%, and HII = 81%). Additionally, there was no significant effect of condition sequence. A significant time effect was observed for V˙O2 peak, such that a 6.5% improvement was observed for V˙O2 peak after 8 to 16 wk of exercise training (P &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were observed for percent fat, fasting glucose, or fasting insulin. There were no significant differences in energy balance (Kcals consumed − Kcals expended) measured in the room calorimeter between each condition (Fig. 2), demonstrating effective control of energy balance among all four conditions. A significant time effect was observed for 24-h respiratory exchange ratio after the initial 12 wk of exercise training (P &lt; 0.05), (Fig. 3). A significant main effect of time was observed for SIclamp (P &lt; 0.05). Bonferroni pairwise comparisons between time points showed a significant improvement in SIclamp after HII compared with baseline and NE (P &lt; 0.05). No significant improvements in SIclamp were observed between baseline, NE, or MIC time points (Fig. 4). DISCUSSION The purpose of this study in healthy premenopausal women was to determine the effects of aerobic exercise training and the acute effects of a moderate- or high-intensity exercise bout for improving whole body insulin sensitivity when rigorously controlling energy balance using a room calorimeter. The primary finding was that HII exercise significantly improved SI 22 h after exercise when we controlled energy balance. We did not see any significant improvements after 8 to 12 wk of aerobic exercise training (NE) or after an acute bout of moderate-intensity continuous (MIC) exercise. These observations are in agreement with Ross et al. (13), who found that 2-h glucose tolerance only improved in individuals performing high-intensity exercise. However, given the fact that we controlled for energy balance our findings suggest that the benefits of performing higher-intensity exercise for improving insulin sensitivity may be due some other factor other than energy deficit after the higher-intensity exercise. Our study was unique in that we utilized a longer term training period, 8 to 16 wk of training, to assess the chronic effects of exercise training. We did not see any significant improvements in SI after chronic exercise training. Importantly, energy balance was tightly controlled during the ensuing 22 h before the hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp assessment, and there was no significant weight loss or change in body composition throughout the study. The lack of a training induced significant increase in SI in the NE group is in agreement with several previous studies that suggest that energy deficit during chronic exercise training is the primary factor responsible for improving SI. Indeed, we (27) and others (28,29) have shown that energy deficit using caloric restriction alone, exercise alone, or combined led to similar improvements in SI. Furthermore, previous investigations in both men (30) and women (31) that adjusted dietary intake to account for increased energy expenditure during exercise training found no significant improvements in SI after 12 and 14 wk of training, which suggests that training adaptations are driven at least in part by negative energy balance elicited during exercise training. In addition to chronic exercise training it is also well known that an acute bout of exercise (1,2,32) and short term exercise training (2,33) can improve SI. However, an important potential confounder in the majority of these studies is the likelihood that subjects remained in energy deficit before assessment of SI. We attempted to control energy balance while assessing the impact of two different exercise intensities on SI. Several (6,12–14) but not all (34,35) previous studies have demonstrated greater improvements in SI after high-intensity exercise training; however, these studies were unable to determine if improvements were due to exercise mediated effects or an energy surplus or deficit. When accounting for energy balance, we found a significant improvement in SI after the HII condition but not the MIC condition. These data support the notion that an acute bout of high-intensity exercise may provide superior benefits for improving SI compared to lower-intensity exercise. Furthermore, these data also suggest that improvements after HII are at least in part independent of energy balance. Although we attempted to control energy balance before assessment of SI, we could not control for carbohydrate balance. Carbohydrate deficit rather than energy deficit is thought to be the primary driver of exercise-induced improvements in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Indeed, a number of previous investigations have shown that improvements in SI with exercise are associated with reductions in muscle glycogen (36,37). Additionally, work from Fox et al. (38) has found that sustaining a carbohydrate deficit rather than an energy deficit is the key contributor for improving SI. Furthermore, when CHO intake after exercise was controlled and excess lipid was infused to create an 1100 kcal surplus there was no difference in SI (39). Because exercise at higher intensities selectively depletes glycogen (40), it is possible that glycogen deficit explained the increase in SI after high-intensity exercise in this study. Although these data suggest that carbohydrate balance may be critical in determining the effects of exercise induced SI, there is evidence from a one-legged cycling study that this may not be the case. Stephens et al. (41) conducted a study in humans in which they performed 90 min of a one-legged cycling exercise protocol at 60% V˙O2max followed by a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp 22 h postexercise. Skeletal muscle glycogen content measured before the clamp was similar between the exercise and nonexercise leg, however there was 17% greater glycogen stored in the exercise versus nonexercise leg after the clamp, demonstrating an improvement in insulin action in the exercise leg independent of glycogen content (41). It is possible that the high-intensity exercise served to increase glycogen storage in the exercised leg, thus increasing glucose removal. In our study urine nitrogen was collected on a subset of participants (n = 13), in our exploratory analyses we found that carbohydrate balance was not associated with insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it remains to be determined if muscle glycogen content is critical for exercise-induced improvement in SI. There is compelling evidence that sustaining a glycogen or carbohydrate deficit during the postexercise period may lead to greater- or prolonged- improvements in SI after exercise. Further work is needed to better understand the interactions between exercise volume, intensity, and postexercise macronutrient intake for improving SI. Strengths of our study included use of the whole room indirect calorimeter to control for energy balance before assessment of SI and use of the hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp for assessment of SI. All assessments were conducted during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, enabling tight control of the hormonal effects on metabolism. Additionally, exercise training was performed under supervision by trained exercise physiologists throughout the study and acute sessions were rigorously monitored while participants were within the room calorimeter. A limitation in this study was the absence of an energy deficit group that did not perform exercise. Additionally, the conclusions from this study are limited to healthy premenopausal women. Furthermore, without direct measures of muscle glycogen and only collecting urine nitrogen on half of the cohort we are only able to speculate as to the potential contributions of energy balance versus carbohydrate balance per se. Finally, although the changes in Si were relatively small and not significant between the NE and baseline as well as the NE and MIC the power was relatively low (below 0.75 for both contrasts) so it is impossible to determine whether chronic exercise training and an acute bout of exercise influenced insulin sensitivity. However, these results are consistent with the concept that a bout of high-intensity exercise induces a larger increase in insulin sensitivity for at least 24 h compared with either chronic exercise training or an acute bout of moderate-intensity exercise. In conclusion, the overall implication from the present study was that 12 wk of aerobic exercise training did not improve SI in a cohort of premenopausal women when energy balance was controlled; thus, widely reported improvements in SI in response to chronic exercise training may be at least partly mediated by shifts in energy balance. However, an acute bout of HII exercise may increase SI even in the context of energy balance. Thus, high-intensity exercise may be more effective for treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases related to insulin resistance. The results of this study are presented clearly, honestly, and without fabrication, falsification, or inappropriate data manipulation.

Surprising Foods That Help Lower Blood Sugar If You Have Diabetes,"For the 26 million people in the U.S. with diabetes and the estimated 79 million American adults with pre-diabetes, there has never been a better time to start managing and improving your diabetes. Researchers know more today than they did just five years ago about diet, insulin, medications and complications.Each person with type 2 diabetes needs to work out his/her particular eating, exercise or medical plan so it translates into normal blood sugars in his/her particular body. In general food and meal choices that work best for these people are lower sugar, lower sodium, higher fiber, lean meats and plant protein, fruits and vegetables and sources of monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids. Beyond that there are some specific and even surprising foods that may help lower blood sugars in people with diabetes. Information and recipes for the following can be found in the new edition of my best-selling book, Tell Me What to Eat If I Have Diabetes..Foods with little to no carbohydrateThe following foods, when eaten alone, even in large amounts, are not likely to cause a significant rise in blood sugar because they contain few carbohydrates:MeatPoultryFishAvocadosDark green veggies and salad vegetablesEggsCheeseMushroomsSome Nuts (a 2-ounce serving of these nuts contain 5 grams or less net carbs: almonds, brazil nuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, pecans, walnuts).Foods with synergyIn my book, FOOD SYNERGY, I looked at research that suggested synergy within and between certain foods or food components—where components seemed to work together for maximum health benefit. Foods with synergy that seemed to keep insulin levels steady include:Whole grainsSoluble fiber in oatsSoy proteinGround flaxseedFoods and food partnerships with synergy that might improve blood sugar control include:FiberWhole grainsSoluble fiber in oatsBeansGround flaxseedGreen TeaI'm a big green/white tea advocate because of all the antioxidant plant compounds (polyphenols) it provides, but there are possibly bigger benefits for people with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. More investigation needs to be done, but a review of 17 randomized clinical trials suggests green tea consumption was associated with lower fasting blood sugar levels and lower fasting insulin levels.BeansThere's a lot more to beans than helping fill burritos! It's the whole nutritional package (both types of fiber, carbs, protein, vitamins, minerals and assorted plant compounds) that may help improve blood sugars in people with type 2 diabetes. The plant protein and fiber in beans slow digestion (releasing carbs into the bloodstream slowly), which can help lessen the rise in blood sugar. The protein may help stimulate the release of insulin after the meal, while the protein and fiber also enhance the feeling of fullness.BuckwheatBuckwheat does appear to be a potentially ""magical"" intact whole grain for people with diabetes; new research suggests buckwheat extract lowered meal-related blood sugar levels by 12-19 percent when given to rats. Look for buckwheat soba noodles and start experimenting with buckwheat groats.Whey proteinWhey protein hydrolysates may prove to be helpful anti-diabetic agents, according to new research with obese diabetic mice. The whey protein improved blood glucose clearance, reduced elevated insulin levels, and remarkably restored the ability of pancreas cells to release insulin in response to glucose. These amazing potential benefits aren't totally out of the blue, past research has linked lowfat dairy with a reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes and specific amino acids in milk have been reported to stimulate insulin secretion.CinnamonSeveral studies suggest cinnamon has a possible blood sugar lowering effect. For example, one study suggested less than a half-teaspoon of cinnamon a day might reduce blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. Another study found 2 teaspoons helped lower blood sugar levels after meals. More research needs to be done but in the meantime, sprinkle some cinnamon in your morning cereal, yogurt, smoothies, or coffee/lattes.MushroomsStay tuned as more research trial results become available, but put mushrooms on our list of potential foods with anti-diabetic properties. So far, preliminary data from human trials appear to mirror the encouraging results in diabetic animal research, which includes potential in helping to lower plasma glucose, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and serum triglycerides. Polysaccharides (possibly both alpha- and beta- glucans) are the plant compounds in mushrooms that are thought to be responsible for these desirable effects. The mechanism needs to be confirmed, but some researchers suspect they work directly with insulin receptors on target tissues.Diet SodaDiet soda can be a great alternative for soda lovers because they don't contribute carbohydrates or calories. Recent intervention studies point toward a beneficial effect of low or no calorie sweeteners on fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels as well as insulin levels, energy or calorie intake and body weight—all things that people with diabetes care about. Certainly it is important to drink water most of the time, but there is definitely room within a healthy diabetic lifestyle to enjoy a diet soda when a flavored beverage is preferred.

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/p5NRGtXMf1,news
The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/a6skgAR8TT,news
Diabetics struggle as drug prices soar,"Struggling to stay alive: Rising insulin prices cause diabetics to go to extremes The escalating cost of insulin has desperate diabetics rationing medication, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from Canada or Mexico. Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY Corrections &amp; Clarifications: This story has been updated to reflect royalty payments for a 1923 patent.Meaghan Carter died alone on the sofa of her suburban Dayton, Ohio, apartment last Christmas.Like most people with Type 1 diabetes, the 47-year-old nurse had a kit of essential supplies within reach. It contained two empty vials of her preferred insulin, a partial vial of inexpensive Walmart insulin and a half-filled container of testing strips to measure blood glucose levels.Uninsured, between jobs and with $50 in a bank account, Carter probably had attempted to stretch a limited supply of insulin until she got a final paycheck from her last job, family members say. She was scheduled to begin a new nursing job the following week that offered health insurance.""There was no insulin at all in the refrigerator,"" says Mindi Patterson, Carter's sister-in-law. ""She had gauze, bandages and all her nursing supplies. She had plenty to take care of others but not enough to take care of herself."" She buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive in the US Deidre Waxman buys her insulin in Canada because it's too expensive for her on MedicareErin Clark and Jasper Colt, USA TODAYThe cost of insulin for diabetics such as Carter has drawn national scrutiny as Congress examines factors contributing to the nation's escalating prescription drug prices. All people with Type 1 and some with Type 2 diabetes need the drug, but regular price hikes make insulin difficult to afford for the uninsured and those whose coverage requires significant cost sharing.Patient advocates are becoming increasingly vocal about the affordability of a drug invented nearly a century ago by scientists who took steps to make the medicine inexpensive. One group staged protests outside the offices of the nation's three dominant insulin makers.Canadian scientists discovered insulin in 1921, treated the first diabetic patient in 1922 and sold the patent to the University of Toronto for 3 Canadian dollars. The university administered the patent and received royalty payments from drug companies that sold human insulin.The price of modern versions of a drug that more than 7 million Americans need to live nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013, according to one study. Type 1 diabetics paid an average of $5,705 for insulin in 2016 – nearly double what they paid in 2012, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.Diedre Waxman lives in Newton, Mass., and has Type 1 diabetes. Diagnosed six years ago, Waxman has adopted a strict diet, so she doesn't need as much insulin, which she purchases from Canada.Erin Clark for USA TODAYPatient advocates say people have resorted to extreme measures such as taking less than the doctor prescribed to make it last longer, acquiring the drug from friends or getting it from less expensive pharmacies in Canada or Mexico.More: Lack of insulin could affect 40 million people with diabetes by 2030, study findsLast month, the powerful Senate Finance Committee asked the three dominant insulin makers detailed questions about the drugs' price increases. The price for one vial of Eli Lilly's Humalog surged from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015. From 2013 to this year, Novo Nordisk's Novolog jumped from $289 to $540 and Sanofi's Lantus from $244 to $431, according to a committee letter.A vial of insulin loses potency after being opened for 28 days. The amount of insulin a patient needs varies depending on such factors as age, weight, diet and overall health.Among things senators want to know: How do drugmakers set insulin prices, and what's the role of rebates and discounts to middlemen pharmacy benefit managers?Senators are not limiting questions to Big Pharma. The nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, who drew scrutiny for their increasingly powerful role as middlemen in the drug supply chain, will appear before the committee April 3.Drugmakers say they've taken steps to address prices, offered co-pay cards to limit out-of-pocket expenses and funded patient-assistance programs that provide free medication to thousands of vulnerable Americans.Sanofi pledged to limit annual price increases to less than the average health spending rate.This month, Eli Lilly unveiled a half-price version of Humalog called insulin lispro for $137.50 for a single vial. It's the same drug as Humalog, only with a different label.In a statement, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the lower-cost insulin is a ""bridge that addresses gaps in the system until a more sustainable model is achieved.""Simeon Taylor, a University of Maryland School of Medicine diabetes researcher, says Type 1 diabetics without adequate insurance coverage are vulnerable to price increases because they can't live without the drug.""Insulin is not an optional medication,"" says Taylor, who formerly worked for Eli Lilly and the National Institutes of Health. ""People have to buy insulin no matter what the cost is. That gives a lot of strength to the people selling insulin.""'Whole system needs to be evaluated'Some suggest that a simple across-the-board price cut might not work for all patients under the system.The American Diabetes Association convened an Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group to study rising insulin prices and affordability of the life-sustaining medicine. The group's study concluded that a complex supply chain from the drug factory to the pharmacy might promote higher prices.Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers, demand rebates from drug manufacturers. Their leverage: placing the drug on an insurer's formulary – the list of drugs that the insurance company will cover for insured consumers.A drugmaker that offers a lower rebate might be excluded from a prescription drug plan or be placed on a less favorable tier that requires consumers to pay a larger portion on the tab.More: Insulin costs nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, report saysThe ADA's working group's report found that even though drugmakers' ""list prices"" for insulin have surged, their ""net prices"" have grown at a more modest rate. The list price is how much the drugmaker charges. The net price is money the drugmaker gets after fees, discounts and rebates to wholesalers or pharmacy benefit managers.Consumers are not privy to these behind-the-scenes negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers and drug manufacturers. All of this is done outside the public's view.""A lot of attention has focused on the manufacturers and less on the other players in the supply chain,"" says Karen Van Nuys, a research professor at USC's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and member of the ADA's working group. ""We think those players also share responsibility for what happens to prices and access.""Van Nuys says that if one drugmaker lowers insulin prices, that could put it at a competitive disadvantage compared with peers. That is because pharmacy benefit managers might still require a significant rebate.Novo Nordisk says its insulin net prices declined at double-digit rates in 2017 and 2018 because of rebate demands.""The whole system needs to be evaluated,"" Van Nuys says.Study: Cost affects insulin useNewton, Massachusetts, resident Deidre Waxman has good prescription-drug coverage through Medicare.But she worries that the $1,300 to $1,500 monthly retail cost of her insulin will be unaffordable if she reaches the doughnut hole, Medicare's deductible that kicks in once drug spending exceeds $3,820.She does not fill insulin prescriptions at her neighborhood pharmacy; she gets her medicine from Canada. Her husband buys insulin during his frequent work trips there, and she will take a six-hour car trip to Canada once a year to get insulin. A third source is Mark's Marine, a Vancouver, British Columbia, pharmacy that ships to U.S. patients.Waxman does not need much insulin because she is on a low-carbohydrate diet. If she has excess insulin, she packs it in styrofoam containers cooled with ice packs and sends it to fellow diabetes patients who can't afford the drug.""I send it to friends who are in dire need,"" Waxman says. ""These are people who would die without insulin.""Diedre Waxman's diabetes bag includes the pen she loads with cartridges to administer her insulin.Erin Clark for USA TODAYFor those without robust insurance coverage, there are signs they are having difficulty affording insulin.Kasia Lipska is an endocrinologist at Yale School of Medicine. Lipska noticed that more Yale Diabetes Center patients seemed to struggle to pay for insulin, so doctors surveyed patients about whether cost influenced their insulin use.One in four patients responded that cost prompted them to use less insulin than prescribed, take smaller doses, stretch out supplies, not fill a prescription or not start the drug. It was a small study at one center in Connecticut, and researchers can't be certain whether insulin affordability is better or worse in other states.People who struggle to pay are ""more in the middle,"" Lipska says. They don't qualify for Medicaid, the state insurance plan for low-income residents, and some earn too much to qualify for patient-assistance programs.A person with Type 1 diabetes who discontinues the drug might get sick, hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis or die, she says.More: Eli Lilly to introduce generic version of insulin drug Humalog that cuts price in halfThe health problems of diabetics who take less than they need might take longer to detect but can be just as serious.Taking less insulin than prescribed can lead to serious health harms, Lipska says. Those could include a diabetic ulcer, a foot infection that leads to amputation or kidney damage.""We know it's a problem,"" Lipska says. ""The problem leads to, in very severe cases, patients dying, people having complications, people being admitted to the hospital.""'You realize you don't have any left'Blind in one eye and her vision rapidly deteriorating in the other, Sarah Theubet could not afford the medicine her body needed to slow the harmful effects of diabetes.Insulin was too expensive. The uninsured Redding, California, resident could not afford the cost of a drug that had more than tripled since the early 2000s.""It was terrifying,"" Theubet says. ""You are looking at the vial, and you realize you don't have any left.""Theubet turned to friends she met through social media in 2016 and 2017 to solicit insulin donations while she drastically changed her diet so she would not need as much medicine.She ate one low-carbohydrate meal each day that rarely varied: sliced lunch meat and cheese, no bread.She barely had enough energy to make it through classes at Shasta Community College. Vision in her right eye, stabilized this decade from an operation, began to worsen because she could not afford to take insulin as prescribed. She is blind in her left eye.""With the rationing, that was the first year my ophthalmologist noticed a (vision) decline because I was all over the place,"" Theubet says of her insulin use.More: Soaring insulin prices prompt insurance shiftSarah Theubet, 38, has Type 1 diabetes that robbed her of her vision in one eye and will eventually render her blind.Michael Chapman, Redding Record Searchlight via USA TODAY NETWORKBecause she is legally blind, she qualified for Social Security disability in 2017, which includes health insurance through Medicare.

As these middlemen gained more clout, they began to demand higher rebates. Drug companies raised prices by amounts that are slightly less than what pharmacy benefit managers demanded.""This is a symptom of a dysfunctional health care system in the United States,"" Taylor says. ""I don't want to put all the blame on the companies. From my point of view, the responsibility is in how our health care system is designed.""More: Big Pharma CEOs tell senators they won't reduce drug costs without other changesCarter, the Dayton-area resident, was hospitalized twice for complications this decade and struggled to afford insulin months before she died, Patterson says.She spent $25 to buy Novolin NPH insulin from Walmart on Dec. 20, according to a receipt the family retrieved from her apartment after her death. Novolin is an older version of human insulin that must be adjusted based on regular blood and glucose testing.""I told her it was pretty unpredictable,"" Patterson says of Novolin. ""You only use it if you have no other option.""Carter was struggling on Christmas Day, feeling nauseous and slurring her words, a roommate told Huber Heights police.The roommate told police she thought Carter's blood-sugar levels were off and urged her to call a doctor or a paramedic.Carter refused, and the roommate left for work. When the roommate returned from work that night, she noticed Carter appeared to be sleeping on the sofa. The following morning, the roommate checked on Carter and realized she had died. The Montgomery County Coroner determined Carter died on Christmas night, but the agency did not consider the death suspicious and did not perform an autopsy. Carter often did not take her insulin as directed, the roommate told police. A family doctor signed her death certificate, listing the cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest.Patterson, whose husband and two sons have Type 1 diabetes, is convinced her sister-in-law experienced a type of complication called diabetic ketoacidosis before she died.She says she desperately wants to see a reformed system so patients can afford the medication they need to live.""The system is broken,"" Patterson says.

60 Seconds to Better Golf and Health,"According to studies, if you move your large muscles in your legs for 60 seconds, for example lunges to the Cardiogolf Slope, your energy level could improve by 90%. Canadian researches have found that even shorts busts of motion-as long as you are moving some large muscles in your body, like thigh muscles-switches on the gene that heighten insulin sensitivity, helping your muscle and brain cells soak up 23% more energizing glucose.In my opinion, daily practice is the key to success towards any goal. Making 10 practice swings a day or exercising for 5 minutes everyday will get you playing better and in better shape than exercising or practicing for two or three hours at a time, once a week or month. First of all, it is always hard to find big chunks of time to do massive workouts or beat balls on the driving range for hours. Secondly, the long workouts and practice sessions usually lead to fatigued swings, injuries and ingrained bad habits.There is something to be said about the momentum of taking small daily steps towards a goal that is cumulatively better than taking big steps with less frequency.Practice something about your game everyday. #CardioGolfChallengeForward Lunge on SlopeStand to the side of the Slope.Lunge forward placing your foot securely on the Slope.Push off your foot and return to the start position.Repeat on opposite leg.Par Level: Do interval exercise for 20:40.Birdie Level: Do interval exercise for 30:30.Eagle Level: Do interval exercise for 40:20.In Cardiogolf, we do a variety of lunges in different planes of motion.

Tip: A Quick Guide to Hardcore Sleeping,"6 Hours of Sleep SucksMost people are sleeping less: one to two hours less than 60 years ago. Several studies show that over 30% of us are sleeping less than 6 hours a night. In our brave new world, sleep has unfortunately become a luxury and trying to prioritize it is often looked at as lazy or weak. That's ironic, because people who don't sleep are actually getting fatter and weaker. Even if we looked past the compromised immunity and increased risk of degenerative disease and early death afforded by poor sleep, inadequate sleep negatively affects our ability to build strength and muscle.Sleep releases growth hormone, and inadequate sleep is associated with higher levels of stress and lower levels of testosterone. Simply missing one hour of sleep per night (than what's optimal for you) prompts your brain to secrete cortisol and shift your body away from muscle building and toward fat storage.Even in healthy young men, a poor night's sleep results in temporary glucose intolerance (insulin resistance) and an increase in food intake. In fact, consistent sleep deprivation results in an 18-20% decrease in leptin (which affects the feeling of being full) and a 24-28% increase in ghrelin (which affects hunger), both of which can lead to fat gain.This may not sound like a big deal to disciplined lifters because they're convinced cutting calories is all they need to succeed, and ""sticking to their macros"" can solve all the world's problems. Too bad they don't know that inadequate sleep alters the composition of weight loss.In a study from the Annals of Internal Medicine, participants were put on the same restricted diet but split into separate sleep groups. Both groups lost the same amount of weight, but in the group that only slept 5.5 hours a night, only 48% of the weight loss consisted of fat. Contrast that to the group that slept 8.5 hours a night: 80% of their weight loss was fat.How to Fix ItKeep the bedroom quiet, dark, and cold. Along with keeping your sleep environment as dark and quiet as possible, it should be relatively cold. When the room is too warm (upwards of 65 degrees), the body's natural response is to cool itself and sleep quality suffers.Use sleep-aid supplementation. Use a natural supplement like Z-12™ – which contains L-theanine, 5-HTP, and phenibut. The main workhorse in it is PhGABA, which interrupts the flow of stimulatory neurotransmitters that keep you restless and awake. Its other sleep-inducing mechanisms include increased production of the sleepy-time hormone serotonin and brain alpha-wave production, which promotes a relaxed mental state. Some people even use one capsule of Z-12 (instead of 2-3, the normal dosage before bed) for daily stress reduction.Make sleep a priority. The need for sleep varies, but there seems to be a sweet spot between 7 and 8 hours. A study in the journal Sleep analyzed 276 adults between the ages of 21 and 64 for six years and found greater weight gain in those sleeping fewer than 6 hours per night (4.36 pounds) and greater than 9 hours per night (3.48 pounds), compared to those sleeping between 7 and 8.Though one could argue that sleeping too much may be a symptom of weight gain rather than a cause, it's clear that sleeping too little is a problem.

The human cost of insulin in America,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog.At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day.Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness.For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it. One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (Â£210) without health insurance.In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it.Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market.Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%.Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines. The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alec Smith's mother holds a vial of her son's ashes during a protest against the high price of insulin outside Sanofi's offices in Massachusetts Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own.A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured.""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston.She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin.""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC.""There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own. Image copyright Laura Marston Image caption ""I'm not sure I'll ever get over the pain of having to choose my life over our life together,"" Ms Marston says of her dog, Nicky Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her. Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same.""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial.""It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog. So who's to blame? Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers. At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles.List price is set by a pharmaceutical company, and in many cases is what uninsured diabetics payNet price is the actual profit the company receives for a drugRebates are discounts on drugs negotiated for insurance companiesCo-payments are what an insured person pays for a prescription, out-of-pocketDeductibles, which can be as high as $10,000, are what insurance policies say must be paid before the insurer picks up the restInsurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients.This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another.Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket.""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says.But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price. Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"". Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance.""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says.Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012. According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%. And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it.This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand. Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician. Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows.In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer.The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". How does the UK compare?T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK. As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between.""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario.""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries.""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay.""Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. The medical touristsLauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life. Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years.Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help.For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost. More voices on healthcare: The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears.There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too.When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in. Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip. A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. Image copyright Emily Mackey Image caption Emily Mackey holds a stack of insulin pens that she purchased in Mexico But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money.""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" What are the solutions?According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life.Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue.""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity.""Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says.Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet?Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula. Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. Image caption Vials holding the last drops of expired insulin that Laura Marston keeps as her emergency supply But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug.In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"".These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin.Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag.For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications. ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog.""As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure. Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. Image copyright Twitter It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December.The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition. The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system.Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes.As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps.""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died.""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says.""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life.""Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins.",https://t.co/GlrzPDnb4S,news
Lilly to launch a half-price version of insulin,"Boxes of Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Humalog medication sit on a pharmacy shelf in Provo, Utah.George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDrugmaker Eli Lilly announced plans on Monday to sell a half-price version of its popular insulin injection Humalog, as it fends off criticism about rising drug prices in the United States.Major drugmakers including Lilly, a leading producer of insulin, have come under fire from patients and lawmakers over the rising cost of the life-saving medication used to treat diabetes.Lilly's rebranded product would be called Insulin Lispro, it said, while Humalog, which makes $3 billion in annual sales, will remain available for those wishing to access it through existing insurance plans.Other companies, including Gilead Sciences, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, have also announced some price cuts in recent years, as the U.S. government increases scrutiny of the industry and high drug prices remains a major voter concern.The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five-year period, leading some patients to put their own health at risk by rationing the medication because they could not afford out-of-pocket expenses.The list price for Insulin Lispro, to be sold only in the United States, would be $137.35 per vial, Lilly said, adding that could make insulin more affordable for uninsured patients or those with high-deductible insurance plans. ""Today's announcement indicates that Lilly has calculated that the resultant impact of the introduction is at worst, economically neutral with the potential for material political gain,"" Citi analyst Andrew Baum said.The Indianapolis-based drugmaker said it had spoken to various ""stakeholders"" about the price of insulin, including diabetes patients, doctors, advocacy groups, wholesalers and lawmakers. ""For people with diabetes, a lower-priced insulin can serve as a bridge that addresses gaps in the system until a more sustainable model is achieved,"" Lilly Chief Executive Officer David Ricks said in a statement.Two U.S. senators last month launched an investigation into rising insulin prices, writing to Lilly and two other leading manufacturers, asking them why the cost of the nearly 100-year-old medication had rapidly risen.The price of Lilly's Humalog, for instance, rose from $35 to $234 per dose between 2001 and 2015, a 585 percent increase, the senators, Republican Chuck Grassley and Democrat Ron Wyden, had said. The senators did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment on Lilly's announcement.Lilly has in the past called insulin a highly-rebated product. Drugmakers often argue they have to keep prices high because of rebates or after market-discounts they must pay to pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers to get products on their lists of covered drugs.The U.S. government in January proposed a rule to end the industry-wide system of rebates, a change that Lilly says it would welcome.",https://t.co/9Lu74uuhe1,news
Natural Remedies that May Help Prevent or Treat Type 2 Diabetes,"NUTRITIONAL &amp; HERBAL REMEDIES FOR DIABETES &amp; INSULIN RESISTANCEAGRIMONYCommonly known as liverwort, agrimony lowers blood sugar. It is typically used in teas and tinctures.79BILBERRYThe leaf of the bilberry bush (found in North America and Europe) contains anthocyanoside, a flavonoid antioxidant that is known to reduce blood sugar and strengthens blood vessels in eyes (helping prevent damage from diabetic retinopathy). Recommended dosage is 240-360 mg a day in tablets form or teas.79BITTER MELONThis climbing vine with a fruit that resembles a bumpy cucumber is native to southern Asia. In clinical tests it has been shown to lower fasting blood sugar levels and to reduce spikes in blood sugar after eating. Bitter melon achieves this via 2 chemical compounds it contains - polypeptide-p, which acts like insulin to make cells more receptive to take in glucose, and charantin, which stimulates insulin production. It is typically used in whole fruit form, extract, tincture, or juice.79BORAGE OILGamma-linoleic acid in borage oil is a substance that improves circulation through capillaries, like those near hair follicles. One capsule daily is recommended.112BURDOCKThe chromium and fiber in the seeds from this biennial relative of the sunflower that grows in Asia, Europe, and the United States is helpful to diabetics. Chromium regulates blood sugar levels and fiber helps prevent the absorption of sugars from the intestines. Burdock is available in cereal grains, but you can also take 2 to 4 ml of burdock tincture daily, or 1 to 2 grams 3 times a day in capsule form.37However experts advise avoiding burdock if you have a thyroid disorder.79CAJUEROLab tests using a formulation from the bark, stems, nuts and resin of this tropical evergreen tree suggest that cajuero lowers blood sugar by inhibiting the enzyme tyrosinase, which increases cell receptivity to insulin. It is typically used as a tinctured liquid form, and may take 3-4 weeks to achieve lower blood sugar.79CHANCA PIEDRAClinical trials in India have shown that taking formulations from this tropical plant (also known as the kidney stone tree) for a week lowered blood sugar levels in diabetics. It also inhibits the creation of sorbitol from excess glucose, the neurotoxin that causes nerve and eye damage in diabetics and is typically used in tablet and tincture form.79CHIAHistorically consumed by the Tohono O'odham Native American tribes of the Sonoran Desert area, Salvia hispanica was often combined with legumes. It is high in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, and antioxidants such as quercetin, caffeic acid, and kaempferol, and helps maintain healthy blood sugar levels.117CHROMIUMA mineral involved in the proper management of insulin and glucose levels, one doctor with the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center recommends 400-600 mg/day of chromium with medical supervision.112CINNAMONResults of a clinical study showed that 1, 3, or 6 mg (.2 to 1.2 teaspoons) a day of cinnamon noticeably reduced blood glucose levels.118EVENING PRIMROSE OILGamma-linoleic acid in evening primrose oil is a substance that improves circulation through capillaries, like those near hair follicles. The recommended dosage is 2-6 capsules daily.112FENUGREEKUsed in ancient Egypt for mummification and in ancient Greece, India, and Arab countries medicinally, the chemical composition of the leaves and seeds of this clover-like herb offers many health benefits. Clinical studies in India have shown that 25 mg/day lowers blood glucose levels.79, 119.GINSENGA perennial herb, varieties of which are native to shaded areas in the United States and Asia (the Siberian ginseng is not a true ginseng; it is a different species) is known to improve fasting blood sugar levels. However experts advise avoiding both types of ginseng if you have a thyroid disorder.79, 118GUAR GUMExtracted from the guar bean, grown primarily in India and Pakistan, guar gum reduces blood sugar levels.118JAMBULSeeds from this long-living tropical evergreen native to India, Pakistan, and Southeast Asian countries have been shown to lower blood sugar and also possess anti-inflammatory qualities. Using 2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons in cooking daily is recommended.79MAGNESIUMStudies in Brazil have shown that magnesium helps diabetics maintain normal blood glucose levels. 20-30 mg daily is recommended.112REHMANNIAAlso known as Chinese RR and Di Huang, the roots and aerial parts of Rehmannia glutinosa are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Japanese herbal medicine to lower blood sugar levels (confirmed in animal studies). It also has anti-inflammatory echinacosides and purpureaside C.120ZINC Diabetics have been shown to excrete zinc in urine, and studies have shown that zinc-deprived animals develop high blood sugar, so zinc supplements may be helpful in maintaining appropriate zinc levels. 30-50 mg/day is recommended (over 30 mg with medical supervision only).112",https://t.co/PW1LWRk3K8,news
Shots - Health News,"Eli Lilly and Company, based in Indianapolis, is rolling out a half-price version of its insulin Humalog that will be sold as a generic. Darron Cummings/AP hide caption toggle caption Darron Cummings/AP Eli Lilly and Company, based in Indianapolis, is rolling out a half-price version of its insulin Humalog that will be sold as a generic. Darron Cummings/AP When Erin Gilmer filled her insulin prescription at a Denver-area Walgreens in January, she paid $8.50. U.S. taxpayers paid another $280.51. She thinks the price of insulin is too high. ""It eats at me to know that taxpayer money is being wasted,"" says Gilmer, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes while a sophomore at the University of Colorado in 2002. The diagnosis meant that for the rest of her life she'd require daily insulin shots to stay alive. But the price of that insulin is skyrocketing. Between 2009 and 2017 the wholesale price of a single vial of Humalog, the Eli Lilly and Company-manufactured insulin Gilmer uses, nearly tripled — rising from $92.70 to $274.70, according to data from IBM Watson Health. Six years ago, Gilmer qualified for Social Security Disability Insurance — and thus, Medicare — because of a range of health issues. At the time, the insulin she needed cost $167.70 per vial, according to IBM Watson Health. ""When it's taxpayer money paying for medication for someone like me, it makes it a national issue, not just a diabetic issue,"" Gilmer says. Stories about people with Type 1 diabetes dying when they couldn't afford insulin have made headlines. Patient advocates like Gilmer have protested high prices outside Lilly's headquarters in Indianapolis. Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Last October in Minnesota, then state Attorney General Lori Swanson sued insulin manufacturers alleging price gouging. Pharmaceutical executives were grilled about high drug prices by the Senate Finance Committee on Feb. 26. This is the backdrop for Lilly saying Monday that it is rolling out a half-priced, generic version of Humalog called ""insulin lispro."" The list price: $137.35 per vial. ""Patients, doctors and policymakers are demanding lower list prices for medicines and lower patient costs at the pharmacy counter,"" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks wrote in a blog post about the move. ""You might be surprised to hear that we agree – it's time for change in our system and for consumer prices to come down."" No panacea When Lilly's Humalog, the first short-acting insulin, came to market in 1996, the list price was about $21 per vial. The price didn't reach $275 overnight, but yearly price increases added up. In February 2009, for example, the wholesale price was $92.70, according to IBM Watson Health. It rose to $99.65 in December 2009, then to $107.60 in Sept. 2010, $115.70 in May 2011, and so on. ""There's no justification for why prices should keep increasing at an average rate of 10 percent every year,"" says Inmaculada Hernandez of the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy who was lead author of a January report in Health Affairs attributing the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs to accumulated yearly price hikes. ""The public perception that we have in general is that drugs are so expensive because we need to pay for research and development, and that's true,"" Hernandez says. ""However, usually research and development is paid for in the first years of life of a drug"" At $137.35 per vial, Lilly's generic insulin is priced at about the same level as Humalog was in 2012, 16 years after it came to market. ""We want to recognize that this is not a panacea,"" says company spokesman Greg Kueterman. ""This is an option that we hope can help people in the current system that we work with."" It's worth noting that Humalog is a rapid-acting insulin, but that's only one of the two types of insulin most people with Type 1 diabetes use every day. The second kind is long-lasting. Lilly makes one called Basaglar. The most popular long-lasting insulin is Lantus, produced by Sanofi. Neither has a lower-cost alternative. Still, Lilly's move on Humalog could put pressure on the other two big makers of insulin to act. Novo Nordisk called Lilly's lower-priced generic insulin ""an important development,"" in an emailed statement. ""Bringing affordable insulin to the market requires ideas from all stakeholders,"" Novo Nordisk's Ken Inchausti said in an email, which also listed steps the company has taken, such as a patient assistance program. The statement didn't say whether Novo Nordisk is considering offering a lower-priced version of its popular insulin Novolog, a rival of Humalog. A statement from Sanofi, the third major insulin maker, also didn't say whether the company would offer lower-priced version of its insulins. ""Sanofi supports any actions that increase access to insulins for patients living with diabetes at an affordable price,"" spokesperson Ashleigh Koss said in the email, which also touted the company's patient assistance program. A different kind of generic One twist in this story is that Lilly's new insulin is just a repackaged version of Humalog, minus the brand name. It's called an ""authorized generic."" ""Whoever came up with the term, 'authorized generic' ?"" Dr. Vincent Rajkumar says laughing. Rajkumar is a hematologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""It's the same exact drug"" as the brand name, he continues. Typically, Rajkumar says, authorized generics are introduced by brand-name drugmakers to compete with generic versions of their drugs made by rival companies. But in the case of Humalog and other insulins, there are no generics made by competitors, as there are for, say, the cholesterol medicine Lipitor or even other diabetes drugs, such as metformin. So when Lilly's authorized generic comes to market, the company will have both Humalog insulin and the authorized generic version of that medicine on the market. Rajkumar says it's a public relations move. ""There's outrage over the price of insulin that is being discussed in Congress and elsewhere. And so the company basically says, 'Hey, we will make the identical product available at half price.' On the surface that sounds great,"" Rajkumar says. ""But you look at the problems and you think, 'OK, how crazy is this that someone is actually going to be buying the brand-name drug?' "" In fact, it's possible that Lilly could make the same or even more profit off its authorized generic than it does from the name-brand Humalog, according to University of Pittsburgh's Hernandez. The profit margin would depend on the rebates paid by the company to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. Rebates are getting a lot of attention these days as one factor in rising drug prices. They're usually not disclosed and increase as a drug's price increases providing an incentive to some ""Doing an authorized generic is nothing else than giving insurers two options,"" Hernandez says: Pay the full list price for a brand-name drug and receive a higher rebate, or pay the lower price for the authorized generic and receive a presumably smaller rebate. ""What we really need to get insulin prices down is to get generics into the market, and we need more than one,"" Hernandez says, adding that previous research has shown that prices begin to go down when two or three generics are competing in the marketplace. Even so, Lillly's Kueterman says the authorized generic insulin ""is going to help hopefully move the system towards a more sustainable model."" ""I can guarantee you the reason that we're doing this is to help people,"" Kueterman says, noting the company's Diabetes Solution Center has also helped ""10,000 people each month pay significantly less for their insulin"" since it opened in August 2018. For Erin Gilmer, the news about an authorized generic insulin from Lilly has left her mildly encouraged. ""It sounds really good and it will help some people, which is great,"" Gilmer says. ""It's Eli Lilly and pharma starting to understand that grassroots activism has to be taken seriously, and we are at a tipping point.""

A Diabetes Home Test Can Be a Waste of Time and Money,"Still, not everyone is on board. Critics of this most recent trial said it didn't prove that blood glucose monitoring couldn't help: It's possible that with better training, or more attention to detail, there might be ways to make this work.The point of pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials like this, though, is to test how practices work in the real world. In these high-quality primary care practices, even with customized help in interpreting the measurements (which is more than most patients get), testing blood sugar didn't make a difference.Choosing Wisely, an educational campaign aiming to reduce unnecessary medical tests and procedures, advises against routine home glucose monitoring for patients with Type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. It says there is no benefit, and that there are potential harms (a study has shown an association with increased anxiety and depression). This argument is supported by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Society of General Internal Medicine and the Endocrine Society.Of course, there are exceptions. When patients are acutely ill, or changing regimens, or finding that their blood sugar is not well controlled, testing may be appropriate. Such decisions should be made in consultation with a physician.But for most people with Type 2 diabetes not on insulin, testing is inappropriate most of the time. That message is not getting through. At the end of last year, another study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine that quantified the prevalence of glucose testing in adults. Researchers examined a database that contained data on more than 370,000 commercial health insurance and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who had Type 2 diabetes.Of the more than 23 percent of patients who were using testing strips, more than half were probably doing so in spite of widespread recommendations that they shouldn't. They were using a median of two testing strips a day at a cost of more than $325 per year per patient.On another front, The New York Times has reported that ""a surprisingly large number of people"" who use insulin are using less because they can't afford it, putting themselves in danger.With a health care system as complicated as ours, it's hard to take money from one pot and shift it easily to another. Efficiency in each system is crucial. The fact that a necessary facet of diabetes care is increasingly out of reach — while unnecessary and potentially harmful care is easily overused — illustrates how much work still needs to be done.",https://t.co/RaVqpDGgpY,news
A Government Guide to Keeping Insulin Unaffordable,"If you've heard anything about insulin lately, it's probably been palpable outrage over soaring prescription prices or dubious optimism about Eli Lilly's recent release of its new version that, at half the price, will cost an arm or a leg but not both.Amid this cesspool of indignant commentary, you're likely to hear one of the biggest misconceptions around: that markets, competition, or capitalism have failed to respond to the patient's need in creating more affordable insulin. What you won't hear is how pharma giants have enlisted the FDA, the DEA, the FBI, customs and border security, and a dozen other taxpayer-funded regulatory and enforcement agencies to protect their profit margins.If anything, the draconian constraints demonstrate just how diligently market competition brings down prices and how hamstrung and hogtied competition must be before it stops performing its essential functions.When studying markets, economists like to imagine hypothetical ""perfect competition, the economic equivalent of physics' frictionless plane. In perfect competition, many suppliers and demanders exchange the same product, buyers and sellers can find each other and switch products without added cost, and no barriers prevent new suppliers from entering the market to offer equivalent goods. If a perfect competition market is the hypothetical free-market heaven, the American insulin market is literal hell.Step 1: Limit the Number of SuppliersEven though insulin treatment itself can't be patented, improvements in delivery mechanisms can be. These incremental improvements, no matter how small, can be used to extend the 20-year patent on a drug, a process called ""patent evergreening. Sanofi has filed 74 patent applications on its long-acting insulin Lantusâ€""nearly all of them after the drug was on the marketâ€""and boxed out generics for decades. Drug makers seek extensions to their exclusivity when they add pill coatings and alter inactive ingredients, extending their monopoly but offering no marginal advantage to patients.Regulators and pharma CEOs aren't opposing forces; they're the same peopleâ€""sometimes literally. Nearly half of staff reviewers at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will go on to take jobs in the industries they're tasked with regulating, often as advisors in navigating regulatory policy.Research into the ""revolving door phenomenon was summarized by one scholar.When you know 60 percent of your colleagues who leave go to work for the industry, it may make you more likely to be the kind of regulator that gets along well with the industry, helps them shepherd drugs through, and doesn't push too hard on the warts in a trial.Alex Azar is a former Eli Lilly executive whose ten-year tenure there coincided with a quadrupling of the list price for its synthetic insulin. He is now our secretary of Health and Human Services.FDA reviewers who expect to go into industry jobs want to make friends with the big guys, and that means shutting out the small fries. The stakes are high: The LA Times reportsÂ that a single generic competitor, once approved, drops the price of a patented drug about 30 percent. Two competing formulas cut the name brand price by 90 percent. Patents and FDA regulations don't just exclude US competitors, but block imports of cheaper medicines available from other countries.To keep market forces from cutting their shareholder returns, big brands pressure regulators to exclude generics.Patents and FDA regulations don't just exclude US competitors, but they also block imports of cheaper medicines available from other countries. If patients now travel to Europe or Mexico to obtain cheaper insulinâ€""apparently enough to offset travel costsâ€""why is it illegal to import those affordable alternatives? Even if a factory makes the same insulin for both Canadian and US markets, the foreign maker is forbidden to sell to American patients. Recent legislation has been introduced in Congress to allow imports from Canada, where standards are similar to the FDA's but insulin is far cheaper. Even if the bill passes, imports can be blocked by the secretary of Health and Human Servicesâ€""the same one who until recently was an Eli Lilly executive.Step 2: Exclude Competing ProductsEven when cheaper analogs have been approved by regulators in Canada or Europe, and outcomes are clinically indistinguishable for most patients, the FDA drags its feet for years. Innovators and biomedical researchers faced with insurmountable costs are likely to drop a new project or sell it to an existing giant with the legal staff to carry the load. That legal team, remember, includes several former FDA staffers more than capable of burying a potential competitor in a decade of official busywork.Insulin makers simply split the profitsÂ with anyone who tries to topple their monopoly, which buys them another few years of protection.Another option to exclude competing products is to maximize the startup costs to new suppliers, discouraging new players. Any new drug must endure an FDA clinical trial and approval gauntlet that, according to independent reports, takes an average of 12 years and $2.7 billion to complete. Those costs must be paid by the manufacturer hoping to bring the drug to market, and only a handful of companies can raise enough.Pay-for-delay settlements are an ugly consequence of a previous attempt to legislate lower drug prices. When smaller, generic manufacturers want to offer cheaper versions of a brand-name drug, its original maker will threaten costly litigation, which lower-margin producers can't afford. Then they offer a way out, a ""reverse settlement by which name brands can (legally!) pay smaller companies not to bring a generic drug to market.The hush money buys brands another few years of protection for their soaring profit margins. Insulin makers simply split the profits of their monopoly with anyone who tries to topple it.Step 3: Hide and Distort Prices so No One Can Shop AroundPatients, and indeed prescribers, have only the foggiest idea of what products are available and their real per-unit cost. Manufacturers like to boast that no one pays ""list price: Patients rely on a patchwork of health insurance, pharmacy discounts, and manufacturer rebates to bring the cost within reach. Such a complicated framework provides a wide scope for manipulation.Prices paid by patients have risen steadily for a decade, but the price paid by health care actors has fallen. Pharma companies steeply discount the negotiated prices paid by pharmacies, benefits directors, and health insurers. Insulin is re-priced as many as four times other than the ""list price before it can be purchased by a consumer. At each stage, the reimbursement is based on a percentage of the list price. So the higher the list price, the better the returns for each participant in the processâ€""even if no patient ever pays the list price.Government agencies and corporations conspire to deny patients the benefits of market competition.Even shadier is the practice of offering steep discounts to insurance companies, benefits managers, prescribers, and other employees whose job is to decide (and limit) which insulin products covered patients can buy. Insurers and health plans pay a negotiated price well below the list cost but often well above what patients will pay. The difference, a percentage of that inflated list price, serves as a kickback from drug companies to anyone who will drive patients toward their priciest products. Class action lawsuits in Minnesota, New Jersey, Washington, and New Mexico are exposing the systematic manipulation of insulin prices by manufacturers, insurers, and pharmacies.Through this nebulous network of bully tactics and insider dealings, government agencies and corporate campaign donors conspire to deny patients the benefits of market competition. Desperate patients pay up because they have nowhere else to goâ€""and their distress is deliberate and designed.",https://t.co/2mdMvDeWwC,news
"Hacking pacemakers, insulin pumps and patients' vital signs in real time","Medical device insecurity was covered at the recent Black Hat and Def Con security conferences in Las Vegas. One set of researchers showed off hacks to pacemakers and insulin pumps that could potentially prove lethal, while another researcher explained how hospital patients' vital signs could be falsified in real time.Pacemaker and insulin pump hacks at Black Hat USAA decade has passed since we learned about pacemaker hacks, but still implantable medical devices that can save patients' lives can be hacked to potentially kill them. Even now, as was highlighted at Black Hat USA, attackers can cause pacemakers to deliver a deadly shock to the heart or deny a life-saving shock, as well as prevent insulin pumps from delivering needed insulin.After asking attendees with implanted medical devices to leave the room, researchers Billy Rios of WhiteScope and Jonathan Butts of QED Secure Solutions demonstrated how attackers could remotely install malicious firmware on a device used by doctors to control their patients' pacemakers. That's due to the lack of encryption in Medtronic's firmware update process. The duo also discussed vulnerabilities in Medtronic's network infrastructure for software deliveries.They showed how it was possible to compromise Medtronic's CareLink 2090 programmer, a programming device that runs on Windows XP and is used by doctors to control patients' implanted pacemakers. They demonstrated two hacks that ultimately changed the programming so it would harm patients with pacemakers. Butts explained, ""You can obviously issue a shock, but you can also deny a shock.""The firmware is not digitally signed, and updates sent to the programmers are not delivered via an encrypted HTTPS connection. Medtronic basically blew off the malicious reprogramming threat as being a ""low risk"" and impractical attack. Making sure there is no hack is something doctors can allegedly do. If it weren't so sad, that response would be funny considering how many patients have been affected by data breaches or hospitals slammed with ransomware.Rios and Butts are critical of Medtronic's responses, pointing out how far it would go to safeguard patients if only Medtronic would digitally sign their code.But wait, there's more because the researchers also showed off a hack against a Medtronic insulin pump. Using software-defined radio, they demonstrated how to stop a scheduled dose of insulin from being delivered. Conversely, as pointed out by ICS-CERT, ""An attacker can capture the wireless transmissions between the remote controller and the pump and replay them to cause an insulin (bolus) delivery.""ICS-CERT posted advisories about all the following Medtronic devices: MiniMed 508 insulin pump, MyCareLink 24950 and 24952 patient monitor, Carelink 2090 programmer and N'Vision clinician programmer, and here is the list of Medtronic security bulletins. The really long, full statement issued by Medtronic can be seen here.Def Con researcher explains how to falsify a patient's vitals in real timeNo embedded medical devices, no worries? That's not necessarily true if you are a patient in a hospital, as a researcher showed how a patient's vitals could be falsified in real time, leading to medication or treatments that patients don't need.Before coming up with real-world attack scenarios, Doug McKee, senior security researcher at McAfee's Advanced Threat Research team, consulted Dr. Shaun Nordeck to determine how important the accuracy of patients' vital signs is to doctors. Dr. Nordeck said, ""Vital signs are integral to clinical decision making."" Not all medical professions go running into every one of their patients' hospital rooms to verify monitored vitals before making critical decisions about treatment.At Def Con, McKee discussed a ""weakness in the RWHAT protocol, one of the networking protocols used by medical devices to monitor a patient's condition. This protocol is utilized in some of the most critical systems used in hospitals."" He demonstrated how the weakness could be exploited by an attacker in real time to modify the communications in-transit to provide false information. ""Lack of authentication also allows rogue devices to be placed onto the network and mimic patient monitors,"" he said.McAfee has posted two videos showing vitals being modified in real time. One shows spoofing a patient's heartbeat to flatline, and the other shows modifying a normal heartbeat to an extremely high level, which could influence medical decisions.Explaining the impact of the attack, Dr. Nordeck said, ""Fictitious cardiac rhythms, even intermittent, could lead to extended hospitalization, additional testing, and side effects from medications prescribed to control heart rhythm and/or prevent clots. The hospital could also suffer resource consumption.""McKee suggested that vendors encrypt network traffic between devices and add authentication, as it would add levels of difficulty to successfully pulling off attacks that can falsify patient data.",https://t.co/9d0KQeoZvN,news
Is it better to reduce basal insulin rate or remove insulin pump before exercise in type 1 diabetes?,"Posted by Medivizor on Mar 12, 2019 in Diabetes mellitus | In a nutshell The aim of this study was to investigate if reducing basal insulin rate (BRR) 90-minutes before exercise was better at preventing hypoglycemia (dangerously low blood glucose) than suspending the insulin pump (pump suspension; PS) in type 1 diabetes (T1D). The main finding was that BRR 90-minutes before exercise improved blood glucose control and reduced hypoglycemia compared to PS.Some background Insulin is the treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D). It is a hormone that lowers blood glucose. Insulin treatment is made up of basal insulin and mealtime insulin. Basal insulin controls blood glucose between meals. Mealtime insulin controls blood glucose after meals. Insulin can be delivered continuously through a pump that is controlled by the patient (open-loop insulin pump).Exercise is an important part of T1D treatment. It lowers the risk of heart disease and improves overall wellbeing. However, during exercise, the body uses more glucose. Therefore, patients must take actions to prevent blood glucose from going too low (hypoglycemia). These actions include: eating more carbohydrates, reducing basal insulin rate (BRR) before exercise or disconnecting their insulin pump during exercise (PS). It is not known if BRR or PS is better at controlling blood sugar after exercise in T1D.Methods &amp; findings This study included 17 patients that had T1D and an open-loop insulin pump. Patients completed three 60-minute treadmill exercise sessions. During the first session patients removed their pump when they began exercise. For the second session, patients reduced their basal insulin by 80% 90-minutes before exercise. For the third session, they reduced their basal insulin by 50% 90-minutes before exercise.Blood glucose level was significantly higher with BRR 50% at the start of exercise. At the end of exercise, BRR 80% had the smallest drop in blood glucose levels (-31 mg/dL) compared to 50% BRR (-47 mg/dL) and PS (-67 mg/dL). With PS group, 7 out of the 17 patients developed hypoglycemia compared to only 1 out of 17 with both BRR. After a standard meal post-exercise, blood glucose rose with PS and 50% BRR but did not rise with 80% BRR.The bottom line The authors concluded that, compared to PS, 50-80% BRR 90-minutes before exercise, improves blood glucose control and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. They also determined that it does not compromise post-exercise meal blood glucose control.The fine print This study was funded by Insulet Canada Corporation and Insulet Corporation, the developers of insulin pumps. This study involved a very small number of patients. Larger studies are needed.What's next? If you have any concerns about managing T1D, please consult with your doctor.Published By :Diabetes CareOriginal Title :Improved Open-Loop Glucose Control With Basal Insulin Reduction 90 Minutes Before Aerobic Exercise in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes on Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion.

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve.

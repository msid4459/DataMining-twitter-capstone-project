"Diabetes drug may prevent, slow kidney disease, study finds","Breaking News EmailsGet breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.SUBSCRIBEApril 15, 2019, 1:48 PM UTCBy Associated PressA drug that's used to help control blood sugar in people with diabetes has now been shown to help prevent or slow kidney disease, which causes millions of deaths each year and requires hundreds of thousands of people to use dialysis to stay alive.Doctors say it's hard to overstate the importance of this study, and what it means for curbing this problem, which is growing because of the obesity epidemic.The study tested Janssen Pharmaceuticals' drug Invokana. Results were discussed Sunday at a medical meeting in Australia and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.About 30 million Americans and more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes, and most cases are Type 2, the kind tied to obesity. It occurs when the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, which turns food into energy.This can damage the kidneys over time, causing disease and ultimately, failure. In the U.S., it's responsible for nearly half a million people needing dialysis, and for thousands of kidney transplants each year.Some blood pressure drugs lower this risk but they're only partially effective. The new study tested Invokana, a daily pill sold now to help control blood sugar, to see if it also could help prevent kidney disease when added to standard treatments.For the study, about 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease from around the world were to be given Invokana or dummy pills. Independent monitors stopped the study early, after 4,400 people had been treated for about 2.5 years on average, when it was clear the drug was helping.Those on the drug had a 30 percent lower risk of one of these problems — kidney failure, need for dialysis, need for a kidney transplant, death from kidney- or heart-related causes, or other signs that kidneys were failing.For every 1,000 people taking the drug for 2.5 years, there would be 47 fewer cases of one of these problems, researchers estimate.Rates of serious side effects were similar in the drug and placebo groups including leg, foot or toe amputations, a concern raised by a previous study of Invokana. One side effect, when the body can't produce enough insulin, was more frequent among those on Invokana but rare overall.Janssen, which is part of Johnson &amp; Johnson, sponsored the study and many authors work or consult for the company. The drug costs about $500 a month in the U.S. Out-of-pocket costs for patients may be different, depending on insurance.The importance of this large and well-done study ""cannot be overstated,"" Drs. Julie Ingelfinger and Clifford Rosen, editors at the medical journal, wrote in an accompanying article.In recent years, several studies have found that Invokana and some similar drugs can lower heart risks. The new results, showing that Invokana also may stall or prevent kidney failure, expand the potential benefits of the drug.",https://t.co/h61VSoiNbi,news
Diabetes: What you should eat to keep your blood sugar level in control,"Diabetes in a major cause of blindness, stroke, and even kidney failure. (Photo: Thinkstock)According to the World Health Organisation, over 100 million people in the world are diagnosed with diabetes because of unhealthy eating habits, improper diet, stress, and obesity. A major cause of blindness, diabetes can also lead to stroke, kidney failure, heart attacks, and lower limb amputation.Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose, so that it can be transformed into energy for various activities. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes the hormone insulin to help glucose enter the cells of our body. However, if a person has diabetes the body either does not produce enough insulin or cannot use the insulin produced.""The Glycemic Index, or GI, measures how a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose. Food low in GI is good for maintaining the blood glucose level,"" says dietitian Jasleen Kaur, founder and mentor, Just Diet Clinic.She adds that since black beans are low in GI, they are called the super food in diabetes. Black beans, with a GI level of less than 55, helps maintain the blood glucose levels. Some other foods with low GI levels are oatmeal, oat bran, muesli, bran, peas, and legumes,"" she says while sharing a few things people suffering from diabetes should and should not do, and the foods they should consume to maintain their blood sugar levels.What to eat to maintain your blood sugar levels:Karela juice is extremely beneficial for diabetics.

Amazon's Alexa can handle patient information now - what does that mean for privacy?,"Last week, Amazon announced that Alexa-enabled devices are now able to handle patient information. It's an exciting update that could make aspects of health care more accessible, but questions remain around privacy and how Amazon will (or won't) be able to use the data it now has access to. Typically, health care workers can only share a patient's health information with the patient and others in the health care system, according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). That means that a business like Amazon, which is not explicitly a health care company, wouldn't be able to handle this data. Now, Amazon says that Alexa is able to follow HIPAA guidelines, and it has already invited six health companies to develop voice programs (""or skills"") using its Alexa system. Customers of those organizations can use Alexa to make an appointment or access personal medical information like blood sugar readings. ""There's no 'Good Housekeeping' seal of approval"" or formal process to prove that someone is now HIPAA compliantNow that Alexa is allowed to handle this data, what can it do with it? The answer depends on the specific agreements between Amazon and a given partner — which means that there's a lot we don't know yet. In the case of Livongo, the company whose voice skill lets users check their blood sugar reading, Alexa is mostly a way to transmit the information. When a patient asks Alexa to check their blood sugar reading, the device accesses that data from the Livongo cloud and tells the patient. But the patient information is stored with Livongo and Amazon can't do anything with it, says Livongo chief product officer Amar Kendale. (The Verge reached out to all six companies developing voice skills. Many were not available or redirected data use questions to Amazon, whose reps did not answer questions as of press time.)In other cases, the situation could be different. Pamela Hepp, co-chair of the Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Group at Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney, says that it is possible that patient information could be shared and used to train one of Amazon's artificial intelligence algorithms. Again, it depends on the agreement. The HIPAA Privacy Rule does require written authorization before someone's health information can be used for marketing, adds Hepp, but what constitutes ""marketing"" is not as straightforward as one might think. For example, a company could theoretically use a patient's information to provide them with info about new services, even if that service isn't related to the patient's health needs. In these cases, Alexa could be used to communicate that information, though Alexa couldn't market Amazon's own products. It's also important to note that there is no official certification process for becoming HIPAA compliant. ""There's no Good Housekeeping seal of approval"" or formal process to prove that someone is now HIPAA compliant, according to Hepp. Rather, it is a self-implemented process. Companies must be able to follow various HIPAA requirements, like the Privacy Rule, Breach Notification Rule, and Security Rule. Of these, the Security Rule can be the most difficult for companies to follow. The Security Rule covers topics such as encryption and having proper controls related to who can access which types of information. To comply with the Security Rule, companies need to have a ""robust security infrastructure"" in place, explains Charlotte Tschider, a health law expert at DePaul University. This can be expensive for large companies, especially if they're using older technology that needs to be updated. Though there is no agency that certifies whether a company is actually following HIPAA, both Tschider and Hepp point out that the Office for Civil Rights, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Trade Commission are both able to investigate allegations of HIPAA violations. A lot of good could come out of this change, says Tschider. ""This could be really, really beneficial for consumers,"" she adds. ""Historically, the harder it is to see a doctor, the less likely someone is to get care. The less access someone has to things that could improve their health, the less likely they are to tweak it."" Kendale of Livongo, for instance, hopes that the new Alexa skill will make it easier for patients with diabetes to make smart nutritional choices, especially when they're away from their blood glucose monitor. For example, a patient standing in the kitchen can ask Alexa for their last blood sugar reading and use that information to choose between two foods. Providence St. Joseph Health is another company working with Amazon; their Alexa voice skill lets the customer find an urgent care center nearby and make a same-day appointment. ""I personally believe that voice is going to be a big, big deal in healthcare,"" says Aaron Martin, chief innovation officer at Providence St. Joseph. They chose to build this particular skill because ""we wanted to find the broadest use case possible,"" Martin says. ""The hope is that we get a lot of patients using the skill and it allows them to iterate and learn much faster about how to use the skill in a healthcare standpoint."" (Martin declined to comment on Providence St. Joseph's data use agreement with Amazon.) Still, Hepp points out that the more ""entry points"" there are into a medical system, the more risk there is for a cybersecurity breach. And Tschider says she's concerned about the details of what is in those data use agreements: ""I'm concerned about how a very large organization that also sells me stuff is going to use my health information.""",https://t.co/ZfGAQA4Vss,news

Diabetes Management: 5 Desi Diabetes-Friendly Foods That May Help Prevent Blood Sugar Spikes,"HighlightsDiabetes is a common metabolic disorderDiabetics should be very cautious of their dietFibre-rich foods help stabilise blood sugar levelsDiabetes is becoming one of the biggest health scares around the world. The metabolic disorder which used to affect only a select few a while back has now afflicted countless youth and middle-aged men and women too. Diabetes is defined as a condition in which the body's blood sugar levels are abnormally high. The spike in blood sugar occurs either because the body is not producing enough insulin or it is not able to respond well to the insulin produced. It is estimated that by the year 2030, 98 million Indians would be diabetic. Diabetics need to be extra careful of their diet. They should include food that is high on fibre content. Fibre enables slow release of sugar in the bloodstream that prevents abnormal spikes. Diabetics should also steer clear of refined carbohydrates and processed junk; they metabolise fast and cause blood sugar fluctuations.Here are some desi ingredients you are likely to find in any regular Indian kitchen. Eating them may do wonders for your diabetes management. 1. KuttuKuttu or buckwheat is a healthy gluten-free pseudo grain, which is used extensively in vrat preparations. According to the book 'Healing Foods' by DK Publishing House, ""the grain contains slow-release carbohydrates that help maintain steady blood sugar levels. It is abundant in magnesium and manganese, both of which are necessary for carbohydrate metabolism. Kuttu also has a low glycemic index (between 49-51), which makes it an excellent diabetic-friendly food. (Also Read: 11 Best Buckwheat Recipes | Best Kuttu Recipes)Diabetes Foods: Kuttu or buckwheat is a healthy gluten-free pseudo grain2. RagiAccording to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), diabetics should consume at least half of their grains as whole grains.

This bark extract helps support blood sugar levels,"Terry Naturally Published 6:00 a.m. ET April 3, 2019 | Updated 6:00 a.m. ET April 5, 2019Want an assist for healthy A1c levels? There's a formula for that. You already know how important it is to maintain healthy blood sugar levels lower than 140 mg/dL and A1C levels below 5.7%. At a certain age, it becomes necessary to begin thinking about sugar consumption and its effects on the body.By the way, if you've ever wondered how sugar became public enemy No. 1, it's really a question of food processing, snack availability and an increase in sedentary lifestyles. For instance, according the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in the 1950s, individuals consumed about 100 pounds of sugar annually. Today, that number has virtually doubled. Corn syrup, the prime ingredient in most soft drinks, barely made a dent in our diets in the 1970s; back then, we consumed only about 5 pounds of it annually. But these days, that amount has ballooned to 64 pounds per person each year — it's everywhere.If you're already following a sensible diet and exercise regimen to support balanced blood sugar levels, that's excellent. But for a little support, there's a special herbal extract that can help your efforts go even further.This clinically studied wonder comes from a botanical known as Hintonia latiflora. Although it has seen more than 60 years of research and use in Europe, it originates from Mexico and Central America. This shrub-like tree has white trumpet-shaped fragrant flowers and withstands a very harsh climate. This resilience actually helps create and concentrate the powerful compounds that have made it so highly regarded: The tough external conditions have the effect of strengthening the plant's own protective compounds. This is normal in plants — the very components in them that are good for us as antioxidants, for example, are born from adversity. They're there primarily to fight for the plant's well-being. It just so happens that they're good for us, too — sometimes in surprising ways.One of the compounds in Hintonia latiflora fits that description exactly. Its bark contains a polyphenol with the unwieldy name ""coutareagenin,"" which helps support healthy blood sugar levels.*† Research surrounding Hintonia and this compound — and there has been a lot of research in the past 60 years — shows that it modulates an enzyme that releases sugar from carbohydrates. This has the effect of allowing people to experience even-keeled blood sugar levels throughout the day, versus the up-and-down spikes that can affect your energy and mood.If this situation sounds at all familiar, a clinically studied form of Hintonia, available in a supplement called Sucontral® D from Terry Naturally®, may be exactly the right addition to your regimen. Containing Hintonia extract plus synergistic vitamins and minerals, it is the same formula used in successful clinical studies. And that's one of the things that makes this supplement so different; although there are certainly plenty of products out there touting claims, Sucontral D has solid science to back it up.In one of the clinical studies, adult participants added Sucontral D to their regimens for six months — a pretty typical time frame for testing botanical ingredients and other nutrients. At the end of the study period, in every crucial measure, Sucontral D significantly and dramatically supported quality of life measures associated with healthy blood sugar balance.*† It also supported healthy cholesterol and triglyceride balance — both important and often related factors to healthy insulin function.*†These results are consistent with other clinical research showing similar results; Sucontral D supports carbohydrate metabolism, healthy A1C levels and insulin function, and balanced blood sugar levels throughout the day.*† A1C levels are an especially important aspect of healthy blood sugar. They measure levels of sugar in the hemoglobin – the protein that carries oxygen in the red blood cells over time.If you're just getting started on a healthy blood sugar regimen, it might seem like your food choices are limited. But nothing could be further from the truth. That's because wholesome, real food is the best for a healthy life, no matter what. So what does a shopping list for healthy blood sugar levels look like? A bit like this:EggsUnprocessed meats: beef, pork, lamb, chicken, turkey and duckTrout, salmon, cod, shrimp and tunaVegetables including broccoli, cabbage, spinach, cauliflower, carrots, celery, peppers, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, beets and leafy greens for extra fiber and nutrientsNatural, non-hydrolyzed fats, including butter, coconut oil, olive oil and avocadoNuts such as almonds, walnuts, macadamias, pecans and sunflower seedsYou'll notice that this list is big on unprocessed, unsweetened options that taste delicious and support your best efforts.Of course, maintaining healthy blood sugar levels requires a full-time commitment. The work that you do by eating good foods and getting daily exercise is critical. But it's helpful to know that you have a partner in your efforts from a well-studied, safe and effective botanical extract that has shown positive results for several decades. You can find Sucontral D at your favorite health food store or from Terry Naturally Vitamins.†Supports healthy levels already within normal range.*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Scientists reveal eating this cheese every day could help lower your blood pressure,"A little-known Italian cheese could help lower the risk of high blood pressure by taking the stress off over-worked blood vessels and vital organs. Grana Padano cheese is a semi-fat hard cheese similar to parmesan and contains amino acids that relax blood vessels, which subsequently reduces risk of hypertension. Eating just an ounce of Grana Padano cheese every day for two months could lower your blood pressure by as much as 8/7mmHg, Italian scientists said. It also wouldn't have any impact on your body mass index or your blood sugar levels, the scientists claimed, reports the Express . ""The effects are similar to what you would expect with antihypertensive medications,"" said researcher Dr Giuseppe Crippa, from the Hypertension Unit of Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital and Catholic University. ""Adding a little Grana Padano to a healthy diet may provide clinically significant blood pressure lowering benefits."" You could still eat the cheese if you're lactose intolerant, as it's completely lactose-free, said Grana Padano. Meanwhile, you could also lower your blood pressure by regularly eating eggs, it's been claimed. Eggs are rich in protein, and eating large amounts of protein appears to be linked to a lower blood pressure. Eating between one and three eggs every week could lower your risk of hypertension by as much as 21 per cent. But, for the largest benefit, it's best to eat your eggs as part of a healthy, balanced diet. High blood pressure is often known as 'the silent killer"" because patients don't tend to show any symptoms unless they have extremely high blood pressure. Some of the most common high blood pressure symptoms include having a pounding in your chest, finding blood in your urine, and difficulty breathing. Read MoreYou might be interested in... You should speak to a doctor if you're worried about the warning signs of hypertension, or if you think you may be at risk.

Blood sugar monitor has 'changed standard of care' for diabetes patients - but Canada isn't funding it,"For Nadine Pedersen and her teenage son Hudson, who has Type 1 diabetes, getting a glucose-monitoring device was life-changing — and potentially life-saving for him.Now the Vancouver mother, along with many others in B.C. affected by the disease, including doctors, are calling on the province to fund the technology.""The quality of our lives immediately improved,"" Pedersen said. ""It's huge.""The device, called a continuous glucose monitor, is relatively new technology that makes checking blood sugar levels — crucial to managing diabetes — much easier.A tiny sensor is inserted under the skin, usually in the arm or stomach area, and measures blood sugar every few minutes — with no pin-pricking for a droplet of blood needed. Blood sugar levels fluctuate throughout the day, based on things like what was eaten and when.Levels that are either too high or too low come with serious health risks. Should levels fall too low while the person sleeps at night, for example, they might never wake up.'It's forever changed how we manage diabetes'Before 14-year-old Hudson Carpenter got the device, he had to prick his finger a dozen times a day to check his sugar levels.""His fingers just looked like pin cushions,"" Pedersen said. ""And we were getting up at midnight, 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. every night to check his blood sugar levels.""There are different kinds of continuous glucose monitor devices, like the new Dexcom one pictured above that B.C. Diabetes recommends. The technology measures sugar levels with a sensor that's changed roughly every week and gives hundreds of readings per day. (Dexcom )Now, with the tiny sensor under his skin, his glucose levels are measured automatically hundreds of times a day. An alarm goes off it anything happens in the middle of the night. Dr. Tom Elliott, the medical director of B.C. Diabetes, describes the device as a ""revolution.""""It's forever changed how we manage diabetes, it's changed the standard of care,"" Elliott said.""We can no longer go with the old routine. It's not good enough.""No coverage in CanadaAs a doctor, Elliott said, it's easier to treat patients who have the device and prevent diabetes-related complications like kidney disease, heart disease, blindness and amputations.As well as potentially saving lives, the technology also has health-care savings costs down the line, he said — but right now it's not covered anywhere in Canada.That makes footing the bill a struggle for many families using the devices.For Pedersen, a single mother, the ongoing expenses for using the device and related items — things like sensors and transmitters — amounted to $4,000 over the past year. Her insurance company is no longer covering it.But Pedersen says she'll do whatever it takes to keep using the technology.""It's something that we need to keep Hudson safe and survive,"" she said. ""We'll figure out a way to pay for it no matter what we have to do.""CBC has contacted the B.C. Ministry of Health for a response.For Vancouver mother Nadine Pedersen and her teenage son Hudson, who has Type 1 diabetes, getting a glucose monitoring device was life-changing and potentially life-saving. 8:23",https://t.co/r9GPbmACdD,news
"Taking the Sting Out of Fingersticks: Lancets, Life Hacks and More","By Marcia Kadanoff with Katie BowlesTips to reduce the pain and hassle of pricking your finger each time you check your blood sugar levels on a meterWhen I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes two years ago, I struggled quite a bit. I had to change my diet and reconsider my exercise regimen, and I was suddenly made aware of data that had never existed in my world before – A1C and blood sugar numbers swirled around in a confusing mix that I not only had to track, but also keep on target. It seemed impossible.For me, the hardest of these was learning to check my blood sugar. What do the numbers mean? How can I force blood to come out of my fingers when it seems like there isn't any left? I have to do this how many times a day?!These days, I'm incredibly lucky to use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that helps me avoid those painful, frustrating fingersticks (both the Abbott FreeStyle Libre and Dexcom G6 eliminate the need for daily fingersticks). However, plenty of people with diabetes don't have access to a CGM, don't want something on their body, or aren't aware of this technology. This article is for you.Question 1: Does checking your blood sugar have to hurt?After receiving a type 2 diagnosis, I assumed that finger prick pain just had to be a part of my life – I couldn't possibly avoid it if I was regularly checking my blood sugar, right?Wrong.While nothing completely takes away the sting, you can take measures to reduce pain and make it much more bearable. I've found that pricking the sides of my finger pads (instead of the pads themselves) helps greatly. Additionally, not using an alcohol wipe to prep my finger also helped with sensitivity for me. Alcohol dries out and tightens the skin (alcohol is an astringent), making it harder for the lancet to poke through the skin. Of course, you must make sure your hands are washed before a fingerstick; otherwise you could have a false high blood sugar. When I can't wash my hands, at minimum I wipe away the initial (first) drop and place a second drop on the strip.Another hack that many people with diabetes use is to not change your lancet after every fingerstick. Notably, experts have found that this hack – while it can reduce costs – may increase pain because the tip gets blunted, which may increase the risk of infection and therefore is not recommended.Question 2: Am I doing this right?When you're diagnosed, your healthcare provider might show you how to check your blood sugar. However, this isn't guaranteed. I was diagnosed during routine bloodwork and unfortunately wasn't taught how to check my blood sugar during the diagnosis. Even if you're lucky enough to receive this information, there's a pretty good chance that you won't remember everything your doctor tells you. The diagnosis can be overwhelming and filled with information, much of which is overshadowed by the scary thought of ""I have diabetes."" I definitely didn't remember everything when I walked out after being diagnosed.Between myself and my daughter, we could not figure out how to use a coded blood glucose meter (an older type of glucose meter – I recommend avoiding these). I found the process counterintuitive and often used it incorrectly, resulting in multiple painful finger pricks and a lot of frustration. Perhaps I'm unusually bad at figuring out fiddly strips and devices, but I – like many type 2s – got zero education on this topic. It was almost comical how long it took us to learn that I had to bring the strip sideways to the drop of blood on my finger instead of trying to ""dab"" my blood on the top of the strip! I found videos like this one were very helpful (and plentiful):VIDEOI eventually found a simpler meter from One Drop (a nearly identical model is offered through Amazon Choice), which worked better because it was just put in the strip and push a button for the reading (until I got on CGM). This worked particularly well for me because I wasn't using my insurance (due to a high-deductible plan), but I could subscribe without insurance for an affordable monthly cost.And, check out our article on ""How to Get More Strips on a Budget""Question 3: I've successfully checked my blood sugar. Now what?Senior editor Adam Brown is fond of saying, ""Blood sugars are not tests."" Sure, you'll always have a goal in mind – mine is 70-140 mg/dl – but if you ""fail,"" there will be plenty of opportunities to try again. That's where the data from your readings comes in.For example: This morning, I woke up and checked my levels before eating breakfast and received a reading of 140 mg/dl. This isn't high for a lot of people, but (based on my past data and the hard work I've put in since being diagnosed) it is for me – my typical blood sugar ranges from 80 to 100 mg/dl. (I'm only on metformin.) With a reading of 140 mg/dl, I felt I needed to take action.For me, this action is having a low-carb breakfast. To make things easier (particularly before I've had my coffee), I stick to a regular rotation of breakfasts:Nonfat yogurt with a small amount of dark chocolate for flavoring*1 slice of whole wheat sprouted toast with natural/low sugar peanut butter1 slice of whole wheat sprouted toast with avocado1 slice of quiche – without the crust – plus bacon1-2 chicken sausages*2 eggs plus bacon*The breakfasts marked with an asterisk are lower carb, and I know how my body will respond to them after checking my blood sugar again an hour after eating.Thanks to this data, I've also learned that drinking a big glass of water and walking after breakfast will cause my blood sugar to drop. Again, keep in mind that everyone's body is different – what works for me may not work for you, but using your data is the only way to know for sure.As a perfectionist, I also had to learn that there is no ""perfect score"" when it comes to blood sugar. It's not a test. My goal is to keep it within a certain range for as much of the day as possible. For me, that range is 70 to 140 mg/dl (4-8 mmol/l), but for someone else, it could be 80 to 150 mg/dl, and so on. Just like choosing lancets, it's best to listen to your body (this time via the data in your reading).Question 4: I tried to check my blood sugar and couldn't get any blood out of my fingers. What should I do?Even after learning ways to lessen the pain and finding a meter/lancets that worked for me, I still occasionally struggled to get blood out of my fingers in the mornings – my cold hands just wouldn't cooperate. On top of the temperature, I also have diabetic neuropathy in my hands and feet.After many frustrating mornings, I began following the recommended procedure below, and it made a world of difference:Wash your hands in warm water. This removes any food residuals if you're testing post-meal, and the temperature encourages blood flow.Rather than towel-drying, dry your hands by dropping them by your hips, pointing at the floor and flapping them around (think Phoebe's running style on Friends). You'll feel ridiculous, but this method really helps the blood flow. If your hands aren't completely dry at this point, use a towel, as wet hands can result in a falsely low reading.Once your hands are warm and dry, use the lancet on the side of your ""favorite"" finger. This may be mostly mental, but when it's early morning and my hands are cold, using a tried-and-true finger (left little finger, for me) really helps.One additional tip from Virginia Valentine, a certified diabetes educator (CDE) with type 2 diabetes on diaTribe's advisory board:""I have found many patients complaining of pain and then I notice their lancing device is dialed up to ""stun."" I dial it down to 2 or 3 and they are totally skeptical but here is the trick: Press the lancing device really firmly against the side of the finger before you hit the button. When you take the lancing device away from your finger you may think ""nothing happened"" but then when you squeeze from the base of the finger you will get a good size drop of blood.""Question 5: Which lancet/lancing device should I use?Lancets and lancing devices are not one-size-fits-all. And while the abundance of options is great, it can also be overwhelming. To find the right pairing for you, it's best to consider your priorities. Do you want the least amount of pain (smallest needle)? Do you need something large that's easy to grip? Do you want a bigger needle gauge that's more likely to work on the first try? If you have particular issues such as tendonitis, talk to a CDE for recommendations.For me, convenience was a priority, so I chose the Accu-Chek FastClix ­– it's got a drum feature which means I don't have to bring lancets with me when I travel which I always seem to forget. Other popular lancing devices include LifeScan's OneTouch Delica, a smaller device that offers two sizes of lancets, and the FreeStyle Lancing Device, which provides multiple depth settings. Playing around with lancet size and depth can help with pain.Finally, if accuracy is more of an issue than pain, you can try the TrueDraw, a larger device that's easier to hold.Once you've determined your priorities and which devices you want to try (no shame in trying multiple, if you have the means), make sure you're buying the correct equipment. Some lancing devices require their own lancets, while others work with multiple brands – you can find this information on the product website.Additionally, make sure you don't overpay for lancets and lancing devices. Most can be purchased on the product website or in pharmacies, but you can also generally find them on Amazon (often along with helpful reviews). Doing a little research can save a lot of money! Keep an eye out for coupons, and if you have health insurance, always check with your provider to see what (if anything) is covered.Question 6: What about strips?When it comes to strips, more is more – many brands now offer device/supply bundles that include an unlimited supply of strips. One example is the One Drop subscription ($49.95/month, no insurance required), which I used. This monthly subscription includes a meter, unlimited test strips (you can request more at any time) and diabetes coaching, which is very handy for people new to diabetes management.Another similar unlimited strip option is the mySugr bundle ($49/month, no insurance required). This package also includes a meter (the Roche Accu-Chek) and diabetes coaching, and adds access to the mySugr Pro app, which syncs with the meter to provide assistance with nearly every aspect of management.If you aren't looking for an unlimited supply, Amazon also has a line of affordable-ish test strips, coming in at $10.99 for 50 strips ($0.22/strip), $18.50 for 100 strips ($0.19/strip), or $34.05 for 200 strips ($0.17/strip) that are compatible with the Choice Wireless BGM ($23).Both of these packages come with highly rated meters, per the Diabetes Technology Society's recent Blood Glucose Monitor System (BGMS) Surveillance Program. The meter included in the One Drop subscription is the same as the CVS Advanced from Agamatrix, which received a score of 97%, and the Roche Accu-Chek came in at 95%. If you're considering other meters, it's wise to check out the results of this study – an accurate meter makes a world of difference in blood sugar stability.The takeaway from all of this? Blood sugar monitoring will probably never be fun – but it also shouldn't ruin your day, and is an important part of self care for people with diabetes.",https://t.co/bgmBGT6wf4,news
Regular Breakfast With 'Fried Eggs' For Diabetics May Get Benefits Of Low The Blood Sugar Level,"The large blood sugar spike that follows breakfast is due to the combination of pronounced insulin resistance in the morning in people with T2D and because typical Western breakfast foods cereal.People with Type 2 Diabetes (TED) should opt for eggs for breakfast, a recent study suggests. According to the findings, a high-fat, low-carb breakfast (LCBF) can help those with T2D control blood sugar levels throughout the day.""The large blood sugar spike that follows breakfast is due to the combination of pronounced insulin resistance in the morning in people with T2D and because typical Western breakfast foods cereal, oatmeal, toast and fruit — are high in carbohydrates,"" said Jonathan Little, lead author of the study published in the Journal of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.According to Little, breakfast is consistently the ""problem"" meal that leads to the largest blood sugar spikes for people with T2D. The research shows that eating a low-carb and high-fat meal first thing in the morning, is a simple way to prevent this large spike, improve glycemic control throughout the day, and can perhaps also reduce other diabetes complications.Study participants, with well-controlled T2D, completed two experimental feeding days. On one day, they ate an omelette for breakfast and on another day, they ate oatmeal and some fruit. An identical lunch and dinner were provided on both days. A continuous glucose monitor — a small device that attaches to your abdomen and measures glucose every five minutes — was used to measure blood sugar spikes across the entire day. Participants also reported ratings of hunger, fullness and a desire to eat something sweet or savoury.Little's study determined that consuming a very low-carbohydrate high-fat breakfast completely prevented the blood sugar spike after breakfast and this had enough of an effect to lower overall glucose exposure and improve the stability of glucose readings for the next 24 hours.Little does note that there was no difference in blood sugar levels in both groups later in the day, suggesting that the effect for reducing overall post-meal glucose spikes can be attributed to the breakfast responses with no evidence that a low-carb breakfast worsened glucose responses to lunch or dinner.""The results of our study suggest potential benefits of altering macronutrient distribution throughout the day so that carbohydrates are restricted at breakfast with a balanced lunch and dinner rather than consuming an even distribution and moderate amount of carbohydrates throughout the day,"" Little asserted.As another interesting aspect of the research, participants noted that pre-meal hunger and their cravings for sweet foods later in the day tended to be lower if they ate the low-carb breakfast. Little suggests this change in diet may be a healthy step for anybody, even those who are not living with diabetes. #KhabarLive",https://t.co/54mOr4td7O,news
Type 2 diabetes: Eating yoghurt proven to lower blood sugar and prevent the condition,"Type 2 diabetes is a common condition in the UK that can lead to complications involving the nerves, feet, eyes and kidneys. One of the best ways to manage blood sugar levels and to prevent the condition is to eat a healthy diet. Eating a wide range of fruit and vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta are just some of the ways to incorporate health eating into your lifestyle. Experts also recommend keeping sugar, fat and salt to a minimum.But certain foods alone have been found to have blood sugar-lowering properties - for example yoghurt.A Journal of Nutrition analysis of 13 recent studies concluded yoghurt consumption as part of a healthy diet may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in healthy and older adults. And recent research has shown yoghurt consumption may be association with lower levels of glucose. Research published in 2011 also suggested eating probiotic yoghurt could improve cholesterol levels in people with type 2 diabetes.Probiotics are the bacteria that live in the gut which help improve digestion, as well as overall health.Look for yoghurts high in protein and low in carbohydrates, such as unflavoured Greek yoghurt.A probiotic will contain live and active cultures called Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium.When it comes to drinks to lower blood sugar, kale juice has been shown to help. A small-scale study showed kale juice could help regulate blood sugar levels. As part of the findings, participants achieved this result by drinking 300ml of kale juice per day for six weeks.But kale doesn't necessarily have to be enjoyed in juice form.Kale in its natural form can still benefit a person's blood sugar levels.Like all green leafy vegetables, kale is packed full of essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients that have minimal negative impact on blood sugar levels.Alongside diet changes, being active can lower your blood sugar.The NHS recommends you do 2.4 hours of activity a week.""You can be active anywhere so long as what you're doing gets you out of breath,"" to says.Examples of exercise include:Fast walkingClimbing stairsDoing more strenuous housework or gardening",https://t.co/pJ8PcDHUjY,news
Type 2 diabetes: Walnuts proven to lower blood sugar and reduce risk of condition,"Type 2 diabetes is a condition where a person's blood sugar (glucose) level becomes too high. It can trigger symptoms such as excessive thirst, peeing more than usual and feeling very tired. Left untreated, it can lead to long-term complications with the eyes, nerves, kidneys and feet. A healthy diet can help manage blood sugar levels, in particular eating a wide range of foods, including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta, and keeping sugar, fat and salt to a minimum.Certain foods alone have also been found to have blood sugar lowering properties - one being walnuts.The nutty snack is hailed for its healthy fatty acids content and keeping the heart healthy.People with diabetes may have a higher risk of heart disease or stroke, so it's important they get fatty acids, like those found in walnuts, through diet.A study from 2018 suggested eating walnuts is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes. One of the most prominent characteristics of nuts for people with diabetes is their effect on cholesterol levels, according to Diabetes.co.uk.It explains: ""Avoiding high cholesterol levels is essential for people with diabetes, because exposure to high blood glucose levels increases the risk of the arteries narrowing.""Almonds, peanuts, and pistachios all reduce ""bad"" cholesterol very effectively. ""Bad"" cholesterol refers to small, dense particles of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), too much of which can clog the arteries.""Almonds, walnuts, pistachios, pecans, and hazelnuts reduce ""bad"" cholesterol by increasing levels of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL), or 'good' cholesterol. HDL clears out 'bad' cholesterol, thus reducing the risk of heart disease.""Another food which has been found to lower blood sugar is the onion. A study involving 42 people with type 2 diabetes showed eating 3.5 ounces (100g) of fresh red onion reduced fasting blood sugar levels after just four hours. Additionally, a number of animal studies have shown eating onions to benefit blood sugar control.A study demonstrated that diabetic rats fed food containing 5 per cent onion extract for 28 days had decreased fasting blood sugar.Onions anti diabetic effects come from compounds such as quercetin and sulphur.Quercetin has been shown to interact with cells in the small intestine, pancreas, skeletal muscle, fat tissue and liver to control blood sugar regulation.Changes to diet isn't the only way to lower blood sugar.Alongside a healthy diet, keeping active can help manage blood sugar levels.But what types of exercise are most effective?Regular exercise is stated by the government as 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity a week.Diabetes.co.uk explained: ""Aerobic activity at moderate intensity basically means exercising at a level that raises your heart rate and makes you sweat. This includes a multitude of sports.""Here are six examples of aerobic exercise that can people with type 2 diabetes.",https://t.co/VAPzNP7JJP,news
High Altitude Blood Sugars,"Shortly after arriving in Guatemala, we went to a friend's house for lunch and then back to the hotel. One of the things that I hadn't paid much attention to was that I went from sea level to 4,804 feet above sea level. I later found out that altitude could play a part on how your blood sugar reacts to different events, like exercise.During the trip, I had adjusted my insulin according to the fact that I wasn't going to be moving a lot on a five-hour flight. I also remember that the emotional stress of flying would impact my blood sugars as well. Luckily, I had remembered that I would be walking a lot after getting off the plane. After disembarking the plane, I ate a 15g carbohydrate snack to compensate for the walk. Eating a snack worked out very well for me, because if I had changed my insulin, I would've had to wait for my baseline insulin to go down. All in all, it was a good flight, my blood sugar is staying in control, and for me, that meant my blood sugars were in range the whole trip.Unfortunately, day two was not as good. My blood sugar spiraled out of control and with all my expertise I could not figure it out. I asked myself, what factors impact my blood sugar and what factors can cause such resistance?On that day, my activity was much lower than when I am back home in New York City. I relaxed at the hotel, and I got a massage. However, I did exercise for a half hour while making the appropriate adjustments for my typical workout. All in all, I expected to be fighting high blood sugars. That wasn't the case.Could it be the altitude?Truth, I wasn't sure. When I got home from this trip, I searched Google, online, to see how altitude can impact one's blood sugars. I was astonished to find that there is a lot of controversy around this issue. Mainly, articles about weight loss and moving to a higher altitude, overall there is not much difference between individuals who live in a higher or lower altitude. What I did find amongst the conflicting views on this topic is that when you change altitude from lower to higher in the first few weeks, there is an adjustment period. And your body works harder.Various factors can change blood sugar levels in our body. Based on my experience with the higher altitude, it can impact blood glucose levels. My clinical view is the body has to work harder, therefore, burning off more sugar. Lower blood sugars occur when moving to a higher altitude due to less oxygen and increased dehydration.However, unless you're climbing Mount Kilimanjaro this is a rather small factor, but one to keep in mind when exercising at a high-altitude.So what is the mystery factor around my blood sugar going low when I'm doing less work? Everyday life can be very stressful. If someone goes from a stressful state of living to a rather stress-free vacation, his or her cortisol production reduces. Cortisol is a hormone that causes the production of glucose in the human body. As a result of less cortisol, the body has less insulin resistance.Enjoy!Vacations can be challenging for people who live with diabetes. No day is the same. Our patterns of behavior, mood (including stress) and exercise change. Try to predict for complications, do your best to adapt, relax and enjoy your vacation.Eliot LeBow, LCSW, CDE, is a diabetes-focused psychotherapist.

Elevated Blood Sugar levels Linked to Fragility Fractures in Type 1 Diabetes,"There is a higher risk of fragility bone fracture for people with diabetes, and a new study was able to identify a key factor specific to type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients.The study in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism reports that poor glucose control significantly reduces the risk, in T1D patients, of a fall from standing height or less that results in a broken bone.""We investigated the association between the degree of glycemic control and fracture risk by using a large cohort of newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients,"" explained study author Janina Vavanikunnel, MD, of the University Hospital Basel in Basel, Switzerland in an interview with Thailand Medical News. ""Both types of diabetes are associated with fragility fractures and we showed that poor glycemic control is associated with an increased risk of fracture in type 1 diabetes.""Researchers used a primary care database from the United Kingdom for a nested case-control study within a cohort of 3,329 patients with T1D and 44,275 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). What was unusual about the study was that it focused on a 3-year average of hemoglobin A1c values instead of short-term measurements. Participants had an average of nine A1c measurements if they had T1D and 11 if they had T2D.This study found that poor glycemic control—defined as an A1c level above 8%—is associated with an increased risk of fractures in patients with T1D but not T2D, at least in short-term disease. The authors suggest that the risk of fracture in patients with T2D might be because of factors beyond glycemic control, such as comorbidities or medication. ""Nevertheless, fracture risk in type 2 diabetes is of clinical relevance as well as it is a major health concern worldwide due to its high prevalence,"" added coauthor Sarah Charlier, MSc, of University Hospital Basel.The study, which included researchers from Boston University School of Medicine in Lexington, Massachusetts, focused on patients whose T1D or T2D was newly diagnosed between 1995 and 2015. Results indicate that median duration between diabetes onset and fracture date was 4.5 years for both types of diabetes.Researchers report that the risk of fracture was increased in T1D patients with mean HbA1c &gt;8.0% (aOR 1.39, 95% CI, 1.06-1.83) compared with T1D patients having mean HbA1c values less than 7%. While no such effect was detected in T2D patients, their risk of fracture also was elevated, most notably with current use of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.""The impact of glycemic control on the risk of low-trauma fracture differs between T1DM and T2DM patients,"" study authors conclude. ""Poor glycemic control increased the risk of fracture in T1DM but not in T2DM patients.""Reference: Association between glycemic control and risk of fracture in diabetic patients: A nested case-control study, Janina Vavanikunnel, Sarah Charlier, Claudia Becker, Cornelia Schneider, , Christian Meier , The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, jc.2018-01879,https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2018-01879",https://t.co/lNJz3r5KRr,news
Diabetes Management: 5 Desi Diabetes-Friendly Foods That May Help Prevent Blood Sugar Spikes,"HighlightsDiabetes is a common metabolic disorderDiabetics should be very cautious of their dietFibre-rich foods help stabilise blood sugar levelsDiabetes is becoming one of the biggest health scares around the world. The metabolic disorder which used to affect only a select few a while back has now afflicted countless youth and middle-aged men and women too. Diabetes is defined as a condition in which the body's blood sugar levels are abnormally high. The spike in blood sugar occurs either because the body is not producing enough insulin or it is not able to respond well to the insulin produced. It is estimated that by the year 2030, 98 million Indians would be diabetic. Diabetics need to be extra careful of their diet. They should include food that is high on fibre content. Fibre enables slow release of sugar in the bloodstream that prevents abnormal spikes. Diabetics should also steer clear of refined carbohydrates and processed junk; they metabolise fast and cause blood sugar fluctuations.Here are some desi ingredients you are likely to find in any regular Indian kitchen. Eating them may do wonders for your diabetes management. 1. KuttuKuttu or buckwheat is a healthy gluten-free pseudo grain, which is used extensively in vrat preparations. According to the book 'Healing Foods' by DK Publishing House, ""the grain contains slow-release carbohydrates that help maintain steady blood sugar levels. It is abundant in magnesium and manganese, both of which are necessary for carbohydrate metabolism. Kuttu also has a low glycemic index (between 49-51), which makes it an excellent diabetic-friendly food.

No Sugarcoating: The Problems of Type 2 Diabetes,"High blood sugar can have serious health consequences. But it's one health condition you have the power to prevent or possibly reverse. Posted by The Iowa Clinic on Thursday, April 18, 2019 We've long been warned of the dangers of too much sugar. The United States Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines have recommended limiting sugar since 1979 — well before the plate, pyramid or even the food wheel made an appearance.We're not as aware of the dangers of too much blood sugar, a problem that one-third of the American adult population has, most without any knowledge of their condition. But much like the sugar in your diet, the sugar in your blood is completely under your control.High blood sugar means you're at risk for diabetes — or you already have it.Diabetes is a commonly-known condition, of which type 2 diabetes is the most common. More than 90 percent of adults who have high blood sugar have type 2 diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because of the increased levels of sugar in your blood, your cells stop responding normally to insulin. The sugar stays in your blood instead of reaching your cells and converting into energy.Over 11 percent of adults in Iowa have diabetes, a number that trends with the national average. An even greater number — 35.4 percent — have prediabetes, meaning their blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.Prediabetes usually shows no symptoms, hiding the serious condition from a third of Iowans. You usually don't know you have prediabetes until it progresses and you notice the signs of type 2 diabetes:You pee a lot, especially at night.You're always hungry, thirsty and tired.You can lose weight without even trying.You're prone to infections.Sores and bruises don't heal as quickly as they used to.Your skin is dry.Your vision is a little blurry.Your hands and feet are numb and tingly.These symptoms develop slowly, sometimes over years. So your high blood sugar can wreak havoc on your body without you realizing, quietly doubling your risk of heart disease and stroke. It can also put you in danger of nerve, eye or kidney damage, serious infections that require amputation, hearing impairment and Alzheimer's disease.Eating too much sugar is not the cause of high blood sugar.It sounds simple. A diet high in sugar leads to blood high in glucose. There is a connection, but the causes of type 2 diabetes are more complex.Eating a lot of sugar is a sign of a poor diet. And poor nutrition can make you overweight or obese. The additional pounds and continued sugar consumption make it more difficult for your body to regulate your blood sugar and leads to insulin resistance. As a result, your pancreas produces insulin, but the muscle, liver and fat cells can no longer absorb it and convert it to energy properly.In addition to weight and insulin resistance, you have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if:You're over 45.You already have high blood sugar at prediabetes levels.Your mom, dad, brother or sister has type 2 diabetes.You live a sedentary lifestyle, exercising less than three times a week.You had gestational diabetes during pregnancy or your mother had it when you were born.One of your children weighed more than nine pounds at birth.You're African American, Hispanic, Native American or Alaska Native.Your age, genetics and heritage are out of your control. But things you can control, like your eating and exercise habits, are proven to prevent type 2 diabetes.Both prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes are in your hands.So you check a few boxes on the list of risk factors. That doesn't mean you're destined to get type 2 diabetes. It's a highly preventable disease. Even if you're already prediabetic, you can reverse that and return your blood sugar to normal levels.You don't have to take extreme measures to do so. Losing five to seven percent of your body fat can make a big difference. You can shed that excess fat with relatively simple changes to your lifestyle:Eat a balanced diet. Follow the USDA guidelines and eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and whole grains, and low in sugar and fat.Reduce portion sizes. Eat smaller portions of healthy foods to stay at or below the daily recommended amount of calories. Check the USDA calorie needs for your age, sex and physical activity level.Get out and move. A sedentary lifestyle is a big factor in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity five days a week. To lose weight and keep it off, up to 60 minutes a day is recommended.Take your time. Quick diets and intense fitness programs can help you shed pounds. But you risk injury or gaining back weight after the program's end. For sustained success, make gradual changes to your diet and slowly build up your activity and intensity.If you do get a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, the same techniques can help you lose weight and reduce blood glucose levels. Your primary care provider can help you develop a plan to manage your weight and condition. It's possible to manage type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes alone. Your provider may also recommend additional treatments:Blood glucose monitoring – Keeping a watchful eye on your blood sugar is the only way to make sure it is within the target range.Insulin therapy – When type 2 diabetes affects your body's production of insulin, you have to ease the pressure on the pancreas by regularly injecting yourself with insulin and regulate your blood sugar.Medication – Many medications help manage your disease and symptoms. Depending on your condition and other health issues, you may get medicine that lowers glucose production, increase insulin secretion or reduce blood sugar levels.Test your blood sugar to see if you have diabetes or prediabetes.Everyone's risk factors are different. But if you live in Iowa, statistics show you have a 1 in 3 chance of having high blood sugar. If you think you're at risk or you've noticed symptoms of type 2 diabetes, talk to your doctor about testing.The A1C test is used to diagnose type 2 diabetes. It measures how much sugar is covering the hemoglobin in your blood and indicates your average blood sugar level over the last few months.Normal: Less than 5.7%Prediabetes: Between 5.7% and 6.4%Type 2 diabetes: 6.5% or higherWith the results of an A1C test and the recognition of symptoms or confirmation by additional testing, your provider can make a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan that helps you normalize your blood sugar.",https://t.co/gQxXG19Eum,news
Risk Of Gestational Diabetes Determined 7 Years Before Pregnancy,"The risk of gestational diabetes can be determined up to 7 years before pregnancy based on assessing measures of body weight and blood sugar routinely.580 ethnically diversified women participated in the study and women who experienced gestational diabetes while pregnant were compared to those who didn't have gestational diabetes. It was found that the risk of gestational diabetes increased directly with the amount of undesirable risk factors typically connected with heart disease and diabetes that were present before pregnancy, such as hypertension, high blood sugar, and overweight. They also found that undesirable levels of body weight and blood sugar were linked to a 4.6 times increased risk of gestational diabetes, in comparison to women having normal levels.[1]Previous research has revealed that women developing gestational diabetes while pregnant are more inclined to suffer from Type 2 diabetes following pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is characterized by glucose intolerance which usually takes place during the 2nd or 3rd trimester and results in complications in as many as 7% of pregnancies in the US. It can result in early delivery and Cesareans, and increases risk of the baby developing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disease later on in life.The research suggests that cardio-metabolic risk profile for factors regularly evaluated at clinical visits could help physicians in identifying high-risk women for early gestational diabetes management.Even though the established gestational diabetes risk factors are obesity, older maternal age, non-white ethnicity/race, a diabetes family history, and having previously given birth to a really large baby, these risk factors are lacking in as many as 50% of women that experience gestational diabetes. A better knowledge of gestational diabetes pre-pregnancy predictors could help in identifying women at risk and before becoming pregnant, and initiate intervention programs for preventing gestational diabetes and its related risks.",https://t.co/pL4Z8gFjXT,news

Victoza® demonstrated superiority in reducing blood sugar vs placebo in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes,"BALTIMORE, April 28, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Novo Nordisk today announced the results from the ELLIPSE trial which examined efficacy and safety and demonstrated superiority of Victoza® (liraglutide) injection 1.8 mg vs placebo in reducing blood sugar in children and adolescents aged 10-17 with type 2 diabetes.1 ELLIPSE is the first phase 3 trial completed in over a decade in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. These data were presented today at the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES)/Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) Annual Meeting in Baltimore, MD and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.2 Victoza® is currently indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. This study was designed to evaluate the investigational use of Victoza® in children and adolescents.The ELLIPSE trial included a 26-week, double-blinded treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period. The trial results showed that, when added to metformin, with or without concurrent basal insulin treatment, Victoza® significantly reduced A1C at both 26 weeks (primary endpoint) and 52 weeks (secondary endpoint), -0.64% and -0.50% respectively, versus placebo, where there was an increase in A1C at both 26 weeks and 52 weeks, +0.42% and +0.80% respectively (p&lt;0.001 for both).2 Additionally, the proportion of children and adolescents achieving A1C &lt;7% at week 26 (secondary endpoint) was significantly higher in those treated with Victoza® (63.7%) than in those treated with placebo (36.5%), p&lt;0.001.2""The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents is increasing, driven by the global epidemic of childhood obesity, yet our treatment options are limited,"" said Dr. William Tamborlane, professor and Chief of Endocrinology, Yale School of Medicine and ELLIPSE lead investigator. ""These data represent a potential new treatment option for lowering blood sugar in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes."" The results of the ELLIPSE trial have been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for evaluation as a potential treatment option for children 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes. ""We are delighted with the ELLIPSE trial results and look forward to discussions with the FDA and EMA about these data for Victoza®,"" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. ""These data add to the extensive evidence for the use of Victoza® and further cement Novo Nordisk's commitment to addressing a considerable and growing unmet medical need across the full spectrum of the type 2 diabetes patient population.""Overall, the safety profile of Victoza® seen in children and adolescents was similar to that seen in adults. In the trial, the percentage of children who reported an adverse event (AE) was similar in both groups (84.8% with Victoza® vs 80.9% with placebo). Gastrointestinal AEs occurred more frequently with Victoza® (33.3%) than placebo (13.2%).2 Adverse events greater than or equal to 5% in patients treated with Victoza® include headache, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, pyrexia and decreased appetite. Minor hypoglycemia occurred in 24.2% of patients treated with Victoza® vs 10.3% in the placebo arm. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia in patients treated with Victoza®.2About Victoza®Victoza® (liraglutide) injection 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on January 25, 2010, as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. In Europe, approved in 2009, Victoza® is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes together with diet and exercise, as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications and in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes: This diet helps put type 2 diabetes into remission,"Type 2 diabetes is linked to being overweight, in that people who carry excess weight are both more likely to develop the condition and suffer from the associated complications. Complications associated with untreated diabetes include problems with the heart, nerves, kidneys, eyes and feet. Losing excess weight can therefore help to keep the condition under control and in some cases certain diets can help to put it into remission and remove the need for medication. Two women with type 2 diabetes, Claire McKenzie and Vicki Turner, told Express.co.uk how they are no longer in the diabetic range after following a diet by WW - formerly known as Weight Watchers.At her maximum weight, Claire reached a peak of 23 stone, following which she discovered she had type 2 diabetes during a routine test.After receiving her diagnosis, Claire joined WW in a bid to lose weight and adopt a healthier eating regime.Six months after starting the WW programme, Claire was no longer considered to be in the diabetic range. Over a year after starting WW, she has lost five stone so far and intends to lose more.""At first I felt crushed by the [diabetes] diagnosis and was so worried about how it would impact my life,"" said Claire.""I immediately joined WW and have been going ever since. Within six months of joining I'd completely reversed my diabetes, my blood pressure had come down to normal, and my cholesterol was no longer high.""I do take some medication but the diabetic nurse assured me the biggest difference has been my weight loss and my healthy diet.""I have had further tests and over a year on from reversing the diabetes, the retinal damage it caused has corrected itself.""Vicki, meanwhile, weighed 17 stone and suffered from severe abdominal pain before deciding to start WW.After starting the programme, Vicki lost three stone in six months, following which she has lost a further four stone. She is no longer considered to be diabetic.""In 2017, I was told at one of my diabetes checks that my blood pressure and cholesterol levels were normal [and] I was no longer diabetic,"" said Vicki.""Having been diabetic, I would always remain high risk, but it feels amazing to have conquered my unhealthy lifestyle.""WW is an official provider of the Healthier You NHS England Diabetes Prevention Programme.According to WW, in one recent programme 166 patients were referred to WW from 14 GP practices across Bromley.Following the 48-week programme, almost 70 per cent of the patients either reduced their risk or were no longer at risk of type 2 diabetes.How does the WW programme work?""With the WW plan, no foods are off limits, even when you have diabetes. There are no 'diabetes recipes' or special foods,"" explains WW.""Instead, the WW SmartPoints® system guides you to foods that are lower in sugar and higher in protein.The WW plan also helps patients to complete and keep track of physical activity to aid their weight loss.Patients can earn 'FitPoints®' for the physical activity they do and will learn exactly how each activity benefits their own body, based on their height, weight, age and sex.All patients on the WW programme receive guidance from a personal wellness coach.",https://t.co/2HCz5brub4,news
Aberdeen scientist's drink invention 'could prevent diabetes',"An Aberdeen scientist has invented a health drink which could be used to prevent people from developing diabetes.After years of study, Dr Madalina Neacsu has devised a way to harness the power of buckwheat to help people control their blood sugar levels.Certain molecules within the gluten-free crop have already been shown to do this by speeding up the breakdown of glucose in the body.And these have now been brought together for the first time by Dr Neacsu in the form of a buckwheat beverage.It is thought it could help people who are managing the symptoms of type 2 diabetes by reducing the effects of their blood sugar spikes.And it could also prove to be a vital way of preventing those at risk of developing the condition from ever doing so, by balancing their blood sugar levels before the condition progresses.As part of her work at the Rowett Institute, Dr Neacsu is launching a clinical trial to find people willing to try the drink and test her theory.She said: ""Buckwheat grows in quite cold climates like Latvia and Poland, where wheat isn't really grown. A lot of people there have it in their diets.""It has molecules which show potential for sugar metabolism.""We want to see if we can design foods rich in buckwheat and then use these to reduce or prevent the effects of manageable diabetes.""Dr Neacsu is hoping to find volunteers who will eat a meal and have a sugary drink, then have their blood glucose levels tested.She will then repeat the experiment by giving them the buckwheat beverage alongside the food and seeing if there is a difference.If the trial is successful, it could lead to doctors prescribing diabetes patients with buckwheat-rich diets to manage their symptoms.She added: ""We'll be giving people the same amount of sugar each time to see if it is the buckwheat in the drink which is important.""Both male and female participants are needed for the survey.Those interested must be 18 or older, healthy and have type 2 diabetes being controlled by either diet and lifestyle, or through metformin.For more information, email Dr Neacsu at m.neacsu@abdn.ac.uk.",https://t.co/orKlbrnfC1,news
"Breakfast Removes Cholesterol, Blood Sugar and Weight","The breakfast is the most important meal in the day, and should never be skipped.There are many people who believe that they support their health by omitting breakfast, and according to the Association of UK Dieticians (BDA), only two-thirds of adults in the UK eat breakfast regularly, and around three-quarters of Americans.Some maintain that the importance of this first meal in the day is wisely included in its name: we're advised to eat it to break our overnight fast.According to dietician Sarah Elder, the body uses a lot of energy stores for growth and repair through the night, so a balanced breakfast helps to boost the energy levels, as well as the amounts of protein and calcium used throughout the night.It energizes the body, improves concentration, and helps the body to burn calories. Studies have shown that breakfast is linked to improved memory, and a lower risk of heart disease, obesity, disease, and high cholesterol. When we skip breakfast, we experience increased cravings as the sugar levels in the body are low, and we end up overeating during the rest of the day. The following breakfast recipe is a healthy option to start the day. It will support the calorie-burning process, lower cholesterol and glucose levels, and help you lose excess weight. Its main ingredients are oats and chia seeds. Chia seeds are abundant in omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, and the powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties improve heart health and fight arthritis, and diverticulosis. An ounce of chia seeds contains 27 % phosphorus, 18 % calcium, 30 % manganese, as well as smaller levels of copper and potassium.On the other hand, oatmeal is a rich source of beta-glucan, a soluble fiber that lowers bad cholesterol. Oats are also high in manganese, selenium, zinc, magnesium, iron, thiamin, phosphorus, etc. A cup of cooked oatmeal contains 150 calories, 4 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein. Here is how to prepare your delicious breakfast:Ingredients: 1 cup of oats4 tablespoons of chia seeds2 cups of water2 tablespoons of honey1 teaspoon of cinnamonA bit of saltInstructions:Pour the water in a pot, add cinnamon, and as soon as the water starts boiling lower the heat and add the oats. Boil for 5 minutes, and remove the pot from heat. Cover it, and leave it aside for 5 minutes. Stir, add chia seeds, honey, and salt, and enjoy!",https://t.co/o2ppfjwNqY,news
"Acid, Tripping & Blood Sugar Levels","Individuals with diabetes may struggle with various symptoms caused by high or low blood sugar. High blood sugars tend to cause depressive feelings and mood swings, while low blood sugar may cause scattered thoughts while extreme lows can even cause hallucinations and delusional thinking.TrippingIt was November of 1989, my freshman year of college; I had just passed the clock in the center of campus when I felt weak. As my legs gave out, I tripped and fell. My blood sugar had dropped to 17mg/dL, and I didn't have any glucose on me. Luckily, I had gotten some strength up and stumbled my way to the campus restaurant where I downed a glass of juice and recovered.There wasn't as much information back then as there is today, but I realized the hard way that having a role of Lifesavers in my pocket at all time was important. Without them, I may have ended up having a diabetes seizure.While working as a Diabetes-Focused Psychotherapist, I have listened to multiple stories involving delusions and hallucinations during extreme low blood sugar reactions. I have also experienced that state mind during my last low blood sugar that landed me in the hospital.It was 1994 and my last year of undergrad, and I had just turned 21 years old. I was studying for an exam one afternoon in late October, and it was 3 pm. The sun was glaring as it entered my bedroom. I remember looking at the clock. The clock read 11:00 pm and as I believed it was time for bed I went downstairs to the bathroom and brushed my teeth.In reality, I froze at the bottom of the steps, and I spent five minutes staring at my roommate. Then I turned around, went back upstairs to my room and went to bed.At 4 pm, I awoke to demons in my room. They strapped me to a board of wood, carried me downstairs and out the front door. After they take me outside, I notice my roommate waving goodbye as I'm being put into a hearse. Just as I thought I was dead, I awoke in a cold hospital room, connected to a glucose IV.These examples show how low blood sugars can impact us physically and change our perceptions of the world around us. High blood sugars can also affect us physically, psychologically and emotionally.High Blood SugarsFor individuals with type I diabetes and some who have type 2, high blood sugar put them at physical risk due to ketones. As high blood sugar levels continue to increase above 250, the liver can start failing, causing ketones to seep into the bloodstream.Ketones are a mild form of acid released from fats, to prevent starvation. When they release into the bloodstream, they build up til you become so saturated with acid that ketoacidosis occurs. Ketoacidosis is a toxic physical state that has a high mortality rate in people with type I diabetes, and some who have type 2.High blood sugar levels in the bloodstream negatively impact the cognitive functioning of the brain. The higher one's blood sugar goes, the more the brain's ability to process information decreases. If blood sugar stays high for extended periods, then many issues occur, from destabilizing emotions as notes by symptoms of depression to poor judgment and decision-making. Everybody experiences different symptoms, but the outcome is usually the same making the relationship with oneself and others more difficult.So What Now?If you are having multiple reactions a day due to overly tight management, then set your target range higher. Getting an A1c of 7 is better in the long-run than the impact of many daily low blood sugars. Everyone's issues are unique. If you are struggling to manage your blood sugar levels, scheduling a session with a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) may help. Fear of low blood sugars may cause some people to keep their blood sugars high, in this case seeing a psychotherapist who specializes in phobias or diabetes could help.Working toward better blood glucose management always helps.If you are unsure of what is wrong, whether it's having trouble getting blood glucose under control, depression or anxiety, scheduling a session with a psychotherapist who focuses on diabetes care can help. As a practitioner who specializes in diabetes psychotherapy, I take a holistic approach addressing all areas, including how the condition impacts you physically, psychologically, and emotionally. I work clients to target various aspects of their lives with the goal of helping them to thrive and better manage life with diabetes.Eliot LeBow, LCSW, CDE, is a diabetes-focused psychotherapist. His private practice, located in New York City and is also available via Skype. LeBow, who has been living with type 1 diabetes since 1977, treats the many diverse cognitive, behavioral, and emotional needs of people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.For more information go to his website or Facebook Page or set up a free 30-minute phone consultation to see if talk therapy is right for you.Medical Disclaimer:All the advice included in this blog is therapeutic in nature and should not be considered medical advice.

Foods for Diabetic Meal Plan to Control Blood Sugar Level,"Diabetic meal plan By M MilaTreatment of diabetes is nothing just to control blood sugar level. Selection of foods is the most considerable issue as persons with diabetes should avoid foods, which spike sugar level, like those with high carbohydrate, starchy foods, and foods with Hyperglycemia of higher GI(Glycemic Index) index. Considering these factors this article makes an endeavor to highlight essential ingredients of some food items which can be included in the diabetic meal plan for a person with the diabetic or pre-diabetic condition. An appropriate portion of these foods not only contribute to managing your blood sugar level but also keeps you healthy and active.One basic condition of good foods for diabetes is that the food must be rich in chromium. As chromium encourages your body cells to absorb sugar from the blood, it plays a key role to control blood sugar level[i]. Chromium is provided in many fruits that are said as the diabetes-friendly fruits and also vegetables, which are called as the good vegetables for diabetes. In addition to chromium, your diabetic meal plan must also include a healthy diet that provides you required heat and energy to your body with the controlled amount of carbohydrate.The diabetes meal plan to control blood sugarDiabetic meal planKeeping this in view, under-mentioned grain products, potatoes, legumes and nuts, seafood, meats, and dairy products have been recommended for your diabetic meal plan in addition to those diabetic friendly fruits and vegetables. If you are aware of the daily intake of these foods, there is no reason for you to worry about the control of blood sugar level as well as other diseases associated with diabetes.BarleyThe unique profile of nutrients in barley makes it a strong defender against diabetes. It fights against diabetes in three ways. First, barley has a low GI, which is 25, compared to 58 for oatmeal, 55 for brown rice and 45 for pasta[ii]. It means its ability to raise blood glucose level is far below than the other 3 meals. Secondly, barley is high in soluble fiber, which slows down emptying your stomach preventing carbohydrate to be absorbed too fast and raising blood sugar level. The third is the presence of rich magnesium content in barley. Magnesium helps production and secretion of insulin and let the body use glucose for its cells. Thus, barley as a grain product should be kept at the top of the list of your diabetic meal plan. Barley Oatmeal or breakfast cerealOats may have higher carbohydrate, but its fiber content slows down the release of sugar into the bloodstream. Studies have found oats may be helpful in lowering blood sugar level and improving blood sugar control[iii]. Usually, people eat oats in the form of porridge as a popular breakfast. But you can make more effective healthy food for diabetes as well as for weight loss diet using oats. Here are some different oats recipes which you can include in your diabetic meal plan[iv]. Oatmeal Sweet PotatoAccording to American Diabetic Association (ADA), sweet potatoes are called as the superfood for diabetes[v]. Sweet potatoes contain carbohydrate, but if you eat the right size, unlike other starchy vegetables it would not spike your blood sugar level due to its insulin sensitivity boosting. Some research shows that sweet potatoes contain adiponectin, a type of hormone which is released from fat cells. Adiponectin regulates insulin and improves metabolism. Thus sweet potatoes should be a good choice for your diabetic meal plan not only to give you a healthy diet but also to control your blood sugar level. Sweet potato Beans, Chickpeas, Lentils and other LegumesAlmost all types of beans (including black, white, lima, pinto, soy, and kidney), lentils, chickpeas, Bengal gram, and other common legumes contain high-quality carbohydrate, lean protein, and soluble fiber. These beans type of foods reduce hunger with a small quantity and the soluble fiber forms into a gel in your gut that helps to control blood sugar level. According to a research result published in the ADA journal, patients who took beans and legumes for 3 months showed significant control of their blood sugar level than those consumed whole wheat products[vi]. Beans and Legumes NutsA research of Louisiana State University found most of the tree nuts including almonds, pistachios, walnuts, cashew, hazelnut and pecans lower risk of Type-2 diabetes[vii]. Nuts are very filling and loaded with fiber, protein and high levels of unsaturated fats which contribute to good cholesterol (HDL). Whether raw or roasted, nuts are highly beneficial to your health. For example, a serving of one-ounce almonds contains 6.1 grams of carbohydrate, which includes 3.5 grams of fiber. As fiber does not produce sugar, balance 2.6 grams of carbohydrate only are available to raise your bold sugar level. A few nuts may be taken at any time to break your hunger, even though that is not in your diabetic meal plan.Peanuts are though legume but not of the category of tree nut, they have also very low GI and 26-28% protein. It contains essential vitamins, minerals are called as nature's powerhouse that is more than eggs and dairy. Peanuts are also a good source of poly and monounsaturated fat that contributes to human heart health. Nuts YogurtYogurt as fermented food contains good bacteria, which is known as probiotics. Its main function is to improve gut health that helps reducing obesity and diabetes. Low-fat yogurt contains high-quality carbohydrate and protein making it a healthy food for diabetes. Some research found consumption of yogurt controls your blood sugar level and checks insulin resistance[viii]. Another study has found the potential link of regular yogurt consumption reduces the risk of Type-2 diabetes[ix]. Yogurt EggsEggs are versatile foods with a rich source of protein and minerals. Though eggs are filled with cholesterol, one large egg contain only half gram of carbohydrate. Thus the ADA has recommended eggs as an excellent choice of food for people with diabetes[x]. If you have diabetes, you can eat a hard-boiled egg as a high protein snack. The protein meets-up hunger without affecting your blood sugar level. Protein also helps to slow down glucose absorption. Being readily available and easy to cook, eggs in the breakfast may be included in your everyday diabetic meal plan. Egg Sea Fish or Fatty FishFish is a great source of protein and essential minerals. Especially those fatty fish or sea water fish contain Omega-3 fatty acid that may help in a decrease of insulin resistance of diabetic personnel[xi]. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and fish oil protect people from coronary heart diseases. Studies have shown that people who eat fish at least once in a week have a lower mortality rate from coronary disease than those who do not. As diabetic people tend to be caught by heart-related disease, sea fish or fatty fish should be a part of a diabetic meal plan at least once or twice in a week. Sea fish ChickenChicken is the most popular poultry meat in today's context. Although chicken contains both carbohydrate and fat, yet a portion of chicken with right kind of cooking may be allowed to a diabetic person regularly. A diabetic person may be allowed 45-75 grams of carbohydrate per meal depending on individual goal[xii]. A white chicken breast carries more carbohydrate than this limit. Fried chicken especially fast food variety is not good for people with diabetes. Here are different varieties of chicken recipes, cooked with Indian masala (cinnamon, cardamom, onion, ginger, chili, and turmeric powder etc) and baked or grilled chicken that is recommended for your diabetic meal plan. Chicken CheeseMany people think cheese, as a high-calorie food should not be included in the diabetic meal plan. But, it should be remembered that if you are diabetic your body does not properly metabolize carbohydrate, instead, your body gets high blood sugar. So, your diabetic meal plan must include a healthy diet with the controlled amount of carbohydrate managing your blood sugar, which cheese can perform. An ounce of mozzarella or cheddar cheese each contains less than 1 gram carbohydrate[xiii]. An appropriate quantity of cheese can be kept in your breakfast, lunch or dinner through careful planning. Cheese Final wordsDiabetes matters differently to very individual due to a different state of insulin resistance. Some of the food may fit someone's health, which may affect adversely to some other. You need to observe how your body metabolizes with foods having carbohydrate, starch, fat, and sugar. Therefore, your diabetic meal plan should include those foods with their appropriate portion depending upon readings of your blood sugar control.",https://t.co/rBvg3ZTqq4,news

Keto can have numerous benefits. As a treatment, it's often used for epilepsy seizures, it can offset the metabolic syndrome, may improve or stops sleep apnea. It can have positive effects on wide variety of systems of the body. I.e. the brain, the gut, the joints and much more. The Ketogenic Diet differs from the Atkins or the Carnivore Diet because it allows a little bit more carbs – preferably in the form of complex carbohydrates. The Ketogenic Diet can be successfully coupled with fasting as well (intermittent, water or dry). Just like with any lifestyle change, it's recommended to be supervised by a physician and have regular blood work done while doing Keto!

To Optimize Your Blood Sugar Level,"Insulin is essential to staying alive; unfortunately, the vast majority of people have resistance to this essential hormone, speeding up the aging process and contributing to the development of degenerative diseases. Any meal high in grain and sugar carbs typically generates a rapid rise in blood glucose.To compensate, your pancreas secretes more insulin into your bloodstream to lower your blood sugar. Insulin, however, is also very efficient at lowering blood sugar by turning it into fat. The more you secrete, the more fat your body will accumulate.If you consistently consume a high-sugar, high-grain diet, your blood glucose level will be correspondingly high and over time your body becomes desensitized to insulin, requiring more and more of it to get the job done. Eventually, you become insulin resistant and prone to weight gain, and then full-blown diabetic.Prediabetes1 is defined as an elevation in fasting blood glucose between 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and 125 mg/dl. At 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, it formally becomes Type 2 diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 84.1 million American adults — about 1 in 3 — are prediabetic,2,3 and most are unaware of this fact.However, any fasting blood sugar regularly over 90 in my book suggests insulin resistance, and findings by the late Dr. Joseph Kraft — former chairman of the department of clinical pathology and nuclear medicine at Presence Saint Joseph's Hospital, Chicago, and author of ""Diabetes Epidemic and You: Should Everyone Be Tested?"" — suggests a whopping 80% of Americans are insulin resistant, and that's true even if your fasting glucose is normal.4,5The good news is that insulin resistance is one of the easiest health problems to correct. Below I review eight of my top tips for optimizing and maintaining a healthy blood sugar level.Tip No. 1 — Proper Meal TimingIntermittent fasting or compression of your eating window is a powerful approach that facilitates weight loss and helps reduce your risk of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes.In his book ""Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy and Sleep Well Every Night,"" Satchidananda Panda, Ph.D., cites research showing that 90 percent of people eat across a span of 12 hours a day, and many across even longer timespans, which is a clear prescription for metabolic disaster.Intermittent fasting, i.e., the cycling of feast (feeding) and famine (fasting) mimics the eating habits of our ancestors and restores your body to a more natural state that allows a whole host of metabolic benefits to occur.6With regard to insulin resistance, research shows intermittent fasting promotes insulin sensitivity and improves blood sugar management by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates.7While there are a number of different intermittent fasting protocols, my preference is fasting daily for 18 hours and eating all meals within a six-hour window. If you're new to the concept of intermittent fasting, consider starting by skipping breakfast and have your lunch and dinner within a six-hour timeframe, say 11 AM and 5 PM, making sure you stop eating three hours before going to bed.The latter is important, as it helps protect your mitochondrial function. Recent research8,9 shows men who are at risk of Type 2 diabetes can improve their glucose control, thereby lowering that risk, simply by eating all their meals within a nine-hour timeframe — even if they do not implement any other dietary changes.Research10,11 has also shown men who eat supper at least two hours before bedtime have a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer, and women have a 16% lower risk of breast cancer than those who eat dinner closer to bedtime. For more details on why late-night eating is so detrimental, see ""Eating Early Dinner Aids Weight Loss and Lowers Cancer Risk.""When you do eat, focus on healthy protein in moderate amounts and minimize net carbs like pasta and bread, exchanging them for healthy fats like butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and raw nuts. This will help shift you into fat burning mode.On a related side note, when eating, relax and take your time! Research shows rushed eating, which typically occurs when you're stressed, has a significant impact on your blood sugar level. When you become stressed your body also secretes cortisol and glucagon, both of which affect your blood sugar levels as well.12 You can learn more about this in ""How Stress Can Affect Your Blood Sugar Level.""Tip No. 2 — Monitor Your Blood Sugar LevelAs mentioned, while prediabetes13 is clinically defined as having a fasting blood sugar level between 100 and 125 mg/dl, I strongly believe any blood sugar over 90 mg/dl puts you in the danger zone for insulin resistance. Your blood sugar is measured through a glucose test, of which there are four types:Fasting plasma glucose test — When you fast overnight and take your blood sample in the morningOral glucose tolerance test — Similar to the fasting blood sugar test, overnight fasting is required for this, and the person's fasting blood sugar level is measured. Afterward, a sugary liquid is provided and the levels are then tested for the next two hoursHemoglobin A1C test — This test checks the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin and will indicate your average blood sugar level for the past two to three monthsRandom plasma glucose test — This makes use of a blood sample that is taken at a random timeYou could also do 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring, which I've done in the past, although it's pricey and probably not necessary for most people.At the time, I used a Dexcom monitor, which involves inserting a sensor beneath your skin for a week, which takes continuous glucose readings every few minutes. It really helped me fine-tune and evaluate how different foods impacted my glucose levels, and helped me understand the importance of feast-famine cycling.All of that said, for most people, a simple at-home glucose test,14 where you prick your finger and deposit a drop of blood onto a glucose testing strip, will do the job. Ideally, test yourself two to three times a day: first thing in the morning, before your first meal, and a couple of hours after your last meal.Your blood glucose levels will vary throughout the day. According to conventional recommendations, if you are healthy and do not have diabetes, your fasting blood glucose upon waking should be below 100 mg/dL. I recommend aiming for a fasting (when you wake up) level below 90 mg/dL.Before meal time, your glucose level should read between 70 to 99 mg/dL. After meals — or what's called ""postprandial"" and is usually taken two hours after eating — the level should be below 140 mg/dL.There are two measurements used for blood sugar levels. In the U.S., the measurement is in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). In the U.K. and Canada, the measurement for blood sugar is in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). To convert to mg/dL, multiply the amount by 18. For example, if a person in the U.K. says that their blood glucose result is 7 mmol/L, in the U.S. it's read as 126 mg/dL.Tip No. 3 — Monitor Your Blood KetonesAnother valuable test is the blood ketone test, which will tell you whether you're in nutritional ketosis or not. I recommend starting your intermittent fasting routine and monitoring your blood ketones as you go along. The KetoCoachX monitor15 is currently one of the best and least expensive ketone monitors on the market.You're in nutritional ketosis once your blood ketone level is above 0.3 to 0.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).16 Ideally, perform the test first thing in the morning while still in a fasted state (i.e., before ingesting anything). Having a fasting ketone level above 1 mmol/L is a sign you're in deep ketosis.Once your fasting ketones are greater than 0.3 mmol/L, then you can start incorporating partial fasting as described in my book, ""KetoFast: Rejuvenate Your Health With a Step-by-Step Guide to Timing Your Ketogenic Meals.""The partial fasting regimen described in ""KetoFast"" essentially mimics ancestral eating patterns, allowing your body to work optimally by allowing for periods of breakdown and cleanout, and periods of rebuilding and rejuvenation.Among the many health benefits of cyclical fasting is improved circulating glucose and lipid levels.17For a summary of my KetoFast protocol, see ""Avoid the Dark Side of Fasting and Ketosis With KetoFasting.""Tip No. 4 — Radically Limit Net Carbs Until You Are Metabolically FlexibleAlong with intermittent fasting, you'll also want to adopt a cyclical ketogenic diet, which involves radically limiting carbs (replacing them with healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein) until you're close to or at your ideal weight. As with intermittent fasting, this will allow your body to start using fat as its primary fuel rather than carbohydrates.Twenty grams of carbs a day is on the low end of what's typically recommended to maintain nutritional ketosis, although some may be able to eat up to 50 grams a day and still maintain a ketogenic state.The only way you'll know how many total carbs, fiber and net carbs you eat is to keep a food diary. The simplest way of doing this is to use an online nutrition tracker. Also remember you need to measure your ketones to determine if and when you're in nutritional ketosis.One of the primary reasons you develop insulin resistance is because you're eating too many net carbs (total carbs minus fiber), too much protein and too little healthy fat. For optimal health, your body must be able to burn fat for fuel, and this is an ability that is lost when you consume too many net carbs on a daily basis.When your body is able to burn fat for fuel, your liver creates ketones (water-soluble fats) that not only improve your glucose metabolism18 but also burn far more efficiently than carbs, thus lowering inflammation by creating fewer damaging reactive oxygen species and secondary free radicals.If your ketones are above 0.3 mmol/L, as described in the section above, you can start increasing the amount of healthy carbs back into your diet and start cyclical ketosis.To get you started, see my previous article, ""Ketogenic Diet: A Beginner's Ultimate Guide to Keto."" A far more detailed exposition on nutritional ketosis and how to implement a cyclical ketogenic diet can be found in my book, ""Fat for Fuel,"" which is the prequel to ""KetoFast.""Tip No. 5 — Increase Healthy FatsA key to making nutritional ketosis work is to replace the lost carbs with healthy fats, and knowing which fats are healthy and which ones are not is a crucial distinction here. Most people will need 60 to 85 percent of daily calories in the form of fat, but not all fats qualify.Fats to steer clear of are industrially processed vegetable oils, found in most processed foods and restaurant foods. Polyunsaturated fat found in processed vegetable oils is not harmful in and of itself, but becomes so if and when you eat too much of it, and/or when the oils degrade, which occurs during refining, processing and heating (cooking).Not only can they form trans fats if heated high enough, but they can also form cyclic aldehydes, which are even more harmful. For a run-down of the dangers associated with processed vegetable oils, see ""Top 13 Reasons to Replace Dangerous Oils With Healthy Fats.""For cooking, healthy alternatives include coconut oil, grass fed raw organic butter, organic ghee, lard, tallow and olive oil. For general eating, foods high in healthy fats include avocado, olives, coconut, raw nuts such as macadamia and pecans, seeds such as black sesame, cumin, pumpkin and hemp seeds, raw cacao butter and organic pastured egg yolks.Dairy fats found in butter, cheese and yogurt have been shown to lower your diabetes risk specifically. MCT oil is another healthy fat — just be sure to avoid taking it during partial fasting days once you've started KetoFasting, as exogenous ketones will inhibit autophagy.Tip No. 6 — Drink Plenty of Clean Pure WaterNext, be sure to drink plenty of clean, purified water. Organic black coffee (meaning no milk or sugar) and tea are other healthy choices. Steer clear of all sweetened beverages, including ""diet"" drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners and fruit juices.As for how much water you need, your best bet is to use thirst and the color of your urine as a guide, along with frequency of urination.Thirst — Simply using thirst as a guide to how much water you need to drink is a simple way to help ensure your individual needs are met, day by dayColor — If your urine is a deep, dark yellow, then you are likely not drinking enough water. Light straw-colored urine is typically a sign of sufficient water intakeFrequency of urination — If your urine is scant or if you haven't urinated in many hours, that too is an indication that you're not drinking enough. Based on the results from a few different studies, a healthy person urinates on average about seven or eight times a dayTip No. 7 — Eat More Nuts and SeedsIn addition to being a good source of healthy fats, nuts and seeds are also an excellent source of magnesium, which many are deficient in. Lack of magnesium may raise your risk of insulin resistance as it plays an important role in carbohydrate and glucose metabolism. Magnesium helps your body metabolize carbs and glucose properly. As noted by Today's Dietician:19""Epidemiologic data20,21 suggest that for every 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreases by approximately 15%. The few clinical studies22,23 showing efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity with magnesium supplementation have used doses between 300 and 365 mg/day.""Some of the most magnesium-rich seeds include sunflower, black sesame, black cumin, pumpkin and chia seeds. Among these, black cumin (nigella sativa) deserves special mention, as studies have shown it can help prevent both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.In one study, black cumin improved glucose tolerance as efficiently as metformin.24 As a source of healthy fats, my preferences go to macadamias, pecans and walnuts, as they are high in fat while being lower in protein.Tip No. 8 — Properly Prescribed ExerciseLast but not least, you need exercise, focusing more on strength/resistance training than cardio. Research25 published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise found even a single session of moderate exercise can improve the way your body regulates glucose and reduces postprandial glucose spikes, and several studies have demonstrated the benefits of strength training for diabetes specifically.Among them is a 2017 study,26 which found strength training lowered women's risk of Type 2 diabetes by 30%. Adding aerobic exercise on top of it reduced the risk even further. Participants who performed at least 120 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, along with some form of strength training, had a 65% lower risk for Type 2 diabetes than those who did neither.Research27 published in April 2019 found a link between muscular strength and Type 2 diabetes incidence. People with mid-level muscular strength, measured using leg and bench press tests, had a 32% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to weaker cohorts, irrespective of cardiorespiratory fitness. No significant association between diabetes and upper level muscle strength was observed, however.A third example of this kind of research was published in BioMed Research International in 2013.28This review also investigated the mechanisms of how exercise lowers your risk of diabetes. One way by which strength training improves your glucose metabolism is by increasing glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle.GLUT4 translocation occurs as a result of muscle contraction,29 and is required for proper regulation of glucose uptake in your muscles. Strength training increases your insulin sensitivity, as lean muscle is highly sensitive to insulin,30 which helps restore metabolic flexibility.By using insulin more efficiently, your body also ends up using more glucose, leaving less to circulate in your bloodstream — hence the improvements in glucose control.31,32 ""Increased energy expenditure and excess postexercise oxygen consumption in response to resistance training may be other beneficial effects,"" the review paper33 notes.High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has also been shown to effectively reduce your risk for diabetes. In one such study,34 older overweight Type 2 diabetics improved their glucose regulation in just six HIIT sessions done over the course of two weeks.Participants performed 10 bouts of 60-second cycling at 90 percent of their maximum heart rate, interspersed with 60 seconds of rest (total time spent exercising was one hour per week). Overall, the average 24-hour blood glucose concentration was reduced from 7.6 mmol/L (± 1.0) to 6.6 mmol/L (± 0.7) following the exercise.According to the authors, ""Our findings indicate that low-volume HIIT can rapidly improve glucose control and induce adaptations in skeletal muscle that are linked to improved metabolic health in patients with Type 2 diabetes.""Sources and ReferencesThe post To Optimize Your Blood Sugar Level appeared first on LewRockwell.",https://t.co/qmxuMhvpQ6,news
How to Eat for Blood Sugar Health,"It's essential to understand blood sugar health and how to eat in an optimal way to support healthy insulin function. This will help you more easily burn fat for fuel, keep weight off, and support overall health throughout your life.Blood Sugar 101 When you eat any food, even fat, your insulin level will rise. Higher amounts of refined carbohydrates or simple sugars will raise your insulin faster and in higher amounts. The greater the fiber content of your diet, the slower insulin is raised and the more controlled the process. When you eat a large meal, regardless of the type of calories, it causes a large surge in insulin that is difficult to manage. Insulin is a taxicab for calories. Its goal is to take blood sugar, as its passenger, to various locations in your body that want it. It helps if you are active, as some of the sugar is more likely to be wanted by cells in your body, including your many muscle cells. Blood sugar is fuel, like gasoline is to a car. Your brain must have a regular supply or your head conks out. Thus, following a meal your insulin taxis are busy transporting sugar through your circulation and out to your cells, hoping to find cells that need some sugar. In a healthy person, insulin drops off a whopping 60 percent of the sugar at your liver, which acts as a warehouse, converting the blood sugar to glycogen for storage. Insulin is released by your pancreas in two phases. The first phase is from insulin that is already made and stored in your pancreas, which is just waiting for some food to come along. This is your first wave of taxis coming to pick up the first set of blood sugar passengers. The release of this insulin triggers your pancreas' beta cells to start making more insulin to deal with the rest of the meal. As you are eating, some of the insulin transports blood sugar to your white adipose tissue or stored fat. The blood sugar is taken up by fat cells, activating their metabolism, in turn producing the hormone leptin. Leptin now enters your blood and begins traveling up to your brain. The more you eat, the more insulin you make, and the more leptin you make. When leptin levels get high enough, meaning you have eaten enough, then leptin permeates into your brain and tells your subconscious brain you are full. At the same time, the higher levels of leptin also tell your pancreas that you are full, which turns off the beta cell production of insulin, as no more taxis are needed. If you ate the right amount of food for your physical activity level, then blood sugar always has some place healthy to go; insulin rises and falls in a controlled manner, as does leptin. When insulin has too many blood sugar passengers, and cells don't need any sugar, then insulin stimulates the production of triglycerides, which can become stored fat. This is how you gain weight. Unfortunately, as triglycerides elevate in your blood, they interfere with leptin getting into your brain. This keeps you eating more than you need to because you don't yet have a full signal, a problem called leptin resistance. This encourages even further insulin driven triglyceride formation, making it morelikely you will gain weight. If you stop eating too much and start exercising more, then this simple case issue can improve and will often bounce back to normal function, thus the basic idea of eating less and exercising more to lose weight. If you continually eat too much and gain weight, then cells get tired of seeing insulin taxis driving up. In fact, they shutter their windows and lock their doors. The reason for this rejection of insulin is rather simple. If the cells take in blood sugar when they can't use it, because they already have enough, then the extra sugar will caramelize and kill the cell. Rejecting insulin is a self-defense measure. This is the mechanism behind basic insulin resistance at the cellular level. If this problem goes on, blood sugar levels continue to rise, insulin resistance gets worse, leptin resistance gets worse, cholesterol levels go up, blood pressure goes up, triglyceride levels go up, and inflammation really starts heating up. Eventually, this leads to type 2 diabetes, along with many risk factors for heart disease, and then heart and kidney disease lock into place. Basic Diet Recommendations for Insulin Function The absolute worst possible dietary pattern of eating for blood sugar health is the standard advice given by dieticians and doctors across the country for almost all type 2 diabetic patients. They routinely tell individuals to snack in order to maintain their blood sugar levels and to ""stoke"" their metabolism with fuel. In normal health, when you haven't eaten for three hours, insulin levels return to a baseline. Now your pancreas makes a different hormone, called glucagon. This hormone tells your liver to release the sugar (glycogen) it has stored to sustain your blood sugar levels, and as it does this it turns on your liver's fat burning system. Thus, under the influence of glucagon your liver simultaneously uses sugar and fat to sustain your blood sugar – a true fat burning time that helps clear up stagnating levels of triglycerides in your blood. If you snack on anything surpassing 30 calories you will raise insulin, which automatically turns off glucagon, causes fat burning to stop, and blunts the use of sugar that has been stored in your liver. However, since you haven't used the stored sugar in your liver, then insulin can't put more sugar back in your liver as it normally would, meaning it will readily turn blood sugar into fat (even if you snacked on something with no fat). You are supposed to get a snack between meals, but it is supposed to come from your liver, not from eating. The worst things for leptin and insulin are eating between meals, eating large meals, eating low fiber, eating highly refined sugar or refined carbohydrates, not eating enough quality protein, and not exercising.If you eat anything after dinner you make matters even worse, because now you reduce the optimal access into your stored fat during sleep, a prime opportunity to burn fat. When this system is abused and weight is gained, then fat begins to accumulate in excess in your liver. The fat clogs your liver's metabolism and reduces the ability of sugar to store in your liver following a meal. This is liver insulin resistance caused by fatty buildup. This means that you are much more likely to become hypoglycemic or have low blood sugar between meals, because you don't have enough sugar in your warehouse to use for blood sugar between meals. This same fatty liver problem also gets in the way of how glucagon would burn fat between meals, causing glucagon to synthesize sugar in an inappropriate and out-of-control manner, making blood sugar go high even though you haven't eaten. This is why diabetics wake up with very high fasting blood sugar levels. These are complicated metabolic problems that are more difficult to fix than simple case insulin resistance. Furthermore, your pancreas starts to tune out leptin, meaning that leptin resistance occurs at the level of beta cells and the beta cells aren't getting the leptin message to stop making insulin in a timely manner. This causes extra insulin to be made, which excessively lowers blood sugar by turning sugar to fat, while simultaneously inducing hypoglycemia or low blood sugar symptoms. This makes a person want to eat again two to three hours after the previous meal, in turn making the whole problem worse. It's about this time, with metabolism clogged and broken, that a young overweight person goes to the doctor and finds out he or she has type 2 diabetes. If the problem continues, then inflammation begins to damage the insulin secreting beta cells. Not only are these beta cells now leptin resistant, causing them to overproduce insulin and get tired out, but they are also getting damaged, and their numbers are declining – meaning now they can't make insulin either. This sends a person down a path of a mixture of type 1 and type 2 diabetes – with an autoimmune component sometimes thrown in; a problem that is seen progressively more often in today's older type 2 diabetics.How to Eat for Healthy Blood Sugar 1. Eat a high protein breakfast. Start your day off with high protein and low carbohydrates. Forget the muffin and orange juice for breakfast. That will cause you blood sugar to shoot up and you'll be hungry mid-morning. Instead, start your morning with 20-30 grams of protein and some healthy fats. This will improve your metabolism, help stabilize your blood sugar, and keep you full for 5 hours until lunchtime.2. Eat 3 meals per day with no snacking and no eating after dinner. This allows your body to use insulin and burn fat between meals. Leave 5-6 hours between meals and finish eating dinner at least 3 hours before bedtime.3. Don't overeat at meals. Always try to finish a meal when you are slightly less than full. It can take 15 minutes for the full signal to catch up to you. Eat slowly. Overeating at meals is the easiest way to clog your metabolism.4. Reduce carbohydrates eaten. Your body needs some carbohydrates. However, most people eat too many carbohydrates. An easy guide to follow is to look at the physical size of the carbohydrates you're eating at a meal in comparison to protein and use the 50-50 technique. For example, you can eat a palm-size portion of protein (such as chicken, fish, eggs) and should eat no more than a palm-size portion of carbohydrates (rice, potatoes, fruit, corn, bread). You can fill up on fiber-rich vegetables.5. Eat fiber at every meal, preferably at the beginning of the meal. Just think about starting a meal with a salad rather than bread. Soluble fiber is vital for slowing the rate at which calories enter your blood, thus enabling your insulin system to function with less stress. It also helps you maintain healthy levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. For weight loss, you want to get 30-50 grams of fiber each day.6. Retrain your sweet tooth. The less sugar you eat, the less you crave it. Once you start eating less sugar, your taste buds change so you don't need things to be so sweet. Cut out added sugars throughout your day. Cut out juices, soda, and refined sugars. If you crave dessert, try eating some fruit at the end of the meal. That should be enough sweetness to satisfy your taste buds.7. Exercise. Getting physical exercise is essential to utilize the calories you are eating. Make a point to get regular refreshing exercise and use your muscles for health!These guidelines are part of the Leptin Diet recommendations and are an optimal way of eating for blood sugar health, fat-burning, and thyroid function. It is a sustainable way of eating for ongoing health. It is not a starvation or deprivation diet. Make these simple changes today and improve your insulin function and overall health!To learn more about blood sugar and leptin, check out the books The Leptin Diet and Mastering Leptin.",https://t.co/fTyrZigz5p,news
Beneficial effects of oral chromium picolinate supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized clinical study,"JavaScript is disabled on your browser. Please enable JavaScript to use all the features on this page.Beneficial effects of oral chromium picolinate supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized clinical studyHighlights•Diabetic patients received 600 μg/day CrPic supplementation 4 months.•CrPic supplementation reduced fasting and postprandial glucose, and HbA1c values.•No changes in lipid profile were found in the supplemented group.AbstractBackgroundChromium is an essential mineral that contributes to normal glucose function and lipid metabolism. This study evaluated the effect of chromium picolinate (CrPic) supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).MethodsA four month controlled, single blind, randomized trial was performed with 71 patients with poorly controlled (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] &gt; 7%) T2DM divided into 2 groups: Control (n = 39, using placebo), and supplemented (n = 32, using 600 μg/day CrPic). All patients received nutritional guidance according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and kept using prescribed medications. Fasting and postprandial glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and serum ferritin were evaluated.ResultsCrPic supplementation significantly reduced the fasting glucose concentration (−31.0 mg/dL supplemented group; −14.0 mg/dL control group; p &lt; 0.05, post- vs. pre-treatment, in each group) and postprandial glucose concentration (−37.0 mg/dL in the supplemented group; −11.5 mg/dL in the control group; p &lt; 0.05). HbA1c values were also significantly reduced in both groups (p &lt; 0.001, comparing post- vs. pre-treatment groups). Post-treatment HbA1c values in supplemented patients were significantly lower than those of control patients. HbA1c lowering in the supplemented group (−1.90), and in the control group (−1.00), was also significant, comparing pre- and post-treatment values, for each group (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). CrPic increased serum chromium concentrations (p &lt; 0.001), when comparing the supplemented group before and after supplementation. No significant difference in lipid profile was observed in the supplemented group; however, total cholesterol, HDL-c and LDL-c were significantly lowered, comparing pre- and post-treatment period, in the control group (p &lt; 0.05).ConclusionsCrPic supplementation had a beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients with poorly controlled T2DM, without affecting the lipid profile. Additional studies are necessary to investigate the effect of long-term CrPic supplementation.KeywordsType 2 diabetes mellitusChromium picolinateDyslipidemiaDietary supplementsRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Scientists develop disposable paper sensors for diabetics to monitor blood sugar,"Press Trust of IndiaDec 24, 2018 09:55:18 ISTScientists have developed disposable paper-based sensors that can measure glucose concentrations in saliva, paving the way for a pain-free alternative to diabetics for monitoring their blood sugar levels daily. Strips of pH-sensitive paper are commonly used to test whether a liquid is acidic or alkaline. Researchers are now working to apply similar principles to create paper sensors that quickly indicate disease biomarkers.Paper sensors remove the sting of diabetic testing. Image: King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)Key to this approach is replacing traditional electronic circuitry in the sensors with low-cost plastics that can be manufactured quickly and in large quantities. A team from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia used inkjet technology to produce sensors sensitive to small sugar concentrations in biofluids. Utilising a commercial ink made from conducting polymers, the team printed microscale electrode patterns onto glossy paper sheets. They printed a sensing layer containing an enzyme, glucose oxidase, on top of the tiny electrodes.The biochemical reaction between available glucose and the enzyme creates electrical signals easily correlated to blood sugar levels. ""Paper is porous, which makes it challenging to print conducting and biological inks that are dissolved in water,"" said Eloise Bihar, a postdoctoral researcher at KAUST. ""Printing the enzyme is tricky, as well — it's sensitive to variations of temperature, the voltage applied at the cartridge, and the pH of the ink,"" said Bihar. While fluids, such as sweat or saliva, contain enough sugar for monitoring purposes, they also contain molecules, such as ascorbic acid, that interfere electrically with conducting polymers.Coating the sensor with a nafion polymer membrane that repels the negative charges present in most interfering species enabled measurement of only the relevant glucose levels in saliva samples from volunteers. Experiments showed the top coating gave the sensor an unprecedented shelf life — the enzyme could be kept alive and active for a month if stored in a sealed bag. These results are encouraging the team to expand the capabilities of this approach by incorporating different enzymes into the sensing layer.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market's Top Gainers, Top Losers &amp; Best Equity Funds.

Type-2 diabetes: Why this one drink could lower blood sugar levels,"Type-2 diabetes is a lifelong condition which causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to increase.In order to reduce symptoms, it is important to take medication and have regular check-ups.Another way to control type-2 diabetes is by watching what you eat and drink on a daily basis.The NHS recommends a range of foods, including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods, like pasta.Meanwhile, one certain hot drink has been found to contain blood sugar lowering qualities. In a 2012 study, called ""Coffee, Caffeine and Risk of Type-2 Diabetes"", found drinking coffee may help lower the risk of type-2 diabetes.The researchers found the level of risk dropped even lower for people who drank two to three cups a day.But it remains unclear what coffee components may be responsible for the apparent beneficial effect of coffee on glucose metabolism. ""It's fine to drink tea and coffee as part of a balanced diet""NHSThese results, which were tested on younger and middle-aged women in the US, showed for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees.According to the NHS, drinking three to four cups of coffee a day can reduce the risk of type-2 diabetes by 30%.It also found that the hot drink was linked to a lower risk of disease or death.However, it is important to enjoy coffee in moderation, as the NHS warned: ""It's fine to drink tea and coffee as part of a balanced diet, but it's important that these drinks are not your main or only source of fluid.""Meanwhile, if you're worried about developing type-2 diabetes, it is advised to visit your local GP.

Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?,"Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Raspberries are a delicious fruit that has been widely consumed for thousands of years. They are packed full of vitamins, minerals, and powerful antioxidants that may help prevent disease and promote health. Various studies have shown that the fruit holds a plethora of health benefits, ranging from improving cardiovascular health to preventing cancer. Raspberries are also found to be beneficial in preventing as well as managing type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that the fruit may also aid weight loss.Type 2 diabetes is a chronic health condition that causes the level of blood sugar (glucose) to rise. Over time, high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, can affect your health from head to toe, resulting in a number of complications, including heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, eye damage, etc. By keeping your blood sugar under control, you can avoid all these health problems. Eating a diet high in fibre can help keep blood sugar level stable. Raspberries boast of many nutrients, including fibre, despite being low in calories, making them a great food for diabetics.How can raspberries help prevent or treat type 2 diabetes?Previous studies have shown that consuming a high-fibre diet can help improve blood glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in type 2 diabetes. Two new studies, published in Obesity and Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, suggested that eating raspberries can significantly help prevent and manage diabetes.The first study, which investigated people with 'pre-diabetes' and insulin resistance, found that eating raspberries for breakfast can help reduce glucose levels two hours later. Likewise, the second study reported that eating berries were associated with lower blood sugar levels. The results from these trials suggested that raspberry consumption could be an important dietary component for people at risk of type-2 diabetes.Also, one study found that red raspberries have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolism-stabilising properties, all of which can help reduce the risk of several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study conducted at the Centre for Nutrition Research, Institute for Food Safety and Health, Illinois Institute of Technology, also found that red raspberries contain components that can also reduce heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, the two common complications of diabetes. The research was published in Advances in Nutrition.Other health benefits of raspberriesStudies have shown that fibre and water content in raspberries may help prevent and treat constipation, aiding in maintaining a healthy digestive tract. It's worth noting that increasing fibre intake has also been linked to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as boost weight loss.The bottom line is that eating low-calorie, high-nutrient foods like raspberries as part of a healthy diet may help manage diabetes, support weight loss, and boost health.

Victoza® demonstrated superiority in reducing blood sugar vs placebo in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes,"BALTIMORE, April 28, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Novo Nordisk today announced the results from the ELLIPSE trial which examined efficacy and safety and demonstrated superiority of Victoza® (liraglutide) injection 1.8 mg vs placebo in reducing blood sugar in children and adolescents aged 10-17 with type 2 diabetes.1 ELLIPSE is the first phase 3 trial completed in over a decade in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. These data were presented today at the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES)/Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) Annual Meeting in Baltimore, MD and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.2 Victoza® is currently indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. This study was designed to evaluate the investigational use of Victoza® in children and adolescents.The ELLIPSE trial included a 26-week, double-blinded treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period. The trial results showed that, when added to metformin, with or without concurrent basal insulin treatment, Victoza® significantly reduced A1C at both 26 weeks (primary endpoint) and 52 weeks (secondary endpoint), -0.64% and -0.50% respectively, versus placebo, where there was an increase in A1C at both 26 weeks and 52 weeks, +0.42% and +0.80% respectively (p&lt;0.001 for both).2 Additionally, the proportion of children and adolescents achieving A1C &lt;7% at week 26 (secondary endpoint) was significantly higher in those treated with Victoza® (63.7%) than in those treated with placebo (36.5%), p&lt;0.001.2""The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents is increasing, driven by the global epidemic of childhood obesity, yet our treatment options are limited,"" said Dr. William Tamborlane, professor and Chief of Endocrinology, Yale School of Medicine and ELLIPSE lead investigator. ""These data represent a potential new treatment option for lowering blood sugar in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes."" The results of the ELLIPSE trial have been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for evaluation as a potential treatment option for children 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes. ""We are delighted with the ELLIPSE trial results and look forward to discussions with the FDA and EMA about these data for Victoza®,"" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. ""These data add to the extensive evidence for the use of Victoza® and further cement Novo Nordisk's commitment to addressing a considerable and growing unmet medical need across the full spectrum of the type 2 diabetes patient population.""Overall, the safety profile of Victoza® seen in children and adolescents was similar to that seen in adults. In the trial, the percentage of children who reported an adverse event (AE) was similar in both groups (84.8% with Victoza® vs 80.9% with placebo). Gastrointestinal AEs occurred more frequently with Victoza® (33.3%) than placebo (13.2%).2 Adverse events greater than or equal to 5% in patients treated with Victoza® include headache, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, pyrexia and decreased appetite. Minor hypoglycemia occurred in 24.2% of patients treated with Victoza® vs 10.3% in the placebo arm. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia in patients treated with Victoza®.2About Victoza®Victoza® (liraglutide) injection 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on January 25, 2010, as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. In Europe, approved in 2009, Victoza® is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes together with diet and exercise, as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications and in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. Victoza® is commercially available in more than 100 countries, treating more than 1.2 million people with type 2 diabetes globally.3About ELLIPSEELLIPSE (NCT01541215) is a phase 3, multicenter trial in which 135 children 10-17 years of age were randomized 1:1 to treatment with Victoza® (liraglutide) up to 1.8 mg/day or placebo, in combination with metformin, with or without basal insulin, for a 26-week, double-blind period, followed by a 26-week open label extension for collection of additional data (total 52 weeks), as well as an additional 52 week off-treatment safety follow-up for people treated for more than 3 months with liraglutide.4About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a global healthcare company that's been making innovative medicines to help people with diabetes lead longer, healthier lives for 95 years.

'Looping' Created an Underground Insulin-Pump Market,"By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That's where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.They shared this code online as OpenAPS, and ""looping,"" as it's called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called Loop is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they've had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.Obviously, you can't just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. ""It's eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It's like this underground market for these pumps,"" says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of JDRF, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night's sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He'd wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an Edison. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. ""The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... "" he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. ""One day my wife was like, 'We haven't bought you apple juice in a long time,'"" he says. ""That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.""The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? ""You're always thinking, 'What is the next thing I'm going to be doing?'"" she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she's eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically ""hybrid"" closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. ""Every decision we make, we're trying to hit a bull's-eye. With Loop, all I'm trying to do is get the dart on the board,"" explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone's signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn't lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to one small study and many, many anecdotes, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.",https://t.co/RMouUVvxih,news
Reverse Diabetes Today System,"Reverse Diabetes Today is a Natural and Safe Solution by Matt Traverso that offers a 100% natural, safe, and powerful treatment that permanently eliminates the ROOT cause of your Diabetes.It's about reversing diabetes (a monstrous epidemic that shouldn't even exist!) and giving you the control, the information, and the means to take charge of your own health and kick Diabetes out of your life forever!It's about showing you the laws of nature and how your own body and mind are designed to achieve and maintain a state of perfect health.In 3 short weeks you could be completely diabetes free! No more expensive prescription medications or painful insulin injections. No more sticking your fingers and monitoring your blood sugar like a hawk.Diabetes is a condition in which sugar is not properly absorbed by the body. Globally the incidence of diabetes is expected to exceed 250 million people by 2025 – resulting in 35 million heart attacks, 13 million strokes, 6 million episodes of renal failure, 8 million instances of blindness or eye surgery, 2 million amputations and 62 million deaths – that is a measure of the scale of the problem. While diabetes belongs at the top of the healthcare agenda, it has yet to be given that position.According to the American Diabetes Association, there are 21 million diabetics in America; with another 54 million people having pre-diabetes (placing them at high risk for developing Type II diabetes). This equates to 75 million Americans having diabetes, or being at high risk.With attention focused on blood sugar and insulin levels, however, the underlying cause of all the devastation has been overlooked. According to health advocate and best-selling author Matt Traverso, many doctors are failing to treat the real underlying cause of diabetes. Instead, they are treating the symptoms with chemicals and pharmaceutical medications that often leave the sufferers with side effects and a long term dependency on these drugs.What some doctors may be failing to understand is that diabetes is not a disease, it is an outward reaction coming directly from the pancreas that results in the body no longer being able to produce normal amounts of insulin due to the pancreas being run down.Matt Traverso's E-Book states, if the damage that is being done to the pancreas can be turned around, the organ will be given the chance to heal itself and then, gradually, it is possible for those who are dependent on insulin shots to be able to stop them all together. This means diabetes sufferers may no longer have to be dependant on the drugs and medications that are usually taken to treat the condition.Top scientists such as Dr Robert O. Young, Dr Gabriel Cousens, Dr Fuhrman and many others (whose groundbreaking research forms the basis of this E-book) state that ""diabetes is completely reversible"".This information sheds new light on how diabetes sufferers get the condition and how they can turn their illness around for good. The new finding on diabetes is being called ""The Diabetes-Reversing Breakthrough"" all through the western world. I would like to extend the opportunity to anyone who either suffers from type 1 or type 2 diabetes, or is at high risk of getting the disease, to learn more about ""The Diabetes-Reversing Breakthrough!""So if you want to find out more about this, then just visit this link now: Read more…",https://t.co/wy9bNdV7Y6,news

Type-2 diabetes symptoms: The one sign you must NEVER ignore,"According to the NHS, type-2 diabetes is a lifelong condition which causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to increase.In order to reduce symptoms, those who suffer from the condition must take medication and have regular check-ups.Signs to look out for include weight loss, fatigue and extreme thirst.But there's one thing you must always keep an eye on as it could indicate your blood sugar levels are rising. Noticing a change in your eyes is an early sign of type-2 diabetes, according to Diabetes UK.The changing of fluid levels in the body due to blood glucose level changes the shape of the eye and their ability to focus.An excess of sugar in the blood damages the tiny blood vessels in eyes.A type-2 diabetes sufferer who leaves this condition untreated could cause damage to the blood vessels which could make a permanent vision loss happen. ""Blurring vision may also occur as a result of very low blood sugar levels""Diabetes UKDiabetes UK says: ""High levels of blood sugar resulting from diabetes can affect your ability to see by causing the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in temporary blurring of the eyesight.""Blurring vision may also occur as a result of very low blood sugar levels. If your blood sugar levels are fluctuating over time, you may notice that your vision improves and worsens for periods of time.""You might find that your vision is blurry because fluid is leaking into the lens of your eye.Macular edema is the build-up of fluid in the macula (an area in the centre of the retina) which could lead to vision loss.This fluid can cause your vision to become more blurred over time.If you're worried about developing type-2 diabetes, it's advised to visit your local GP. TYPE-2 DIABETES: Symptoms include weight loss and blurred vision (Pic: GETTY) Alternatively, look out for the following symptoms:1. Peeing more than usual, particularly at night2. Feeling thirsty all the time3. Feeling very tired4. Losing weight without trying to5. Itching around your penis or vagina, or repeatedly getting thrush6. Blurred vision EYESIGHT: The condition could cause blurred vision (Pic: GETTY) The NHS states that you're more at risk of developing type-2 diabetes if you:1. Are over 40 – or 25 for south Asian people2. Have a close relative with the condition3. Are overweight or obese4. Are of south Asian, Chinese, African Caribbean or black African origin – even if you were born in the UK",https://t.co/PqwyDDlf0O,news
How to Eat for Blood Sugar Health,"It's essential to understand blood sugar health and how to eat in an optimal way to support healthy insulin function. This will help you more easily burn fat for fuel, keep weight off, and support overall health throughout your life.Blood Sugar 101 When you eat any food, even fat, your insulin level will rise. Higher amounts of refined carbohydrates or simple sugars will raise your insulin faster and in higher amounts. The greater the fiber content of your diet, the slower insulin is raised and the more controlled the process. When you eat a large meal, regardless of the type of calories, it causes a large surge in insulin that is difficult to manage. Insulin is a taxicab for calories. Its goal is to take blood sugar, as its passenger, to various locations in your body that want it. It helps if you are active, as some of the sugar is more likely to be wanted by cells in your body, including your many muscle cells. Blood sugar is fuel, like gasoline is to a car. Your brain must have a regular supply or your head conks out. Thus, following a meal your insulin taxis are busy transporting sugar through your circulation and out to your cells, hoping to find cells that need some sugar. In a healthy person, insulin drops off a whopping 60 percent of the sugar at your liver, which acts as a warehouse, converting the blood sugar to glycogen for storage. Insulin is released by your pancreas in two phases. The first phase is from insulin that is already made and stored in your pancreas, which is just waiting for some food to come along. This is your first wave of taxis coming to pick up the first set of blood sugar passengers. The release of this insulin triggers your pancreas' beta cells to start making more insulin to deal with the rest of the meal. As you are eating, some of the insulin transports blood sugar to your white adipose tissue or stored fat. The blood sugar is taken up by fat cells, activating their metabolism, in turn producing the hormone leptin. Leptin now enters your blood and begins traveling up to your brain. The more you eat, the more insulin you make, and the more leptin you make. When leptin levels get high enough, meaning you have eaten enough, then leptin permeates into your brain and tells your subconscious brain you are full. At the same time, the higher levels of leptin also tell your pancreas that you are full, which turns off the beta cell production of insulin, as no more taxis are needed. If you ate the right amount of food for your physical activity level, then blood sugar always has some place healthy to go; insulin rises and falls in a controlled manner, as does leptin. When insulin has too many blood sugar passengers, and cells don't need any sugar, then insulin stimulates the production of triglycerides, which can become stored fat. This is how you gain weight. Unfortunately, as triglycerides elevate in your blood, they interfere with leptin getting into your brain. This keeps you eating more than you need to because you don't yet have a full signal, a problem called leptin resistance. This encourages even further insulin driven triglyceride formation, making it morelikely you will gain weight. If you stop eating too much and start exercising more, then this simple case issue can improve and will often bounce back to normal function, thus the basic idea of eating less and exercising more to lose weight. If you continually eat too much and gain weight, then cells get tired of seeing insulin taxis driving up. In fact, they shutter their windows and lock their doors. The reason for this rejection of insulin is rather simple. If the cells take in blood sugar when they can't use it, because they already have enough, then the extra sugar will caramelize and kill the cell. Rejecting insulin is a self-defense measure. This is the mechanism behind basic insulin resistance at the cellular level. If this problem goes on, blood sugar levels continue to rise, insulin resistance gets worse, leptin resistance gets worse, cholesterol levels go up, blood pressure goes up, triglyceride levels go up, and inflammation really starts heating up. Eventually, this leads to type 2 diabetes, along with many risk factors for heart disease, and then heart and kidney disease lock into place. Basic Diet Recommendations for Insulin Function The absolute worst possible dietary pattern of eating for blood sugar health is the standard advice given by dieticians and doctors across the country for almost all type 2 diabetic patients. They routinely tell individuals to snack in order to maintain their blood sugar levels and to ""stoke"" their metabolism with fuel. In normal health, when you haven't eaten for three hours, insulin levels return to a baseline. Now your pancreas makes a different hormone, called glucagon. This hormone tells your liver to release the sugar (glycogen) it has stored to sustain your blood sugar levels, and as it does this it turns on your liver's fat burning system. Thus, under the influence of glucagon your liver simultaneously uses sugar and fat to sustain your blood sugar – a true fat burning time that helps clear up stagnating levels of triglycerides in your blood. If you snack on anything surpassing 30 calories you will raise insulin, which automatically turns off glucagon, causes fat burning to stop, and blunts the use of sugar that has been stored in your liver. However, since you haven't used the stored sugar in your liver, then insulin can't put more sugar back in your liver as it normally would, meaning it will readily turn blood sugar into fat (even if you snacked on something with no fat). You are supposed to get a snack between meals, but it is supposed to come from your liver, not from eating. The worst things for leptin and insulin are eating between meals, eating large meals, eating low fiber, eating highly refined sugar or refined carbohydrates, not eating enough quality protein, and not exercising.If you eat anything after dinner you make matters even worse, because now you reduce the optimal access into your stored fat during sleep, a prime opportunity to burn fat. When this system is abused and weight is gained, then fat begins to accumulate in excess in your liver. The fat clogs your liver's metabolism and reduces the ability of sugar to store in your liver following a meal. This is liver insulin resistance caused by fatty buildup. This means that you are much more likely to become hypoglycemic or have low blood sugar between meals, because you don't have enough sugar in your warehouse to use for blood sugar between meals. This same fatty liver problem also gets in the way of how glucagon would burn fat between meals, causing glucagon to synthesize sugar in an inappropriate and out-of-control manner, making blood sugar go high even though you haven't eaten. This is why diabetics wake up with very high fasting blood sugar levels. These are complicated metabolic problems that are more difficult to fix than simple case insulin resistance. Furthermore, your pancreas starts to tune out leptin, meaning that leptin resistance occurs at the level of beta cells and the beta cells aren't getting the leptin message to stop making insulin in a timely manner. This causes extra insulin to be made, which excessively lowers blood sugar by turning sugar to fat, while simultaneously inducing hypoglycemia or low blood sugar symptoms. This makes a person want to eat again two to three hours after the previous meal, in turn making the whole problem worse. It's about this time, with metabolism clogged and broken, that a young overweight person goes to the doctor and finds out he or she has type 2 diabetes. If the problem continues, then inflammation begins to damage the insulin secreting beta cells. Not only are these beta cells now leptin resistant, causing them to overproduce insulin and get tired out, but they are also getting damaged, and their numbers are declining – meaning now they can't make insulin either. This sends a person down a path of a mixture of type 1 and type 2 diabetes – with an autoimmune component sometimes thrown in; a problem that is seen progressively more often in today's older type 2 diabetics.How to Eat for Healthy Blood Sugar 1. Eat a high protein breakfast. Start your day off with high protein and low carbohydrates. Forget the muffin and orange juice for breakfast. That will cause you blood sugar to shoot up and you'll be hungry mid-morning. Instead, start your morning with 20-30 grams of protein and some healthy fats. This will improve your metabolism, help stabilize your blood sugar, and keep you full for 5 hours until lunchtime.2. Eat 3 meals per day with no snacking and no eating after dinner. This allows your body to use insulin and burn fat between meals. Leave 5-6 hours between meals and finish eating dinner at least 3 hours before bedtime.3. Don't overeat at meals. Always try to finish a meal when you are slightly less than full. It can take 15 minutes for the full signal to catch up to you. Eat slowly. Overeating at meals is the easiest way to clog your metabolism.4. Reduce carbohydrates eaten. Your body needs some carbohydrates. However, most people eat too many carbohydrates. An easy guide to follow is to look at the physical size of the carbohydrates you're eating at a meal in comparison to protein and use the 50-50 technique. For example, you can eat a palm-size portion of protein (such as chicken, fish, eggs) and should eat no more than a palm-size portion of carbohydrates (rice, potatoes, fruit, corn, bread). You can fill up on fiber-rich vegetables.5. Eat fiber at every meal, preferably at the beginning of the meal. Just think about starting a meal with a salad rather than bread. Soluble fiber is vital for slowing the rate at which calories enter your blood, thus enabling your insulin system to function with less stress. It also helps you maintain healthy levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. For weight loss, you want to get 30-50 grams of fiber each day.6. Retrain your sweet tooth. The less sugar you eat, the less you crave it. Once you start eating less sugar, your taste buds change so you don't need things to be so sweet. Cut out added sugars throughout your day. Cut out juices, soda, and refined sugars. If you crave dessert, try eating some fruit at the end of the meal. That should be enough sweetness to satisfy your taste buds.7. Exercise. Getting physical exercise is essential to utilize the calories you are eating. Make a point to get regular refreshing exercise and use your muscles for health!These guidelines are part of the Leptin Diet recommendations and are an optimal way of eating for blood sugar health, fat-burning, and thyroid function. It is a sustainable way of eating for ongoing health. It is not a starvation or deprivation diet.

Dealing With Unexplained Blood Sugar Spikes,"Take steps to keep your blood sugar from rising. Martin Barraud/Getty Images Sign Up for Our Living with Diabetes NewsletterThanks for signing up!You can do everything right to keep your diabetes under control — eat a smart diet, exercise, take medications as prescribed, and follow your doctor's instructions for blood sugar monitoring — and still wake up in the morning with unexplained blood sugar spikes.Even in people who don't have diabetes, blood sugars fluctuate constantly, says Linda M. Siminerio, RD, PhD, director of the University of Pittsburgh's Diabetes Institute. But when you have diabetes and wake up with an increase in blood sugar levels, you shouldn't ignore it.If high blood sugar happens once in a while and you're able to get it under control quickly with insulin or exercise, it may be nothing serious. ""Maybe you have high blood sugar in the morning because you went to a party last night and had a bigger piece of birthday cake,"" Dr. Siminerio says. ""Or it snowed, and you couldn't go for your morning run the day before."" But if you consistently wake up with blood sugar spikes and don't know why, you need to investigate the cause. You may need to adjust your diabetes treatment plan, possibly changing your medication.You won't feel right if you have high blood sugar, a condition known as hyperglycemia, says Anuj Bhargava, MD, president of the Iowa Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center in Des Moines and founder of My Diabetes Home, an online platform that helps users track their blood sugar and manage their medication. When your blood sugar is too high for a few days or weeks, it can cause more frequent urination, increased thirst, weight loss, blurry vision, fatigue, and nausea. It also can make you more susceptible to infections. When you have high blood sugar for a long time, it can damage the vessels that supply blood to your heart, kidneys, nerves, and eyes, and cause serious health problems, says Dr. Bhargava.Finding the Cause of Increased Blood Sugar LevelsA number of things can be responsible for high blood sugar:If you have type 1 diabetes, you may not have taken enough insulin before bed or your insulin pump may have stopped working properly.If you have type 2 diabetes, the insulin you take may not be as effective as it needs to be.You might have a cold or the flu. When you're sick, your body releases hormones that help you fight off the germs that are attacking you. These hormones can interfere with insulin's ability to lower your blood sugar.You're stressed out from recent activities. If you're under stress and not sleeping well, your body releases stress hormones, which again lower your ability to make insulin and process blood sugar.You ate more carbohydrates the day before than you normally do.You exercised less during the day than you normally do. When you exercise, your muscles take up glucose (sugar) much faster, resulting in lower blood sugar.You could have what's known as the ""dawn phenomenon."" Experienced by everyone, even those who don't have diabetes, the dawn phenomenon is part of your body's natural biological rhythms. Pre-dawn, usually between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m., your pancreas releases a surge of hormones, including glucagon and cortisol, and temporarily slows down insulin secretion. In response, your liver releases more glucose into your bloodstream. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't release enough insulin to adjust properly to this early morning surge of glucose, so you wake up with high blood sugar.You could be experiencing ""the Somogyi effect"" and rebound hyperglycemia. This usually happens early in the morning. If you've skipped your dinner or bedtime snack, or had a lighter dinner without adjusting your insulin doses, your blood glucose levels can drop after you've been sleeping awhile. If this happens, your liver tries to return them to normal and releases glucose into the blood. Your liver can overcompensate for low blood sugar and cause it to become too high.Emotions Can Spike, TooPeople often feel guilty when they have high blood sugar and can become depressed, Siminerio says. Try not to let the numbers determine your mood. ""People may think they caused their blood sugar to go too high or too low, but you need to understand it's not your fault,"" she says. ""You don't always have control over your blood sugars.""Managing diabetes and blood sugars isn't easy. ""You have to monitor your food every minute of every day, exercise, test your blood sugar, and take injections or medications,"" Siminerio says. ""That's not easy psychologically to deal with.""Preventing Your Blood Sugar From Going Too High To avoid increased blood sugar:Monitor your blood glucose regularly. Put this at the top of your to-do list. Monitor regularly and keep track of your results. Discuss your blood glucose monitoring results with your healthcare provider at your regular visits. But if you're having frequent unexplained blood sugar spikes, don't wait for your next appointment; call your doctor.Take your medication as prescribed. If your blood sugar fluctuates overnight, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or timing or may suggest that you try a different medication, Bhargava says. You may need to change your medication after a certain amount of time.Watch your diet. You may need to eat less. Work with a nutritionist to find the best meal plan for you — one that helps you control your diabetes day and night.Exercise. Exercise can lower your blood sugar because your muscles need to call on your stores of glucose for power. But, never exercise if you have ketones, a type of acid, in your urine. Exercising with ketones can be dangerous because it can cause your blood sugar to go even higher. Signs you have ketones: Your breath smells fruity, you're short of breath, your mouth feels dry, and you're nauseated and throwing up. You can also ask your doctor about testing for ketones in your urine at home with ketone strips.Reduce stress levels. Try relaxation techniques and activities that help you de-stress, especially before going to bed, so that you're able to sleep well.""Maintaining a consistency in blood sugar will make a big difference in how you feel,"" says Siminerio. Practice good diabetes management, including regular blood glucose monitoring, and keep an eye on your numbers. If you have several episodes of high blood sugar, don't wait to talk to your doctor: If you treat hyperglycemia when you first notice it, you can avoid problems later on.",https://t.co/1qwWh8oVbn,news

"Blood Sugar, Weight Gain and (Pre-)Diabetes","Do you know how your body regulates fat storage and weight?Did your doctor ever tell you how your body works so you could understand how you gain weight and/or why you have some health issues like diabetes?Yet, how could we possibly know what's good or bad for us if we don't know in the first place how our bodies work?I have talked in previous emails this summer about coffee, portion control, menstrual hormones, underactive thyroid, busy woman syndrome, the nervous system, and emotional eating. All these can create situations where we gain weight.But there is also a very important hormone that plays a role in how we store or burn fat, and how we gain and lose weight.This hormone is Insulin.Here's how it works.Most adults have about 1 gallon (5 liters) of blood in their bodies, and in that gallon, there is only 1 teaspoon of sugar!Our body only needs 1 single teaspoon of sugar (at most) at all times.If our blood sugar level were to rise to 3 teaspoons of sugar, we would quickly go into a hyperglycemic coma and die.So, our body works very hard to prevent this from happening by producing the hormone insulin.Insulin keeps your blood sugar at the appropriate level. Any meal, snack or drink high in grain and sugar carbohydrates typically generates a rapid rise in blood glucose. In order to compensate for this the pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream, which lowers our blood sugar to keep us from dying. What happens when you eat foods that contain sugar?Here is the sugar content of some very common sugary foods and drinks:If you eat 1 medium muffin with 1 cup commercial orange juice, your body has to get rid of the equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar in your blood!Insulin is released and does a good job of getting all this sugar out of your bloodstream.Now, if you consume a diet consistently high in sugar and grains, over time your body becomes ""sensitized"" to insulin and requires more and more of it to get the job done.Eventually, you can become insulin resistant, and then diabetic.If you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or are overweight, it may well be (note: it may be; I'm not saying it is) that you are eating (or drinking) too much sugar and too many grains as these are the most common culprits causing your insulin level to become abnormal.Now, what does the body do with all this sugar? If you are an athlete, it will most probably use it for energy.If you are highly active, say, 2 hours of exercise per day, plus some walking and standing for a few hours, your body may also use this sugar for energy.But if you are like most people, chances are you are only lightly active. Long hours at the office, a commute in your car, seating on the sofa at home, and maybe half an hour walk or housework here and there.In this case, here is what happens: all the sugar that insulin is taking out from your bloodstream will not be used as energy, but it will be stored as fat.When your insulin level rises due to high blood sugar, it sends your body a hormonal message telling it to store fat while holding on to the fat that is already there.So not only will excess carbohydrates make you gain weight, they will effectively hinder your weight loss efforts, too.Now, it's not about going cold turkey and depriving ourselves; it's about keeping it reasonable.Food for thought: in the 19th century in the U.S., people would consume the equivalent of 2 teaspoons of sugar per day. And there was no obesity at all. Now, it's 33 teaspoons of sugar per day…***** This is #10 of these nutrition and weight loss series.

Alternative treatments for type 2 Diabetes,"Some of the alternative treatments for diabetes include bitter melon, cinnamon, and chromium picolinate. While these might help lower your A1C, make a consultation with your health physician before you start using them in your diabetes diet.If you want to take your blood sugar under control, you can turn to many different solutions: regular exercise, leading a diet that is low on the glycemic index, regular sleep, stress management, and consistently taking your diabetes medication. However, for people with type 2 diabetes, following these guidelines is not that easy, as it can be difficult not to look for other solutions for this troublesome disease.It doesn't take long to find out what other people are thinking, as a quick Google search for alternative diabetes treatments can give you an astoundingly big list of results, ranging from acupuncture to miraculous diabetes ""cures"" one the very first search results page.With that much information at your fingertips, how can you be certain that it's true? Or to ask an even better question: What is safe?As a matter of fact, even though researchers haven't found a cure for diabetes, some alternative solutions exist for blood sugar management. Some of these solutions were found accidentally, while others were found by research. Some of them which are being used by regular people with diabetes come coupled with medial assurance.Bitter melon may help lower your A1CGreta Lint, from Ashboro, North Carolina, found out she has an A1C that usually means type 2 diabetes. Therefore, besides regular exercises, healthy diet, and diabetes medication, her endocrinologist advised her to give bitter melon a try. Bitter melon is a long and bitter gourd found in South America, parts of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. Her endocrinologist said that, ""anecdotally, all of his patients who have followed his advice have seen a considerable drop in their A1C.""Ms. Lint was able to find this fruit at a local Asian grocery store and started mixing the sun-dried slices with her tea. Even though this fruit made the tea have a bad aftertaste, three months after she started drinking it, she managed to lower her A1C levels from 6.5 (an indication for diabetes), to more normal levels of 5.9.It is her opinion that bitter melon had a role in this, something that is backed up by some research papers such as a study that was published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology which said that bitter melon has a ""modest"" effect on blood sugar levels. Do note that even though bitter melon might help with A1C levels, it doesn't mean you should stop taking your medication, as researchers pointed out that the hypoglycemic effect of bitter melon was equal to taking less than 1,000 milligrams of metformin a day – a typical dosage for diabetics, as reported by the Mayo Clinic.Magnesium supplements helps with nutritional deficiencyIf you are a person that has to deal with diabetes, yours or a loved one's – you are most certainly familiarized with the importance of protein, healthy fat, and fiber-rich foods, and the way they help regulate your blood sugar and waistline. However, diabetics, are also advised to take care of their magnesium levels, since they are typically in greater need of this mineral due to deficiency. That is what the doctor said to Jennifer Reich from Allentown, Pennsylvania, when she made a visit to his office due to her type 2 diabetes.This is also backed by research such as the review that was published in the journal Biological Trace Elements Research in which researchers noted that chronic magnesium deficiency is connected with insulin resistance, an indicator of type 2 diabetes.According to Carolyn Dean, MD, ND, a member of the medical advisory board at the Nutritional Magnesium Association in Kihei, Hawaii – magnesium is very important for the transfer of glucose to cells, which, in turn – provides energy for the whole body. If you develop insulin resistance, as many diabetics do, this process can't happen. ""If there is not enough magnesium to do this job, both insulin and glucose become elevated. The excess glucose gets stored as fat and contributes to weight gain and diabetes,"" says Dr. Dean, further noting that magnesium ""activates hundreds of enzymes that control digestion, absorption, and the utilization of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.""Warm milk with cinnamon and honey help prevent the Somogyi effectStephanie Rayman from Shalimar, Florida, was 32 when she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and this was probably hereditary, as her family had a history of this disease, in addition to her own history of gestational diabetes. However, she managed to lower her blood sugar by drinking warm milk with honey before she went to sleep. It is known that hydration is crucial for people with diabetes, and cinnamon has been proved to provide benefits for the disease, but what is the role of honey in all of this?According to Jewel Sheehan, MD, a resident in pediatrics and anesthesia at Stanford University in California, the combo of warm milk, cinnamon, and honey appear to have helped stabilize Rayman's blood sugar, and prevented the Somogyi effect, which increases the blood sugar levels during the morning.Grace Derocha, RD, CDE, a certified coach at Blue Cross Shield of Michigan in Detroit, says that the Somogyi effect appears when surplus insulin builds up in the bloodstream during the night, caused by the use of long-acting insulin or some late-night snacks that help blood sugar levels stabilization. ""This, in turn, drops blood sugars while sleeping, and then stored blood sugars are released into the blood,"" Derocha explains.While the Somogyi effect is rare, it can more commonly be found in type 1 diabetics, as revealed by a paper published in May 2013 in the journal Diabetic Medicine. It is not to be confused with the dawn phenomenon, which is a process that also leads to high blood sugar levels during the morning – but this happens due to increased hormone levels naturally secreted by your body to help you wake up. ""Whether you are diabetic or not, this happens to help everyone get up in the morning,"" Derocha says. However, ""when someone is diabetic, their body does not produce enough insulin, or the insulin is not able to respond in time to counteract the release of blood sugars."" Therefore, by drinking this milk, honey, and cinnamon combination, Rayman prevents her nightly hypoglycemia, including her morning hyperglycemia.However, Derocha notes that people that have high blood sugar levels during the morning might want to think twice before trying this combination since ""every person with diabetes will be different,"" and people should talk to their diabetes professional before resorting to using it.On the other hand, if you tend to have high blood sugar during the morning, you can still eat a snack before going to bed, just make sure it has 15 to 30 grams of carbohydrates, as well as lean proteins or healthy fats. The proteins and healthy fats will delay the impact carbohydrates have on your blood sugar levels simply because the body needs more time to digest them, according to Derocha. ""Honey and milk are both added sugars and carbohydrates,"" she says. ""Therefore, adding them along with a lean protein for a bedtime snack could help people with diabetes avoid high morning blood sugar.""However, Derocha issues a warning not to use this mixture if you want to manage your everyday diabetes. Even though cinnamon and tea are included in recommended diabetes diets for their calorie-free contents, honey and full-fat milk can negate the benefits of this drink. ""When a person with diabetes adds honey, a natural sweetener with carbohydrates and sugar; or milk, a carbohydrate food source that has natural dairy sugar, or lactose; it will then impact their blood sugar,"" Derocha says.Cinnamon helps lower blood sugarCinnamon, on the other side – can greatly help if you include it in your diabetes diet. Some research shows that cinnamon might have a role in regulating blood sugar levels with type 2 diabetics. According to a research published in September 2013 in the journal Annals of Family Medicine pointed out that cinnamon can also help lower fasting glucose levels, reduce LDL, manage ""bad"" cholesterol levels, and, on top of that – it doesn't affect your A1C.Derocha also adds that ""cinnamon does not give any carbohydrate or sugar calories to increase human blood sugar, but it still gives you that taste of sweetness that you may be craving.""She suggests using cinnamon to add some sweetness to yogurt, cereals, oatmeal, cottage cheese, tea, coffee, or any other foods or dink you might want sweetened. ""Adding cinnamon to peanut butter to dip apples into or use as a spread is also fun. It can be a great addition to baking where one can then cut added sugars from the recipe,"" Derocha adds.Chromium Picolniate supplements promote insulin productionShelby Miller from Columbia, South Carolina said, ""I'm not diabetic, but I know enough to take chromium."" She added that this supplement helped her lower her blood sugar levels. And she might be correct, as a study published in the journal Diabetes showed that picolinate might help type 2 diabetics improve their A1C results, glucose tolerance, insulin production, and cholesterol levels.According to Robin Foroutan, RDN, who is a holistic counselor in New York City, even though it's unclear how exactly chromium works, this mineral seems to increase insulin's signaling activity and, which leads to lower blood sugar levels. ""Furthermore, there is evidence that people with a chromium deficiency tend to have elevated blood sugars or are insulin resistant,"" Foroutan adds.And now, the obvious question: How much chromium is needed to benefit from it? Foroutan says that 200 to 500 micrograms of chromium a day is recommended dose. ""Too much chromium can actually worsen blood sugar control, though toxicity is rare,"" she says.The easiest way to find out if you need to take chromium supplements is by adding chromium to your diet and check if it does anything for your blood sugar levels – not before you have consulted with your doctor, though. Foroutan also suggests to fortify your diet with multivitamins, as well. ""Depleted stores of any trace mineral can have big impacts on how the body functions, and because different minerals affect each other's absorption, taking these minerals together in a multivitamin or multimineral is ideal,"" she explains.Shelby Miller's way of adding chromium to her diet is in yeast form, which is naturally found in brewer's yeast. It is worth noting that there isn't much research done on the level of absorption for the yeast or picolniate forms of chromium.Green tea helps with blood glucose management and lowering diabetes riskDrinking green tea in the morning and during the night has been proven to help manage blood sugar levels. It is advised to follow every and any naturopathic research being done, and decide which type of tea to drink. In general, most researchers suggest drinking green tea, saying that it provides many benefits for diabetics.This might be due to the fact that green tea is full of polyphenols, a type of antioxidants that promote our metabolism and hinder amylase – an enzyme that turns carbohydrates into glucose. ""This, in turn, could decrease the breakdown and absorption of glucose into the blood,"" Derocha says.A study that was published in April 2016 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine promote the idea that drinking tea can help manage diabetes. The researchers went through information from 25 Japanese communities and their research showed that drinking tea was connected with lower diabetes risks.At the same time, a study published in the journal Phytochemistry showed that green tea also helps control glucose levels, lower the risks of heart disease, and help with weight loss.Things to keep an eye to when looking for alternative diabetes treatmentEven though the treatments we mentioned in this article have proved themselves to be helpful for some people with diabetes, you are advised to consult with your personal physician before making any significant changes to your diet and lifestyle – and this is of extreme importance when trying out alternative treatments, Emmy Suhl, RD, CDE, at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Since supplements aren't under regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), their quality and dosages aren't clear.It's also worth pointing out that supplements might have negative side-effects for your diabetes condition, or might have adverse effects when coupled with any medications you might be taking, Suhl warns. In some cases, if your doctor doesn't know which supplements you're using, he or she might prescribe a medication that lowers your blood sugar levels, which, when coupled with your supplements – might lower your blood sugar to unsafe levels.Other issues might negate the success of the treatments as well. For example, if you don't have magnesium deficiency, taking a supplement might not have any beneficial effect at all. On the other hand, if you do have magnesium deficiency, you might not be taking the recommended dose and you won't see any results at all.Moreover, various studies have shown different and often contradicting results as to the beneficial effect of supplements on people, diabetics or not. ""That's not to say they don't help, but to date, research studies have not established this is the case,"" and because of that, the American Diabetes Association doesn't recommend them.",https://t.co/un67j976Ka,news
Reactive hypoglycemia: Trying to beat the sugar crash,"With the long healthcare waits, I knew there had to be a way of improving my situation in the meantime. My step mum – who used to be a clinical practice nurse – and I tried to piece together the information from the symptoms and patterns. From that we worked out that I was experiencing postpandrial hypoglycemia.I spent hours trawling the internet for information – perhaps like you are doing now! I knew I had to make sense of this craziness. I kissed goodbye to my chocolate, wine, coffee, G&amp;Ts and refine carbs. I studied the Low Glycemic Index for foods I could eat which wouldn't cause a blood sugar spike but instead released it slowly into my system. I was amazed at how many of my best food friends had been the dirty culprits. I began eating every two hours on the clock. I changed my whole way of eating and my day began to revolve around food in a way it had never done before. By the end of the first day, I was sick of eating. I wondered whether this was my life now – eating every two hours in some kind of forced feeding reactive hypoglycemia hell. Well I'm telling you now as I write this that thankfully it was not! But at the time I remember eating a slice of wholemeal toast and peanut butter before I went to bed, chewing on it like it was sawdust I was so sick of eating!And then there were the nights. The nights when I just couldn't get to sleep, and would then have terrible symptoms so then would have to eat again. So many nights when I would be eating until 2am then finally get to sleep. I didn't know if this was the right thing to do at the time but it's what I felt I should do. With hindsight this was probably only making things worse!But hey, that's what happens when you're on a mission to beat that reactive hypoglycemia sugar crash.Thank goodness for the Low Glycemic Index is all I can say. But here's a spoiler: there's something even better than following the Low Glycemic Index for beating the reactive hypoglycemia blood sugar crash, which I will share later on.

"Study claims tequila may help with weight loss, lowering blood sugar levels","The study is from 2014, but the idea of tequila as a secret for weight loss has recently been making the rounds again. (iStock)A margarita a day keeps the doctor away? Not so much. But research presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society suggests that a little tequila might hypothetically help keep extra pounds away — they say sweeteners in tequila called agavins could actually help you lose weight.The study is from 2014, but the idea of tequila as a secret for weight loss has recently been making the rounds again — the appeal is fairly obvious. And this isn't the first time tequila has been touted for its health benefits. It's one of the only alcohols you can drink on the keto diet — and the spirit has been credited with miracle powers such as lowering cholesterol and aiding in digestion. But the study presented to ACS suggests the spirit has the power to do even more.Tequila is made using the agave plant, which contains sugars called agavins. Simple sugars in many food products can raise your blood sugar; this effect is what connects many added sugars to diseases like Type 2 diabetes. The sugars in agave called agavins are non-digestible, meaning they don't raise your blood sugar when you consume them.The researchers tested agavins on mice — though not in the form of tequila. The mice stayed sober; the agavins were added in a purer form to their drinking water. The mice that had agavins added to their water ended up with lower blood sugar levels. They also ate less and showed a stronger insulin response.""This puts agavins in a tremendous position for their consumption by obese and diabetic people,"" study authors said.So can tequila, which is ideally made with 100 percent agave, help you lose weight? Should pre-diabetics be doing shots?""I think the findings about the connection between agavins and weight loss in mice are interesting,"" says registered dietitian Jenny Friedman, ""but let's put this in perspective. Agavins and tequila are very different things — as are mice and humans. It's a lot to make the jump that tequila can cause weight loss in humans based on the results seen in the study with agavins and mice.""Agavins aren't the only thing you consume when you down a shot of tequila. You're also consuming alcohol, which isn't exactly a weight loss supplement. And if you're drinking tequila in a cocktail, there are likely lots of other added sugars and components to the drink.""As much as I'm sure some would love for it to be true, it's simply unrealistic to expect that drinking any alcohol would promote weight loss,"" Friedman says. Sorry, tequila fans: This is an alcohol myth that just isn't true.",https://t.co/7IGtWKGE8F,news
"Alexa, What's My Blood-Sugar Level?","Amazon may be known as the ""everything store, but the company's tendrils extend far beyond ecommerce. On Thursday, Amazon said Alexa-enabled devices can now handle customers' sensitive medical data, and it teased the release of a new kit that would allow approved outside developers to build Alexa skills that access users' private health information, paving the way for the voice assistant to play a bigger role in health care.With the announcement came the release of new skills giving Alexa the ability to relay and store blood sugar measurements from internet-connected monitoring devices, help schedule doctors' appointments, pass on post-op instructions from hospitals, and provide prescription delivery updates by securely accessing customers' private medical information.As part of the announcement, Amazon said it had committed to protect personal health information according to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which protects the privacy of medical records. Alexa's health and wellness team had been working to obtain HIPAA compliance for months. For now, only six companies invited by Amazon will be able to build skills that can access sensitive medical information, but Amazon expects to add more developers to that list in the coming months.In a statement to WIRED, Amazon said that while the company applies multiple layers of security to all skill dataâ€""including encryption, access controls, and secure storage in the Amazon cloudâ€""the health care skills data will be treated differently to meet HIPAA requirements. The company did not specify what additional measures are in place to ensure that users' personal health information is properly identified and access to it is controlled and properly audited.The move is a sign of Amazon's growing ambitions in health care and consumer-facing uses of its technology. The company has made dozens of high-profile health care hires in recent years.Since 2014, Amazon has been running a secretive lab dedicated to moon-shot-style projects in health care, like using machine learning to help prevent and treat cancer. The lab goes by at least three different names, depending on who you askâ€""including 1492, The Amazon Grand Challenge, and Amazon Xâ€""and it has worked on projects related to telemedicine and the development of health applications for Alexa-enabled devices, per CNBC. The group also reportedly spent years working on a tool to mine patient medical records for data to flag potentially inaccurate information and fill in gaps in a patient's medical history for insurance companies, among others.Last year, Amazon partnered with JP Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to launch a new health care ventureâ€""only recently given the name Havenâ€""ostensibly designed to revamp health care while cutting costs.In June, Amazon bought online pharmacy startup PillPack, which ships prescription medications directly to customers' doorsteps, for $1 billion in cash. Amazon has also started selling medical supplies to hospitals and medical professionals.In November, the company launched Amazon Comprehend Medical, a machine learning tool that mines doctors' notes and patient health records for data about a patient's diagnoses and medications.

"Ketogenic Diet and Cancer Treatment, What Patients Should Know","By Author Mya NelsonPosted on September 17, 2018September 19, 2018The ketogenic diet is a hot topic these days, with news stories and multiple health claims spurring interest in this extremely high-fat and low-carb diet plan. One major area of activity centers around how the ketogenic diet may help individuals diagnosed with cancer.The theories behind this potential health benefit are not new; they go back nearly 100 years. But emerging research in cellular metabolism and a handful of recent studies – including an AICR-supported study published in August – are adding insights into the possible effects of the ketogenic diet during cancer treatment.""This is an important area of research that has the potential to significantly improve treatment responses,"" said AICR's Director of Research Nigel Brockton, Ph.D. ""There are plausible mechanisms by which the ketogenic diet could help make treatment more effective, but, as we see many times, plausibility alone is not enough; it has to be tested. That's why we are supporting research in this area.""Currently, no major cancer health organizations, including AICR, recommend the ketogenic diet for cancer patients – or for cancer prevention.Note: The ketogenic diet was developed in the 1920s to curb seizures. Today, it is an accepted medical option for children with epilepsy who do not respond to standard treatment. Other disease-related health claims continue to be investigated.About the ketogenic dietTake a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet to the extreme and you have the basics of the ketogenic diet.The average American eats close to half of our calories – 47 to 50 percent – from carbohydrates, 33 percent from fat and 16 percent from protein.The classic ketogenic diet is composed of 5 percent or fewer of daily calories from carbohydrates, 80 percent from fat, and 15 percent from protein. For someone on a 2,000 calorie diet that means eating less than 25 grams of carbs per day – about the amount in one apple.This diet is challenging for many individuals to follow long-term. There are versions of it that contain more carbs, especially the plans targeted in the popular press. For someone undergoing cancer treatment, even proponents of the ketogenic diet note that it should be closely supervised by one's health-care team.How the diet relates to cancerAll of our cells need the energy to survive and the fuel for that energy comes from the digestion and metabolism of food. The fuel of choice for most cells is glucose (sugar); it is delivered to cells from the blood, primarily from the digestion of carbohydrates.A healthy cell pulls in glucose that then goes through a series of reactions with oxygen to produce usable energy.In the 1920s, German scientist Otto Warburg found that cancer cells fuel their growth through metabolizing a large amount of glucose. Unlike the average healthy cell, he saw that cancer cells were converting glucose into energy without using oxygen, even when oxygen was readily available. Now called the Warburg effect, this phenomenon is seen in about 80 percent of cancers.The oxygen-free pathway used by cancer cells needs a lot more glucose to produce the same amount of energy as an oxygen-using cell. This realization led to imaging techniques where cancer cells can be detected by spotting where large amounts of a glucose tracer accumulate in the body. The glucose used in this technique contains a small amount of radioactive material that lights up in the image.If our body doesn't have access to glucose, it will eventually start to produce ketones in the liver from fatty acids and amino acids.Healthy cells can use ketones for energy but cancer cells may not be able to as easily. Fasting for several days or extended aerobic exercise are both ways that can shift the body towards using ketones for fuel; a ketogenic diet is another. The ketogenic diet attempts to deprive cancer cells of their primary energy source – glucose.The ketogenic-cancer evidenceCancer is increasingly being studied as a metabolic disorder, not just a genetic one. This has renewed interest in the Warburg effect and the ketogenic diet.The vast majority of claims regarding the ketogenic diet and cancer are drawn from lab and animal studies. Findings from animal studies are revealing. A study published in July's Nature found that in mice, the ketogenic diet enhanced the effects of a specific cancer treatment. The drugs in that treatment targeted a signaling network guided by an enzyme (abbreviated P13K), which is commonly mutated in cancers.Consuming foods with carbohydrates increases sugar levels in the blood, which leads to insulin production. Insulin could then activate P13K signaling in tumors. By feeding mice a ketogenic diet, insulin levels were kept low and the drug was more effective, the study concluded.Yet the study also found that the ketogenic diet alone, in some cases, had no effect on the cancer or actually accelerated the growth of leukemia in mice. It may be harmful for patients with cancer when used in isolation, the authors note.Translating animal findings to a study of cancer patients is challenging, given each person's unique diagnosis, treatment needs and the challenge of following such an extreme diet. The relatively few human trials completed in this field are small, lasting from days to months. Most involve advanced cancers and some deal only with adherence.Current evidence among cancer patients is unclear and articles have reached different conclusions: A 2017 review article found the evidence of ketogenic diets on cancer and treatment side effects ""missing"".AICR-supported randomized-controlled studyOne randomized-controlled trial examining the effects of a ketogenic diet in cancer patients was recently published in August. The study was AICR-supported and published in The Journal of Nutrition.The AICR-supported study investigated whether the ketogenic diet can shift the metabolic environment to one proposed to be unfavorable for tumor growth among women diagnosed with ovarian and endometrial cancers.In the study, Barbara A. Gower, Ph.D., and her colleagues analyzed data from 45 women diagnosed with ovarian and endometrial cancers. The women were randomly assigned to either a ketogenic or a standard, healthy diet group. The ketogenic group was asked to consume 70 percent of calories from fat, 25 percent from protein and 5 percent from carbohydrates. The comparison diet was one recommended by the American Cancer Society, high in whole grains and fruit and low in added sugar.After three months, women in the ketogenic diet group had lower levels of insulin and an insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in their blood than the comparison group.This study demonstrates not only high feasibility but also that a ketogenic diet can shift the metabolic environment among women with ovarian and endometrial cancers, said Gower, a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Nutrition Obesity Research Center. Further study in a clinical setting is needed to determine whether the ketogenic diet may be an effective non-pharmacologic adjuvant therapy for certain types of cancer, the paper concluded.Ongoing researchMore studies are coming. In Gower's study, participants varied in cancer stage and treatment, which may have influenced the results. She is planning to follow up with a ketogenic diet study focused on ovarian cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, investigating immune function and survival.And the research team who published their mice findings in Nature are now carrying this research into a clinical trial for patients with lymphoma and endometrial cancers. The trial aims to include 40 patients and begin this fall.Cancer patients, survivors and what to eatAICR recommends that anyone who has received a diagnosis of cancer should receive specialized nutritional advice from an appropriately trained professional.For patients interested in Ketogenic diet, it is vitally important that you talk with your health-care providers, says Alice Bender, MS, RDN, AICR's Director of Nutrition Programs. ""A dietitian is best positioned to talk with you about what is known regarding the pros and cons – especially to learn if this diet has any research showing the reasonable application with your particular type of cancer and if the ketogenic diet may even be harmful for you.""The diet's strict limitation on starchy vegetables, whole grains, and fruits may lead to missing out on vitamins, minerals and other healthy compounds found in plant foods, which can lead to malnutrition, Bender adds. A true ketogenic diet could also lead to digestive and other unpleasant side effects. It requires monitoring and nutritional supplements. It can be difficult to follow.""Even for people who comply with the diet, the metabolic effects may vary and the effect on cancer treatment is still uncertain,"" Brockton warns.There is, however, clear evidence that following a diet rich in plant foods like vegetables, whole grains, fruit, and beans, choosing moderate amounts of red meat and other animal foods and limiting alcohol reduces the risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. It also provides the nutrition needed for overall health and wellness.AICR recommends that survivors who have finished their treatment follow the diet recommended for cancer prevention, unless otherwise advised. That means a diet filled with a variety of plant foods, including whole grains, vegetables, and fruit, with healthy proteins and limited amounts of red meat and highly processed, fatty and sugary foods.For the latest news on lifestyle and cancer survivors' health, sign up for AICR's free monthly Recharge.Author: Mya NelsonMya R.

How's Your Blood Sugar? 15 Signs That You Have Insulin Resistance,"by Dr. Will ColeA staggering 50 percent of us are now either prediabetic or have full-blown type 2 diabetes. No, that is not a typo; one out of two of us have some serious blood sugar problems, making a condition that was once a rarity completely commonplace.Much of the blood sugar problems we see today are due to one thing: insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone that directs blood sugar into cells to create energy in the form of ATP, but when you become resistant to its effects, your cell receptor sites are blunted and you're left with a backup of insulin and blood sugar, which is no bueno. If this condition goes on for too long without intervention, you could get diabetes, which is one of the leading causes of heart attacks and strokes!Know the signs of blood sugar imbalanceIf more than one of these is true for you, I suggest getting your blood sugar levels checked stat.You crave sweets or breads and pastries….a lot!Eating sweets doesn't relieve your sugar cravings and even increases them.You become irritable and ""hangry"" if you miss a meal.You find yourself needing caffeine to get through the day.You become lightheaded if you miss a meal.Eating makes you exhausted and in need of a nap.It's difficult for you to lose weight.You feel weak, shaky, or jittery pretty frequently.You have to pee a lot.You get agitated, easily upset, or nervous, out of proportion to the reason for these feelings.Your memory is not what it used to be.Your vision is blurry.Your waist measurement is equal to or larger than your hip measurements.You have an atypically low sex drive.You're always thirsty.Natural ways to improve blood sugar balanceYou don't have to settle for a future of diabetes. Intervene now with these tips for restoring a healthy blood sugar/insulin balance.1. Find your baseline.The labs I run on my patients to assess their blood sugar balance and check for insulin resistance are:Serum insulin: Optimal Range: &lt; 3 ulU/mLC-peptide: Optimal Range: 0.8 to 3.1 ng/mLFasting blood sugar: Optimal Range: 75 to 90 mg/dLHgb A1C: Optimal Range: &lt; 5.3 percentTriglycerides: Optimal Range: &lt; 100 mg/dLHDL: Optimal Range: 59 to 100 mg/dL2. Sip on matcha.EGCG is a compound in green tea, EGCG has demonstrated a stabilizing effect on blood sugar levels. Drinking the whole green tea leaf in the form of matcha powder is a great way to up your ECGC intake.3. Try alpha-lipoic acid.In several studies, alpha-lipoic acid supplements helped balance blood sugar levels and improved insulin resistance. This antioxidant also strengthens immunity, improves energy production in cells, protects brain cells against excitotoxicity, and helps the body remove excess toxic metals. For blood sugar control, take 200 milligrams three times a day.4. Take magnesium.According to research published in the medical journal Circulation, in a group of nearly 5,000 people, those who took higher levels of magnesium over a period of 15 years had a decreased risk of metabolic syndrome, a condition that is often a precursor to diabetes. A similar study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, followed more than 1,000 healthy adults for five years and found that greater magnesium intake improved insulin sensitivity. Other studies have shown that magnesium improves triglycerides and high blood pressure – two other hallmarks of metabolic syndrome and diabetes.5. Add chromium.When chromium levels are low, good cholesterol tends to drop and the risk of insulin resistance, as well as triglyceride levels, go up. Chromium supplementation has been shown to improve blood sugar receptor function. The best food sources of chromium include onions, tomatoes, potatoes, and sea vegetables.6. Increase Nrf-2.The protein Nrf-2 plays a role in regulating antioxidant gene induction by turning on genes that are responsible for antioxidant and detox pathways. When Nrf-2 is activated, inflammation tends to subside. There are many antioxidant rich foods that tend to activate Nrf-2, including:EGCG from green teaQuercetin from applesCurcumin from turmericResveratrol from grapesRosmarinic acid from rosemaryL-sulforaphane from broccoliThiosulfonateallicin from garlic7. Bring in vitamin E.This fat-soluble tocopherol has been shown to support insulin sensitivity. Standard doses range between 600 and 900 milligrams.8. Sprinkle cinnamon.Proanthocyanidin, a bioflavonoid found in cinnamon, may alter the insulin-signaling activity in fat cells, making it a potential diabetes buster. The spice has also been shown to significantly reduce blood sugar levels and triglycerides in people with type 2 diabetes.9. Seal and heal the gut.Your gut health and blood sugar balance are inextricably connected – one study found that transplanting the microbiome of diabetic mice into healthy mice made the recipients diabetic! Among the culprits are advanced glycation end products (AGE) – harmful compounds that have the potential to cause leaky gut. A high sugar diet can also tip your microbiome in the wrong direction, causing candida overgrowth, which is also linked to blood sugar problems. What's good for your gut is good for your blood sugar, and vice versa.10. Get more sun.Most people have low vitamin D levels, which can cause a host of problems, but in one study, supplementing with vitamin D for 12 weeks decreased body fat by 7 percent, and lower weight correlates with better blood sugar control. Low D levels have also been linked to metabolic syndrome. Aim for 60 to 80 ng/mL per day.11. Eat more healthy fats.One study found that higher blood sugar in non-diabetics decreased function in areas of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is one reason why Alzheimer's is often referred to in the medical literature as ""type 3 diabetes."" On the other hand, a ketogenic diet – where fat, not sugar, is your primary source of energy – has been shown to do some remarkable things for your brain health.Healthy fats provide a slow, sustainable form of energy, subverting the more drastic ups and downs that can happen with sugar burning. Humans were meant to rely more on fat and less on sugar – for example, babies primarily use the fat in breast milk for brain development and energy. From a biological and evolutionary perspective, the most sustainable form of energy for optimal brain health as well as blood sugar control is healthy natural fat.12. Take B-vitamins for the win.Methylation is a complex process that supports many crucial function in the body, including healthy blood sugar balance. Activated B vitamins – like B9 L-Methylfolate (L-5-MTHF) and B6 Pyridoxyl-5-Phosphate (P5P) – are a great way to support methylation pathways. Food medicines to focus on are spinach, okra, and turnip greens, and meats like chicken liver or grass-fed beef liver, which have the highest levels of bioavailable B vitamins.13. Activate your PPARs.Studies suggest that PPARs, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, may help improve inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis, asthma, colitis, MS, and other autoimmune conditions. Some PPAR activators for you to bring into your life: wild-caught fish, green tea, astragalus, ginger, and sea buckthorn.14. Get your omega-3s on.You've probably heard that omega-3 fatty acids can lower the risk of stroke and heart attacks, but these healthy fats most prevalent in fish oil also convert the potentially harmful very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are linked to diabetes, into less dangerous low-density lipoproteins (LDL).15. Never forget adaptogens!Adaptogens are awesome at balancing out hormones and inflammation. A study found the adaptogen American ginseng berry juice could significantly improve glucose tolerance and normal bloods sugar levels after just 10 days.If you want to learn more about your own health case please check out our free health evaluation.

"Breakfast Removes Cholesterol, Blood Sugar And Weight","The breakfast is the most important meal in the day, and should never be skipped.There are many people who believe that they support their health by omitting breakfast, and according to the Association of UK Dieticians (BDA), only two-thirds of adults in the UK eat breakfast regularly, and around three-quarters of Americans.Some maintain that the importance of this first meal in the day is wisely included in its name: we're advised to eat it to break our overnight fast.According to dietician Sarah Elder, the body uses a lot of energy stores for growth and repair through the night, so a balanced breakfast helps to boost the energy levels, as well as the amounts of protein and calcium used throughout the night.It energizes the body, improves concentration, and helps the body to burn calories. Studies have shown that breakfast is linked to improved memory, and a lower risk of heart disease, obesity, disease, and high cholesterol. When we skip breakfast, we experience increased cravings as the sugar levels in the body are low, and we end up overeating during the rest of the day. The following breakfast recipe is a healthy option to start the day. It will support the calorie-burning process, lower cholesterol and glucose levels, and help you lose excess weight. Its main ingredients are oats and chia seeds. Chia seeds are abundant in omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, and the powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties improve heart health and fight arthritis, and diverticulosis.

Consortium aims to study link between childhood blood sugar levels and mid-life brain health,"A consortium of Louisiana scientists from LSU's Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Tulane University and Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center aims to discover how blood sugar levels early in life contribute to a person's brain health in middle age.These results could lead to new blood sugar management guidelines for children and help prevent late-life cognitive decline - a condition for which there is no effective treatment.""The Bogalusa Heart Study is one of the longest, ongoing studies of a biracial, semi-rural community in the South. It is the only study that collected assessments of the community members' metabolic status from early childhood through mid-life,"" says Dr. Owen Carmichael, co-principal investigator and director of Pennington Biomedical's Biomedical Imaging Center. ""This study will add measurements of brain health as well as cognitive performance in midlife.""Carmichael and colleagues will use Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to assess brain health in study participants.In addition to being a treatment center for cancer, Mary Bird Perkins has unique expertise with imaging technologies that can also permit assessment of brain health. Approximately 200 Bogalusa Heart Study volunteers will receive PET scans at the Mary Bird Perkins facility in Hammond, according to Jonas Fontenot, PhD, Chief Operating Officer and Chief of Physics at Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center and study co-investigator.""We are excited to play a role by offering advanced imaging services for this important research,"" says Dr. Fontenot. ""This is a collaboration that we hope will inform future healthcare decisions and impact prevention of disease. As an organization, we continue to seek ways to advance medicine and work with likeminded institutions dedicated to enhancing healthcare in Louisiana.""""This imaging data will be linked to the same participants' blood glucose levels from their childhood years in the Bogalusa Heart Study,"" adds Tulane University's co-Principal Investigator Lydia Bazzano, MD, PhD.Biostatistical tests will then be used to determine if any relationship exists between the blood sugar levels the volunteers experienced in childhood and brain health markers--including Alzheimer's disease markers--measured via PET and MRI in midlife.The study is officially titled ""Early Life Glycemic Status and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Markers in Middle Age: The Bogalusa Heart Study."" The short version of the title is The Bogalusa Heart Study - Brain 2 or BHS - Brain 2. The study is expected to begin recruitment on May 15.",https://t.co/rkEjTGi8wr,news

What's the Best Natural Treatment for Depression?,"It seems that depression is in the headlines more and more these days. The World Health Organization says that there are over 300 million people in the world who have been struggling with depression. That's an 18% increase between 2005 and 2015. And this makes people out there search the world wide web think: what's the best treatment for depression?We would often hear about famous people who are or have been struggling with depression. Celebrities such as Beyonce, Adele, Dolly Parton, and Brooke Shields have opened up about their battle with depression. And they all described their experience as something that brought them pain, trauma, and shame.Fortunately, most have finally recovered from it. Others are not so lucky. Perhaps we have heard about people with severe depression resorting to suicide. And yes, even the most successful, talented individuals cannot escape. Take for example ""successful"" personalities like Kurt Cobain or Marilyn Monroe. Even the funniest guy in the world, Robin Williams, can fall victim.But yes, it happens.However, despite the number of people who have been affected by it as well as the alarming increase every year, most people choose to ignore or not seek medical help. Why? Because of the stigma attached to depression.What is the stigma attached to depression?Lewis Wolpert, a depression patient himself, wrote a paper called ""Stigma of Depression – A Personal View"" which was published in British Medical Bulletin. And he wrote:""Depression is a serious illness of which I and other patients should not be ashamed but this is hard to avoid. The stigma of depression is different from that of other mental illnesses and largely due to the negative nature of the illness that makes depressives seem unattractive and unreliable. Self stigmatisation makes patients shameful and secretive and can prevent proper treatment.""Stigma may also cause somatic symptoms as it is more acceptable to talk of stomach ache and fatigue than mental problems. A major contributing factor is that depression for those who have not had it is very hard to understand and so can be seen as a sign of weakness. Openness by depressives and education in schools could help.""Indeed this stigma is alive even today when most people have become more open to talking about mental illness.If you are someone who has been through depression, you will probably agree that sometimes, it is more convenient to just hide your depression and pretend that everything's okay. Why? Because people who haven't experienced depression cannot really understand what's going on with a depressed individual. When you're outside looking in, it is really hard to comprehend depression and its effects. That's why people who haven't experienced depression would often say, ""That person is just weak."" Or ""His mental capacity simply cannot handle life.""What can be done to reduce the stigma of depression?According to Wolpert, there is no easy way to reduce the stigma of depression. He even admits that acutely ill depressives are not attractive company. But he said spreading awareness about this disease can be the key: ""Perhaps the most important aim would be to publicise just how wide-spread depression is and that it is a serious illness. Most important is that it can be cured. It could help a great deal if those individuals with depression who are well known public figures were to support such a campaign.""And we agree to this. Public figures can surely help spread awareness. Read our article on Celebrities Who Have Become Mental Health Advocates.What is Depression?If you are a person suffering from depression, it is very important to understand that what you're going through is not something you're experiencing because you're weak. Instead, it is a mental health issue which definitely has a cure.If you haven't experienced depression, understanding depression and anxiety is your first step, you will need to understand before you will know how to help those people who are struggling with depression.WebMD listed signs of clinical depression. And this can include:Trouble concentrating, remembering details, and making decisionsFatigueFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, and helplessnessPessimism and hopelessnessInsomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or sleeping too muchIrritabilityRestlessnessLoss of interest in things once pleasurable, including sexOvereating, or appetite lossAches, pains, headaches, or cramps that won't go awayDigestive problems that don't get better, even with treatmentPersistent sad, anxious, or ""empty"" feelingsSuicidal thoughts or attemptsWhat Causes Depression?For a long time, doctors have told us that the cause of depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain. It has been advertised that depression occurs when the happy chemical called serotonin is absent and that depression can be cured by taking a prescription drug or antidepressant … the most popular ones being Prozac and Zoloft.And most Americans who have struggled with depression have done just that. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in 10 Americans aged 12 and over take antidepressant medication. Females are more likely to take antidepressants than males.However, recent studies are pointing to a new direction especially that according to recent studies, antidepressants don't work most of the time.This is supported by a 2009 review article by psychiatrist, Michael Gaitlin of the University of California, Los Angeles, as cited in Scientific American, which reported that one-third of people who are taking antidepressants are NOT showing any signs of improvement. A significant number, though, somehow got a little better in the short term after taking anti-depressants but still remain depressed.And this means one thing: ""If antidepressants correct a chemical imbalance that underlies depression, all or most depressed people should get better after taking them. That they do not suggests that we have only barely begun to understand the disorder at a molecular level.""Matthew J. Edlund M.D. wrote in Psychology Today:""Depression is a systemic, whole body illness — its causes are multiple, its manifestions endless, and its treatment multi-faceted. As Jonathan Himmelhoch and others have argued, depression represents an overall failure of the human body to adapt.""Similarly, Dr. Kelly Brogan, a holistic psychiatrist says that depression is often ""an inflammatory condition, a manifestation of irregularities in the body that can start far away from the brain and are not associated with the simplistic model of so-called 'chemical imbalances'."" What's more, she says that depression is an opportunity. ""It is a sign for us to stop and figure out what's causing our imbalance.""Scientific American agrees with this concept. It suggests considering other non-chemical leads as a form of treatment for depression. These are probably the best treatment for depression.Since antidepressants are not working as best as they ought to be, here are some of the best natural treatments for depression according to Psychology Today and WebMD: Get into a routineWhen you're depressed, you'll have a tendency to lose the structure in your life and therefore, you will feel lost or mixed up. Establishing a daily routine by scheduling your activities daily will somehow help you go back on track.Get enough sleepLack of sleep can worsen your depression, so try to get as much sleep as your body normally requires. If you find it hard to sleep, perhaps you want to consider changing your lifestyle.Set goalsWhen you're depressed, negativity can eat you up and make you feel like you won't be able to accomplish anything. What you can do is try to set certain goals. Don't be too hard on yourself and aim for something that's out of your comfort zone. Start with very simple things which are achievable.ExerciseWhen you exercise, your body is more likely to produce endorphins which makes you feel happier. These act as natural anti-depressants, so the more you move, the happier you'll become. You can try simple exercise like running or walking.Don't skip a mealMissing a meal will lower your blood sugar level, so you need to make sure not to skip a meal. Eating on time will stabilize your blood sugar level which will then reduce your mood swings.The Real Cause of Depression and What's the Best Natural Treatment for DepressionAgain, let us stress the new findings from research that depression is not caused simply by the presence or absence of certain chemicals in the brain. Depression is more complex than that. Harvard Health says that there are several possible causes of depression including ""faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, and medical problems."" Research says that depression comes about when several of these forces interact with each other.So, what's the best treatment for depression? Our advice for you is to take our happiness classes which are offered at the Delta Discovery Center. We understand that the same things that create happiness will lift depression, and we have programs to achieve this.

Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?,"Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Raspberries are a delicious fruit that has been widely consumed for thousands of years. They are packed full of vitamins, minerals, and powerful antioxidants that may help prevent disease and promote health. Various studies have shown that the fruit holds a plethora of health benefits, ranging from improving cardiovascular health to preventing cancer. Raspberries are also found to be beneficial in preventing as well as managing type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that the fruit may also aid weight loss.Type 2 diabetes is a chronic health condition that causes the level of blood sugar (glucose) to rise. Over time, high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, can affect your health from head to toe, resulting in a number of complications, including heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, eye damage, etc. By keeping your blood sugar under control, you can avoid all these health problems. Eating a diet high in fibre can help keep blood sugar level stable. Raspberries boast of many nutrients, including fibre, despite being low in calories, making them a great food for diabetics.How can raspberries help prevent or treat type 2 diabetes?Previous studies have shown that consuming a high-fibre diet can help improve blood glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in type 2 diabetes. Two new studies, published in Obesity and Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, suggested that eating raspberries can significantly help prevent and manage diabetes.The first study, which investigated people with 'pre-diabetes' and insulin resistance, found that eating raspberries for breakfast can help reduce glucose levels two hours later. Likewise, the second study reported that eating berries were associated with lower blood sugar levels. The results from these trials suggested that raspberry consumption could be an important dietary component for people at risk of type-2 diabetes.Also, one study found that red raspberries have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolism-stabilising properties, all of which can help reduce the risk of several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study conducted at the Centre for Nutrition Research, Institute for Food Safety and Health, Illinois Institute of Technology, also found that red raspberries contain components that can also reduce heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, the two common complications of diabetes. The research was published in Advances in Nutrition.Other health benefits of raspberriesStudies have shown that fibre and water content in raspberries may help prevent and treat constipation, aiding in maintaining a healthy digestive tract. It's worth noting that increasing fibre intake has also been linked to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as boost weight loss.The bottom line is that eating low-calorie, high-nutrient foods like raspberries as part of a healthy diet may help manage diabetes, support weight loss, and boost health. Just ensure that the fruit you bought is organic to reduce your risk of exposure to pesticides.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

I am also happy that he has decided to make this palette a staple, as I know I will be hitting pan and I never hit pan on any other palettes, this one will still continue to intrigue me and the coordinating shades are endless on how to put them together. This palette also can be used in conjunction of other palettes you may already have, none of the shades are out there, they just pair beautifully. So happy Beautylish offered this one, and I am glad they have the whole line.

Risk Of Gestational Diabetes Determined 7 Years Before Pregnancy,"The risk of gestational diabetes can be determined up to 7 years before pregnancy based on assessing measures of body weight and blood sugar routinely.580 ethnically diversified women participated in the study and women who experienced gestational diabetes while pregnant were compared to those who didn't have gestational diabetes. It was found that the risk of gestational diabetes increased directly with the amount of undesirable risk factors typically connected with heart disease and diabetes that were present before pregnancy, such as hypertension, high blood sugar, and overweight. They also found that undesirable levels of body weight and blood sugar were linked to a 4.6 times increased risk of gestational diabetes, in comparison to women having normal levels.[1]Previous research has revealed that women developing gestational diabetes while pregnant are more inclined to suffer from Type 2 diabetes following pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is characterized by glucose intolerance which usually takes place during the 2nd or 3rd trimester and results in complications in as many as 7% of pregnancies in the US. It can result in early delivery and Cesareans, and increases risk of the baby developing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disease later on in life.The research suggests that cardio-metabolic risk profile for factors regularly evaluated at clinical visits could help physicians in identifying high-risk women for early gestational diabetes management.Even though the established gestational diabetes risk factors are obesity, older maternal age, non-white ethnicity/race, a diabetes family history, and having previously given birth to a really large baby, these risk factors are lacking in as many as 50% of women that experience gestational diabetes. A better knowledge of gestational diabetes pre-pregnancy predictors could help in identifying women at risk and before becoming pregnant, and initiate intervention programs for preventing gestational diabetes and its related risks.",https://t.co/qwJBGRj39c,news
Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?,"Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Raspberries are a delicious fruit that has been widely consumed for thousands of years. They are packed full of vitamins, minerals, and powerful antioxidants that may help prevent disease and promote health. Various studies have shown that the fruit holds a plethora of health benefits, ranging from improving cardiovascular health to preventing cancer. Raspberries are also found to be beneficial in preventing as well as managing type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that the fruit may also aid weight loss.Type 2 diabetes is a chronic health condition that causes the level of blood sugar (glucose) to rise. Over time, high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, can affect your health from head to toe, resulting in a number of complications, including heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, eye damage, etc. By keeping your blood sugar under control, you can avoid all these health problems. Eating a diet high in fibre can help keep blood sugar level stable. Raspberries boast of many nutrients, including fibre, despite being low in calories, making them a great food for diabetics.How can raspberries help prevent or treat type 2 diabetes?Previous studies have shown that consuming a high-fibre diet can help improve blood glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in type 2 diabetes. Two new studies, published in Obesity and Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, suggested that eating raspberries can significantly help prevent and manage diabetes.The first study, which investigated people with 'pre-diabetes' and insulin resistance, found that eating raspberries for breakfast can help reduce glucose levels two hours later. Likewise, the second study reported that eating berries were associated with lower blood sugar levels. The results from these trials suggested that raspberry consumption could be an important dietary component for people at risk of type-2 diabetes.Also, one study found that red raspberries have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolism-stabilising properties, all of which can help reduce the risk of several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study conducted at the Centre for Nutrition Research, Institute for Food Safety and Health, Illinois Institute of Technology, also found that red raspberries contain components that can also reduce heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, the two common complications of diabetes. The research was published in Advances in Nutrition.Other health benefits of raspberriesStudies have shown that fibre and water content in raspberries may help prevent and treat constipation, aiding in maintaining a healthy digestive tract. It's worth noting that increasing fibre intake has also been linked to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as boost weight loss.The bottom line is that eating low-calorie, high-nutrient foods like raspberries as part of a healthy diet may help manage diabetes, support weight loss, and boost health. Just ensure that the fruit you bought is organic to reduce your risk of exposure to pesticides.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Sotagliflozin and blood sugar control in patients with type 1 diabetes,"Posted by Medivizor on Mar 22, 2019 in Diabetes mellitus | In a nutshell The aim of this study was to examine the effects of sotagliflozin added to insulin on blood sugar levels in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The main finding of the study was that sotagliflozin and insulin together improved blood sugar control in T1D.Some background The main treatment of T1D is insulin (the hormone that controls blood sugar levels). However, the side effects of insulin are weight gain and hypoglycemia (blood sugar going dangerously low). Therefore, it is difficult to maintain a balance between blood sugars going too high and too low. It is now suggested that adding other drugs to the treatment of T1D may improve blood sugar control, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is defined as a blood sugar level of less than 3.9 mmol/L.Sotagliflozin is a drug used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is an SGLT-2 inhibitor. It works by preventing sugar from being taken back up into the body after it is filtered out of the blood in the kidney. Instead, the sugar is removed from the body in the urine. Recent studies have shown that sotagliflozin has improved the HbA1c (blood test measuring blood sugar levels over the past 3 months), lowered fasting blood sugar levels and helped with weight loss in T1D. Blood sugar target range is 3.9-10.0 mmol/L.It is not known if a combination of sotagliflozin and insulin could improve the time spent in the target range (TIR), reduce hypoglycemia and reduce after-meal blood sugar levels in T1D.Methods &amp; findings This study included 278 patients with T1D who were treated with insulin. Patients were randomized to receive either 200mg sotagliflozin, 400mg sotagliflozin or a placebo daily. Patients were treated for 24 weeks.After 24 weeks, average TIR for patients treated with 400mg sotagliflozin was 64.2%. Average TIR for patients treated with 200mg sotagliflozin was 57.8% and patients treated with placebo had an average TIR of 51.6%.Patients treated with both 400mg and 200 mg sotagliflozin spent, on average, 5.5% of the time with a blood sugar less than 3.9mmol/L, compared to 5.9% of the time in the placebo group. After-meal blood sugar levels were reduced by 1.9 in those treated with 200mg sotagliflozin and 2.8 in those treated with 400mg sotagliflozin compared to the placebo group.The bottom line The authors concluded that sotagliflozin and insulin combined increased time spent in blood sugar target range and reduced after-meal blood sugar levels, without increasing time spent with a blood sugar of less than 3.9mmol/L.The fine print This study was funded and conducted by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sanofi, the developers of sotagliflozin.Published By :Diabetes CareOriginal Title :Improved Time in Range and Glycemic Variability With Sotagliflozin in Combination With Insulin in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: A Pooled Analysis of 24-Week Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data From the inTandem Program.

Diabetes: What you should eat to keep your blood sugar level in control,"Diabetes in a major cause of blindness, stroke, and even kidney failure. (Photo: Thinkstock)According to the World Health Organisation, over 100 million people in the world are diagnosed with diabetes because of unhealthy eating habits, improper diet, stress, and obesity. A major cause of blindness, diabetes can also lead to stroke, kidney failure, heart attacks, and lower limb amputation.Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose, so that it can be transformed into energy for various activities. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes the hormone insulin to help glucose enter the cells of our body. However, if a person has diabetes the body either does not produce enough insulin or cannot use the insulin produced.""The Glycemic Index, or GI, measures how a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose. Food low in GI is good for maintaining the blood glucose level,"" says dietitian Jasleen Kaur, founder and mentor, Just Diet Clinic.She adds that since black beans are low in GI, they are called the super food in diabetes. Black beans, with a GI level of less than 55, helps maintain the blood glucose levels. Some other foods with low GI levels are oatmeal, oat bran, muesli, bran, peas, and legumes,"" she says while sharing a few things people suffering from diabetes should and should not do, and the foods they should consume to maintain their blood sugar levels.What to eat to maintain your blood sugar levels:Karela juice is extremely beneficial for diabetics.

Statins raise diabetes risk; what to do instead of drugs,"You've been told you need to lower your cholesterol, but did you know taking a statin could raise your risk of type 2 diabetes? A recent study of almost 9,000 people in their 60s showed that statin use increased the risk of diabetes by almost 40 percent. Statin use was also associated with a higher risk for elevated blood sugar and insulin resistance (pre-diabetes). While the brand of statin subjects took didn't seem to matter, risk was higher in overweight and obese subjects.Given the risks associated with high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and diabetes, this study highlights further problems with statin use for a condition that is typically well managed through functional medicine protocols. High blood sugar and diabetes raise your risk for many chronic health disorders, including dementia and Alzheimer's.This isn't the first study to link statins with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Previous research has found a 50 percent increased risk of diabetes in female users.Statins most commonly prescribed drugsStatins are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, accounting for more than $20 billion of spending a year. About one in four Americans over 40 takes statins, with that number having increased by almost 80 percent in the last two decades. Side effects include muscle weakness and wasting, headaches, difficulty sleeping, and dizziness.Statins do not address the underlying cause of high cholesterolAlthough statins lower cholesterol, they do not address the underlying cause of high cholesterol in most people, which is typically inflammation (some people have a genetic disorder that causes very high cholesterol). The body uses cholesterol to patch up damage in the arteries caused by inflammation. In fact, research shows inflammation is the primary cause of heart attacks and strokes, not high cholesterol.Considering the following facts about cholesterol and heart disease:75 percent of people who have heart attacks have normal cholesterol.Older patients with low cholesterol have a higher risk of death than those with higher cholesterol.Populations in other countries with higher cholesterol than Americans have less heart disease.Hypothyroidism, a condition estimated to affect more than 20 million Americans, raises cholesterol. Many find a gluten-free diet lowers cholesterol, as gluten is inflammatory for so many people.Research also shows diets low in fat and high in carbohydrates increase the ""bad"" form of LDL (there are two to look at) and decrease the protective HDL.Lowering cholesterol through functional medicineUsing functional medicine is a highly effective way to lower cholesterol naturally. This is because functional medicine identifies and manages the root cause of a problem versus using a drug to block symptoms.Management includes an anti-inflammatory diet, exercise, nutritional support, and finding out causes of inflammation. These may include low thyroid function, autoimmune disease, bacterial or viral infections, leaky gut, poor blood-sugar handling, or other chronic health issues.In fact, high cholesterol is more often tied to a diet too high processed carbohydrates and sugars, not fat. Sugar and refined carbs, including processed white foods, drive good cholesterol down and triglycerides up. It causes low density small particles that encourage the dangerous buildup of arterial plaque. This can lead to not only heart disease but also insulin resistance or ""pre-diabetes."" Sugar, not dietary fat, is the bigger cause of most heart attacks.However, the type of fat you eat matters too. Trans fats, or hydrogenated fats, promote dangerous types of cholesterol, while omega-3 fats and monounsaturated fats improve the healthy types of cholesterol.Measuring cholesterol playersCholesterol is found in every cell and helps produce cell membranes, vitamin D, and hormones. It's also necessary for good neurological function.When we measure cholesterol, we are measuring LDL and HDL. These are small packages of fat and protein that help move cholesterol throughout the body.High-density lipoprotein — HDLThis is considered ""good"" cholesterol. It helps removes excess arterial plaque.Low-density lipoprotein — LDLThis is considered ""bad"" cholesterol. It can form plaque that narrows the arteries and makes them less flexible (atherosclerosis).TriglyceridesHigh levels of this dangerous fat are linked to heart disease and diabetes. Levels rise from eating too many sugars and processed carbs, as well as from smoking, physical inactivity, excessive drinking and being overweight.Lipoprotein (a) or Lp(a)Lp(a) is made up of an LDL part plus a protein (apoprotein a). Elevated Lp(a) levels are a strong risk for heart disease.When testing cholesterol, please pay attention to:Levels of HDL ""good"" cholesterol versus LDL ""bad"" cholesterolTriglyceride levelsThe ratio of triglycerides to HDLThe ratio of total cholesterol to HDLInflammation promotes heart diseaseSystemic inflammation is a primary factor in heart disease and most chronic health disorders. A diet high in sugars and processed carbs, a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, excessive drinking, chronic stress, gut infections, unmanaged autoimmunity, and chronic infections are all causes of chronic inflammation. People with elevated systemic inflammation, which is measured by a blood marker called C-reactive protein (CRP) have a higher risk for heart disease than those with high cholesterol. Also, normal cholesterol is not protective for those with high CRP.By addressing the cause of high cholesterol not only do you avoid the dangerous risks and unpleasant side effects of statins, but also you journey into your golden years with improved energy and well being.",https://t.co/2q9DKgaf4i,news
Keto and Fasting vs. Blood Sugar | Ketone Production | Glucose- Thomas DeLauer,"VIDEOPlease Subscribe for 3x Videos Per Week + Live Broadcastshttps://www.youtube.com/user/TheTdelauer?sub_confirmation=1To learn more, visit my website here: http://www.ThomasDeLauer.comGet the Apparel I Wear at http://www.Hylete.comKeto and Fasting vs. Blood Sugar | Ketone Production | Glucose- Thomas DeLauer…Prior to converting to the keto diet, your muscles were the major sites to soak up and use glucose in the blood for energy.On the long-term keto diet, however, they now prefer fat as fuel – so the muscles are resisting the action of insulin to bring sugar into cells for energy as they don't want or need sugar anymore, so they don't get absorbed.Hence, the slightly elevated, but generally stable, glucose circulating in the blood – the glucose coming from when you consume no sugar is due to gluconeogenesis.Why Does This Occur?There is no essential requirement for dietary carbs because humans possess the ability to adapt to low-carb availability.In the liver of a keto-adapted person, ketone production increases dramatically to displace glucose as the brain's primary energy source, while fatty acids supply the majority of energy for skeletal muscle.Glucose production from non-carb sources via gluconeogenesis supplies carbons for the few cells dependent on glycolysis. The majority of glucose is spared for tissues with an absolute requirement for it, such as the brain.So with muscle tissue ""refusing"" the glucose in order to keep it available for the brain, the blood glucose rises, especially first thing in the morning – due to the dawn phenomenon.When you are sleeping your body is very active cleaning out the brain and rebalancing hormones to prepare you for the next day.Early in the morning, the body releases cortisol, epinephrine, growth hormone, and glucagon – these hormones all have the effect of increasing blood sugar to wake you up.The difference in those who are following a ketogenic lifestyle is that if they are well keto-adapted, then their cells may refuse to burn that sugar for energy, which can make fasting blood sugar levels be more elevated than usual.Simply, dawn phenomenon is a natural rise in blood sugar because of a surge of hormones secreted at night which trigger your liver to dump sugar into your blood to help prepare you for the day.In Depth:So physiological insulin resistance is actually quite logical as muscle runs well on lipids and so glucose can be left for tissues such as brain, which really need it.Neuronal tissue varies in its use of insulin to uptake glucose but doesn't accumulate lipid in the way muscle does, so physiological insulin resistance is not an issue for brain cells.However, while muscles are in ""refusal mode"" for glucose the least input, from food or gluconeogenesis, will rapidly spike blood glucose.Instead of sugar not being able to get into the cells due to insulin resistance, the cells are simply refusing to burn sugar because they would prefer the ketones already being used.So after going low carb, your muscle tissue becomes insulin resistant in order to preserve serum glucose availability for the brain.If your muscle tissue did not do this, reduced availability of glucose in the serum could (theoretically) put you in dire straights if your brain can't meet minimal demand for glucose. In other words, physiological insulin resistance is a protective response of the body that ensures that the brain gets the benefit of a limited supply of glucose.Because the rest of the body is refusing to take up glucose, and the liver takes it up slowly, a meal of carbohydrates is followed by higher blood glucose levels in someone on a low carbohydrate diet.http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/304/3/994.long1) physiology.org | Error.

Type 2 Diabetes Remission?,"Need help navigating life with diabetes? You can always Ask D'Mine!Welcome again to our weekly Q&amp;A column, hosted by veteran type 1 and diabetes author Wil Dubois. Today Wil is looking at international differences in the way diabetes is treated and discussed, and whether type 2 diabetes can really disappear...{Got your own questions? Email us at AskDMine@diabetesmine.com } Michael, type 2 from the UK, writes:I am a 57-year-old UK male, recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in March 2018. My A1C was 8.5%, my weight, 343 lbs. Since then, I have lost weight by reducing white carbs, calories, and by taking a brisk walk daily. I have had two further A1C test results -- August 2018: 5.9%, December 2018: 5.6%. My weight is now 231 lbs. I have been told that my diabetes is in remission. I have never taken meds for my diabetes. Can you tell me what you think is now happening in my body with regard to liver, blood vessels, pancreas function, insulin and blood glucose control? Wil@Ask D'Mine answers: Wow. Medicine sure is different on your side of the pond. But before I talk about that, and dig into your questions, let me take a moment to pin a medal on your chest. You're my Diabetes Hero of the Month. In fact, I think I'll just go head and give you the award for the whole year. You lost 112 pounds. In one year. That's a third of your original body weight. In one year. That's frickin' amazing! And the results of that effort are sure paying off in your A1C improvements. But did it place your diabetes in remission? Hmmmm…. OK. Here's the deal. Over here in the USA, ""remission"" is not a term we've really embraced for diabetes, for when it's seemingly stopped dead in its tracks by lifestyle change. Although we probably should. I like the term. It suggests the disease is currently a non-issue, but could come back. Instead, in State-side medical circles, we take the once-a-diabetic, always-a-diabetic approach. Patients with normalized blood sugar still carry a diabetes diagnosis with them. In fact, we don't even have a diagnosis code for diabetes in remission. On the other hand, and to the opposite extreme, among patients you often hear the notion of ""reversing"" diabetes. Diabetes can't be reversed. It can be slowed. It can be stopped where it is at. Blood sugars can be normalized, creating the illusion of reversal, but take away the damn you built across the river (by going back to your previous weight, eating, and exercise habits) and diabetes will come roaring back like flood waters. So, as I said, I like the word remission. And you Brits are actually the driving force for embracing the remission concept in diabetes, most notably with the recent DiRect Trial—which used weight management in primary care settings to treat diabetes and place it in ""remission."" I hope the term catches on more widely. Of course, in fairness, back in 2009, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) published a consensus paper that tried to create a medical definitions of both ""cure"" and ""remission."" In that paper the ADA established medical criteria for both partial remission and complete remission based on A1C and fasting glucose levels, and stipulated that those levels would have to be under the target levels for ""at least one year's duration in the absence of active pharmacologic therapy or ongoing procedures."" So under this rarely-used American definition of remission, you still haven't been ""clean"" long enough to qualify. Not that I have any doubt that you will. But word choice isn't the only thing about how your docs addressed your diabetes that's different from what I'm used to. Your diagnosis A1C was right on the border of causing serious complications, and yet your medical team choose not to start even one single medication. That blows my mind. Completely. Using the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) treatment algorithm over here, you would have left the doctor's office on at least two medications, and a good argument could have been made for starting insulin five minutes after your A1C test results came in.Hey, I'm not medicine-happy, but I have a healthy sense of urgency when it comes to diabetes and its destructive capabilities when out of control. I don't trust diabetes, and frankly, I don't trust diabetes patients, either.OK, that sounded bad. It didn't quite come out the way I intended.Here's the deal: I've worked with literally hundreds of perfectly lovely people who have begged me to intervene with their doctors not to start any sort of medicine, offering up promises of ridiculous degrees of lifestyle change to avoid meds. These people meant well. And they thought they could do it. But, hey, lifestyle change is tough. I used to say it's easier to change your gender than your diet, but that upset the trans-gender crowd. I honestly didn't mean to diss anyone or bruise anyone's feelings; rather I simply wanted to point out that for human beings, changing how we live is the hardest of all things. And I found through experience that we had better success when we medicated the tiger diabetes into submission, to ensure the patient's safety, and then instituted lifestyle changes, in baby steps—reducing the meds as success dictated. Of course, your docs took a different course when it came to starting meds, and they were proved correct in your case.So, what about complications? A year from now, when both your docs and the ADA agree that you're in remission, do you have a completely clean bill of health? Or is there permanent damage that can't be undone? One thing everyone agrees on is that normalizing blood sugar stops old complications from growing and new ones from appearing. So that's a good thing. But can any damage sustained from high blood sugars prior to remission improve? Can you return to the complete health you enjoyed prior to diabetes?That's controversial and not that well-researched yet. And it's complicated by the fact that there are a lot of variables at play. The best way to think about this issue is to compare it to a thermonuclear bomb. BOOM. The bomb goes off. Buildings are flattened in the blast wave. People die in the fireball. But it doesn't end there, does it?'Cause nukes have a side effect: Radiation. Some radiation accompanies the blast. Some drifts down in the fallout. And some permeates the blast site like some sort of evil mold that just can't be scrubbed away. So too, high sugar affects cells in your body the same way, and linked with this is another issue: Some of the tissues in your body deal with damage better than others. Some can grow back if damaged. Others don't seem to possess this same regenerative magic. And in sad point of fact, most complications—especially the big three — nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy — are historically viewed as being cast in stone. Whatever damage is done prior to the sugars being controlled is with you for the rest of your life, sometimes not manifesting until years after the damage occurs. Did you have diabetes long enough for damage to happen? Most likely so. By the time of diagnosis, most type 2s have already suffered tissue damage from elevated blood sugars due to the fact that T2 diabetes is preceded by a looooooong period of pre-diabetes in which sugars are above normal, pouring the foundations for complications.So where does that place us when it comes to your concerns in regard to liver, blood vessels, pancreas function, insulin and blood glucose control? At the moment, nothing new is happening. You sugar is now low enough that we can be pretty comfortable that there's no new damage taking place. Whether you've sustained any damage in the interim, and, if so, whether that damage might improve, is a bit more complicated.Starting with your liver: The main worry with the liver in T2 diabetes is fatty liver disease, which increases the risk of cirrhosis. Losing weight can fix the fatty part, but if cirrhosis has already started, that's a tougher issue. This type of liver damage can't be reversed—although like many other chronic conditions it can be treated, and isn't necessarily a death sentence. Next, on to your blood vessels... Looking at studies of bariatric surgery patients, the best baseline for diabetes remission, blood vessel complication outcomes appear to be a real crap shoot. Many patients show improvements in both kidney function and in eye-related complications, while on the other hand, others don't improve, and about a quarter—who had no complications prior to the procedure—develop microvascular complications in the five years following. This suggests a time-bomb like effect. What about the macrovascular complications? Initial evidence, also looking at bariatric surgery patients, suggests the same mixed bag.Lastly, what about the complex dance between your pancreas, insulin, and blood sugar?As a (former?) type 2, your body has been through a decades-long period of significant insulin resistance that led to your pancreas suffering some degree of burnout, ultimately leaving it unable to produce enough insulin to overcome the resistance, causing high blood sugar. Now that you've lost the weight, the insulin resistance is reduced and your insulin production is sufficient for you current needs. But has your pancreas recovered? I very much doubt that it has, or ever will. If you want to test that theory, eat a heavy dose of one of those white carbs you swore off and see what happens to your blood sugar. My bet is that you'll experience a significant spike.In active diabetes, insulin resistance gets worse over time, even when the diabetes is well-controlled. In pre-diabetes, when proactively addressed and ""reversed,"" the insulin resistance stabilizes and possibly improves. So what happens in remission? Will it stop advancing? Will it be frozen in place? Will dwindle and go away?I don't think anyone knows yet.But one thing is certain: You've changed your life for the better. You've stopped all the evils under your skin from hurting your further. That's wonderful. Will the sins of the past reap damage in the future? Possibly so. But it's equally possible that your cells will re-group. Heal. Grow. And uncomplicate your life completely. This is not a medical advice column. We are PWDs freely and openly sharing the wisdom of our collected experiences — our been-there-done-that knowledge from the trenches. But we are not MDs, RNs, NPs, PAs, CDEs (or partridges in pear trees). Bottom line: you still need the professional advice, treatment, and care of a licensed medical professional.",https://t.co/fIFiQEYQ3W,news
Can Eating Cheese Help Control Blood Sugar?,"Can Eating Cheese Help Control Blood Sugar? The body responds drastically to nutrients, energy consumption, levels of activity, stress and various states and stages of disease. Those that have type two diabetes are not able to secret the insulin that is required to properly respond to carbohydrates. They can, however, retain (and even increase) their ability to create insulin when responding to amino acid ingestion and proteins. Cows' milk is composed of three to four percent protein, which come from whey protein or casein.Cheese can help an individual obtain glucose levels that are within the healthy range. Even though cheese may be beneficial, those with sugar and insulin health issues need to consider the cheese's glycemic content. Glycemic content has it's foundations on how fast the body can digest the food's carbohydrates. Fortunately, most cheeses do not contain much, if any, carbohydrates so therefore, they rate lowly on the GI (glycemic index) scale. A cheese that is good for diabetics is provolone, and another one is parmesan. Provolone boasts the daily calcium value, while parmesan is higher in protein. It can contain eight grams of protein per serving while being low in calories. Even though fat content is important, a diabetic individual should also place attention to the salt content of the cheese. Cheeses with high salt include feta and halloumi. Cheeses that are in the lower sodium range include Wensleydale, cream cheese, low salt cottage cheese, and mozzarella. In some studies, it has been shown that cheese that is low fat and those that have regular fat have improved sensitivity of insulin in rats that were deemed pre-diabetic. The study was founded by the Dairy Farmers of Canada. The rats were given a diet that was high in fat for four weeks. This forced them to become pre-diabetic. Then the fats had Cheddar cheese or the same cheese, but low in fat and it was noticed that the risk of diabetes was lessened with cheese without affecting the production of insulin or the individual's body weight at a disproportionate level. For diabetics, it's important to take a balanced, healthy and responsible approach to cheese and cheese products when it comes to controlling sugar. It is wise to continue being mindful of saturated fats in foods, as people who had diabetes are usually at a higher risk of heart related health complications, such as heart-disease. Cheese, in those individuals who are not pre-diabetic or diabetic, can help reduce the chance of acquiring this particular health disorder.",https://t.co/8cjh2XbXZh,news
Consortium aims to study link between childhood blood sugar levels and mid-life brain health,"A consortium of Louisiana scientists from LSU's Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Tulane University and Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center aims to discover how blood sugar levels early in life contribute to a person's brain health in middle age.These results could lead to new blood sugar management guidelines for children and help prevent late-life cognitive decline - a condition for which there is no effective treatment.""The Bogalusa Heart Study is one of the longest, ongoing studies of a biracial, semi-rural community in the South. It is the only study that collected assessments of the community members' metabolic status from early childhood through mid-life,"" says Dr. Owen Carmichael, co-principal investigator and director of Pennington Biomedical's Biomedical Imaging Center. ""This study will add measurements of brain health as well as cognitive performance in midlife.""Carmichael and colleagues will use Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to assess brain health in study participants.In addition to being a treatment center for cancer, Mary Bird Perkins has unique expertise with imaging technologies that can also permit assessment of brain health. Approximately 200 Bogalusa Heart Study volunteers will receive PET scans at the Mary Bird Perkins facility in Hammond, according to Jonas Fontenot, PhD, Chief Operating Officer and Chief of Physics at Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center and study co-investigator.""We are excited to play a role by offering advanced imaging services for this important research,"" says Dr. Fontenot. ""This is a collaboration that we hope will inform future healthcare decisions and impact prevention of disease. As an organization, we continue to seek ways to advance medicine and work with likeminded institutions dedicated to enhancing healthcare in Louisiana.""""This imaging data will be linked to the same participants' blood glucose levels from their childhood years in the Bogalusa Heart Study,"" adds Tulane University's co-Principal Investigator Lydia Bazzano, MD, PhD.Biostatistical tests will then be used to determine if any relationship exists between the blood sugar levels the volunteers experienced in childhood and brain health markers--including Alzheimer's disease markers--measured via PET and MRI in midlife.The study is officially titled ""Early Life Glycemic Status and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Markers in Middle Age: The Bogalusa Heart Study."" The short version of the title is The Bogalusa Heart Study - Brain 2 or BHS - Brain 2. The study is expected to begin recruitment on May 15.",https://t.co/Uf0wVs3bGp,news
How Jeffree Star's Blood Sugar Led Me To Jehovah,"Believe it or not, I never used to wear makeup. It wasn't until I discovered YouTube makeup gurus that I ever even really attempted to wear it. That puts me somewhere in my thirties when I first tried, sloppily, to apply makeup properly without someone doing it for me. But once I did, I was hooked like your gran is to bingo.It's not that I felt I looked better or that it boosted my self-image because I care about what other people think of me as much as I do about the price of rubles, which is to say, not at all. It was more about the artistry. Before I ever discovered my first makeup guru, I thought it was a hollow pursuit and I, admittedly, felt people who wore it all the time were shallow and vain. It's true. I was a judgy prick back then.But when I watched my first makeup tutorial from the YouTube makeup OG, Michelle Phan, the heavens opened up, golden light poured down, muses appeared and they boomed in goldi-locked unison, ""behold, a new art form, you judgy prick"". I suddenly became aware of the fact that this was, without any shadow of a doubt, a delicate craft that took true skill and creativity. I was a changed human being.Now, ten years later, I'm a bona fide makeup addict. If I could spare the time, I'd spend hours a day just playing with it and creating new looks. Because I can't spare that much time, I often go out in experimental looks that I just messed around with that morning and I know, being the furthest thing from a pro, that I've probably horrified a few people here and there. There are probably days I've looked like a post-sex David Bowie or days I've rocked the ""I'm contagious"" look. I'm not afraid of colour, in fact, my most worn eyeliner is a vibrant purple because life only runs through the one time and really, it ought to be filled with as much purple as possible. Prince taught me that life lesson. Praise be.The point is, friendos, I loves me some makeup and I often watch makeup artists on YouTube while I cook and chow at lunchtime and one such artist I love to watch is Jeffree Star.I hear you gasping. Half of you are thinking, ""that racist piece of guano? WHY, GM, WHY?"".Yes, Jeffree has said some racist things in the past, but if you're up to date with your current Jeffree Star, you know he's turned his act right around and is now one of the most outspoken influencers in makeup when it comes to brands being inclusive. He's the first to call them out if their new lines of foundations or concealers don't have a diverse enough shade range and he will push the issue until it is addressed. He's a generous philanthropist, speaks openly about and owns up to his previous mistakes and is doing a great deal to make makeup accessible to and inclusive of everyone.If there's one quality I admire the most in people, it's the ability to change.He's also about the prettiest girl I've ever seen.With that said, he recently launched his new Blue Blood collection and I was completely blown away by the swatches people were doing of his Blue Blood eye palette. Not only was the packaging unlike anything I'd ever seen before, but the colours were so richly pigmented and blendable that I wanted… no, needed, to work with them. The problem is, I don't wear much blue. Being more of a pinks and reds and oranges type of mom, I decided I'd give Blood Sugar a try instead. The same quality and artistry went into his Blood Sugar collection, so I headed over to his web site to check it out.Of course, everything was sold out as it often is on his web site. And so began two weeks of poring over Jeffree's Twitter timeline for the announcement that Blood Sugar was back in stock. Every day, I'd reload the web page and every day it still said out of stock. Just when I was beginning to feel those luscious warm tones slip between my fingers, I saw it. Jeffree tweeted the date he'd be restocking this coveted palette. I set a reminder with Siri right then and doubled up with a Google reminder and when the day rolled around, I decided I wasn't going to sit on Twitter and wait for the tweet. Nope, eff that, I was just going to reload until I saw the item back in stock or my thumbs fell off, whichever came first.I saved my thumbs, kids and nerds, because two minutes before it was supposed to be restocked, there it was and I bought it faster than blood flows after a car model's nip slip at a show &amp; shine.I got the confirmation email and I was so excited. Really, that's an understatement. I'm not really a materialistic person. For flip's sake, my coffee table is still one I found being given away free on the side of the road 6 years ago, but I digress. Mama celebrated like a Catholic priest in the kiddie pool. Praise Jesus. Praise Horus. Praise the gods of makeup. I was about to lay my hands on Jeffree Star's Blood Sugar palette once and for all.Now, heathens, it was travelling from the United States of America. Los Angeles, California to be exact. That means, to this Canuck sitting in her igloo in the Great White North, that there was going to be a bit of a wait. I was prepared. I had already waited several weeks just to buy the dang thing, what was another week or two? I buckled in and found ways to distract myself as I used eyeshadow every day that I knew would never hold up to the Blood Sugar palette. I put it out of my mind until one day, I got a notification that the item had shipped.Bing Crosby in Heaven, the palette was on its way!Each stop it made, I got a text message letting me know. For some reason, it headed to Cincinnati but I was still going to love it despite its exposure to Bengals germs. It flew all the way back to the west coast where it crossed the border. My package cleared customs in Coquitlam and one morning I woke up to the text message that it was in the Kelowna DHL depot and could, at any moment, be placed on a truck for delivery.And then, a day before the package was scheduled to be delivered, and because God loves me, yes he does, I got the notification that it was out for delivery. Oh my lord Ganesh, nerd squad, I could almost feel it beneath my fingertips when I closed my eyes. If I could describe to you the beauty of the chorus of angels that rang out in my head, I certainly would.And so I waited. Every time I heard a truck drive by, my ears would perk and my eyes would widen like I was a meth head in the dark. But every time, I was let down. The package never arrived and as the day wore on, I was losing hope I would ever meet my new love. I began making dinner and preparing for the evening ""rush hour"" as we call it and after I'd sped through two or three hours straight of whirlwind busy-ness with kids and dogs and husbands and cats, I finally sat down to check the status on my phone again and it still said out for delivery.Dark fell on the Okanagan Valley and it was well past DHL's delivery hours but I still perked up every time I heard a truck. Alas, my palette never made it that day and I fell into a deep, disappointed slumber without it.The next morning, I arose more hopeful than a bloodhound at rib fest. I knew today was going to be the day I got to mess around with the most beautiful reds and pinks and purples I'd ever seen. I opened the window above my front door so I could hear if a truck pulled up and I swore I wasn't leaving the house until my package arrived. I got another notification that it was out for delivery and shivered with anticipation. I wrote a post for you guys, ears perked for any sound of deliveries. I scheduled social media posts, alert to every creak in the walls. Finally, as I began to answer emails, I heard a knock at the door.This was it, Courtney Goddamned Heard, it's go-time. I flew up from my chair and literally sprinted down the stairs skipping three with each step. My heart pounded as I rounded the corner to my front door and before it hit me that I hadn't heard a delivery truck, my door was flying open.Ladies and beards, let me tell you something. What was on the other side was not a gorgeous palette that was going to change my entire world. It wasn't a pink-wrapped collection of colours that made my heart flutter. There were no stars, no pink and no damned packages when I opened the door.No, friends, instead, there were a couple of goddamned Jehovah's Witnesses.Lord have mercy on my soul.Now, you all know me. I've written extensively about my horde of JWs who are determined to win my soul for Jeeboner. You know they used to visit me every week at my old house and you know I was on a first name basis with each of them. You know I'm kind to them, and often offer water or to come in for warmth and I am happy to talk to them about just about anything.You probably recall, as well, that one of my elderly witnesses who used to pop by my old house from time to time just disappeared. I never got a straight answer about where she'd gone, but I assumed, by her age, that she'd passed. She was always so lovely and I always felt so bad for her being out there in the cold and the snow and rain, or sometimes in the brutal heat of summer.The thing is, though, when I opened the door expecting to find the palette I'd been waiting so long for, I saw her.My missing witness. She wasn't dead, friends. She was alive and kicking and smiling.And, she remembered me!""You used to live in that house on the other street, didn't you?"" She asked. She further blew my mind when she followed it up with,""You have a little boy, don't you?""I mean, I never expected to be brought back down to earth by a couple of J-dubs, but here I was, all thoughts of makeup just melting away from my mind, so utterly happy to see this lady I'd worried about years prior.I told her I was so happy to see her and asked her where she'd been. She told me she had been caring for her mother. This woman on my doorstep looked like she was in her 80s and she had been caring for her mother. 107 years old, her mother had been. She passed in December and I told her I was so sorry to hear that.""Well, 107 years is a long, well-lived life, honey, so don't be sorry."" She replied with a genuine smile.I spoke with them for a few more minutes, reminded them I was an atheist, but I was happy to chat about God. We talked about the fact that the world is actually getting better, not worse (I even brought up Steven Pinker's Better Angels of Our Nature, because I never stop atheisting, bitches). We talked about the Bible a little and then we said our goodbyes. I walked back upstairs to my office with a huge grin on my face. My missing witness was still around.Sometime later, the doorbell rang and there was a palette on the other side. I mean, I was excited, but I hadn't thought about it again until it arrived. It's every bit as amazing as I thought it was going to be and worth every minute of the excruciating wait, but I gotta say, finding out my elderly witness friend is still out there living her life was way, way better.If you like what I do here and want to support my work, you can donate here or become a patron here.Image by me.

"Type 2 diabetes: Foods to lower blood sugar - nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits and legumes","Type 2 diabetes is a common condition in the UK that can be caused by eating a poor diet, high in saturated fat. Left untreated, it can lead to serious, long-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, as well as damage to the nerves, kidneys, eyes and feet. Eating a healthy diet can help manage a person's blood sugar level, and as part of this, eating foods from a certain food group is recommended.Some evidence has shown fibre can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes.A study published in 2018 suggests a high fibre diet can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 20 to 30 per cent.The research noted this effect came mainly from whole grains or insoluble cereal fibre.Other studies, however, have shown a combination of insoluble and soluble fibre in the diet can be beneficial.Soluble fibre absorbs water, turning it into a gel-like substance, while insoluble fibre doesn't.Four of the best sources of fibre you should consider adding to your diet are:Vegetables and fruitsNuts and seedsWhole grainsLegumesFibre is considered an essential part of the diet, particularly for a person with diabetes.Carbohydrates with high fibre take longer to digest than those in low fibre foods, reducing the chance of a blood sugar spike.Fibre also helps a person feel fuller for longer, making them less likely to overeat (being overweight is a risk factor for the condition developing).Government guidelines published in July 2015 say dietary fibre intake should be 30g a day, as part of a healthy balanced diet.But it was revealed most adults are only eating an average of about 18g a day.The NHS recommends the following ways to increase your fibre intake:Choose a higher-fibre breakfast cereal such as plain wholewheat biscuits (like Weetabix) or plain shredded whole grain (like Shredded wheat), or porridge as oats are also a good source of fibre.Go for wholemeal or granary breads, or higher fibre white bread, and choose wholegrains like wholewheat pasta, bulgur wheat or brown rice.Go for potatoes with their skins on, such as a baked potato or boiled new potatoes. Find out more about starchy foods and carbohydrates.Add pulses like beans, lentils or chickpeas to stews, curries and salads.Include plenty of vegetables with meals, either as a side dish or added to sauces, stews or curries.Have some fresh or dried fruit, or fruit canned in natural juice for dessert. Because dried fruit is sticky, it can increase the risk of tooth decay, so it's better if it is only eaten as part of a meal, rather than as a between-meal snack.For snacks, try fresh fruit, vegetable sticks, rye crackers, oatcakes and unsalted nuts or seeds.Some experts recommended certain supplements to control and prevent type 2 diabetes.",https://t.co/tQzESCfffS,news
Consortium aims to study link between childhood blood sugar levels and mid-life brain health,"A consortium of Louisiana scientists from LSU's Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Tulane University and Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center aims to discover how blood sugar levels early in life contribute to a person's brain health in middle age.These results could lead to new blood sugar management guidelines for children and help prevent late-life cognitive decline - a condition for which there is no effective treatment.""The Bogalusa Heart Study is one of the longest, ongoing studies of a biracial, semi-rural community in the South. It is the only study that collected assessments of the community members' metabolic status from early childhood through mid-life,"" says Dr. Owen Carmichael, co-principal investigator and director of Pennington Biomedical's Biomedical Imaging Center. ""This study will add measurements of brain health as well as cognitive performance in midlife.""Carmichael and colleagues will use Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to assess brain health in study participants.In addition to being a treatment center for cancer, Mary Bird Perkins has unique expertise with imaging technologies that can also permit assessment of brain health. Approximately 200 Bogalusa Heart Study volunteers will receive PET scans at the Mary Bird Perkins facility in Hammond, according to Jonas Fontenot, PhD, Chief Operating Officer and Chief of Physics at Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center and study co-investigator.""We are excited to play a role by offering advanced imaging services for this important research,"" says Dr. Fontenot. ""This is a collaboration that we hope will inform future healthcare decisions and impact prevention of disease. As an organization, we continue to seek ways to advance medicine and work with likeminded institutions dedicated to enhancing healthcare in Louisiana.""""This imaging data will be linked to the same participants' blood glucose levels from their childhood years in the Bogalusa Heart Study,"" adds Tulane University's co-Principal Investigator Lydia Bazzano, MD, PhD.Biostatistical tests will then be used to determine if any relationship exists between the blood sugar levels the volunteers experienced in childhood and brain health markers--including Alzheimer's disease markers--measured via PET and MRI in midlife.The study is officially titled ""Early Life Glycemic Status and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Markers in Middle Age: The Bogalusa Heart Study.""

Type-2 diabetes symptoms: Eat this to lower your blood sugar levels,"Type-2 diabetes is a common condition which causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to increase.According to the NHS, symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination and rapid weight loss.However, there are plenty of ways to reduce blood sugar levels, including what you eat and drink everyday.So what can add in your diet to help control type-2 diabetes? Many breads are high in carbohydrates which can raise blood sugar levels.But pumpernickel bread and 100% stone-ground wholewheat breads have low GI scores.GI stands for glycemic index and is a relative ranking of carbs in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.Pumpernickel and stone-ground whole wheat breads also have lower GI scores than regular whole wheat bread. ""Choosing wholegrain options makes sense""Diabetes UKFibre slows digestions and can help to stabilise blood sugar levels, which is good for type-2 diabetes sufferers.Diabetes UK said: ""Choosing wholegrain options makes sense.""They are high in fibre and keep you feeling fuller for longer than refined carbohydrates and take longer for the blood to break down so blood glucose levels do not 'spike' then drop rapidly.""But if you don't like pumpernickel bread, wholegrain, granary and rye bread are also recommended.Other carbohydrates include wholewheat or brown pasta and noodles, basmati or wild rice, porridge oats or muesli, and quinoa, burger wheat, couscous or yam.Are you worried about developing type-2 diabetes? It is advised to visit your local GP. TYPE-2 DIABETES: Symptoms include weight loss, frequent urination and extreme thirst (Pic: GETTY STOCK IMAGE) Alternatively, it is important to keep an eye on the following symptoms:1. Peeing more than usual, particularly at night2. Feeling thirsty all the time3. Feeling very tired4. Losing weight without trying to5.

Paleo Diet for Diabetics - Blood Sugar Management,"Paleo Diet for DiabeticsDieting as a diabetic is very important as food consumed has a direct linked effect on blood glucose levels. Paleo and Keto diet programs are among the best ways to manage blood sugar in diabetics. Some foods are known to either raise or decrease blood glucose levels in a rate unmatched by others. And as a result of this cause-effect scenario, an integral aspect of diabetes management and control is being aware of: What you eatHow much you eatPreparationThe eating plan you have in place that matches your schedule and lifestyleAll these factors should be taken into cognizance as a means of regulating and controlling blood sugar levels. Note that, the target range is a moderate level of blood glucose that is neither too high nor too low to present any side effect or health condition whatsoever.The focus in today's article is the Paleo Diet for diabetics and core analysis will revolve around:What paleo diet is?How paleo diet works?Paleo diet and its effect on diabetesThe research so far on Paleo dietBenefits and side effects of Paleo diet to diabeticsWhat is The Paleo Diet?Paleo diet is used to refer to the set and category of food ""Paleolithic Humans"" consumed depending on what was available to be gathered at the time and where they lived thus, referred to as the ""cave man diet"" which emphasizes the need for consumption of unprocessed animal, plant based, whole foods whilst shunning processed foods, dairy, sugars &amp; grains.The modern modifications to the Paleolithic diet stresses the need to eliminate unprocessed foods from ones eating plan. This results in a diet characterized by the consumption of relatively high mono/poly unsaturated healthy fats. Moderate animal protein and very low levels of carb intake as well.The strict paleo diet excludes the consumption of legumes (including lentils, beans etc). Grains (including wheat, rye, barley, bread and pasta etc). Hydrogenated or partly hydrogenated vegetable oils such as soybean, sunflower, corn, cotton seed, grape seed oil etc. Dairy products and sugars (including candy, ice cream etc).How The Paleo Diet WorksThe Paleo Diet consists of foods that are generally low in carbohydrate content. This leads to improved control of body Glycemic index. The diets focus is not on limiting the amount of calories consumed but its primary objective, the nutritional value of the foods eaten.The fundamentals of the Paleo Diet in relation to diabetes management include;Low Carbohydrates Intake:The diets principle revolve around limiting carbohydrate and keeping its intake at very minimal levels. This can present immeasurable health benefits to diabetics as it leads to lowering levels of blood sugar as carbs have the most impact on blood glucose.High Intake of Healthy Fats:It should be noted that this does not refer to the consumption of harmful trans or saturated fats but the intake of healthy mono and poly unsaturated fats that aid in reducing organ inflammation, promoting cardiovascular health and has direct linkage to ketosis: a metabolic state in which the body produces ketone bodies out of fat and utilizes these ketones as an alternative energy source instead of carbohydrate.Paleo Diet and its Effect on Diabetes, Blood Sugar and Insulin LevelsDue to the Paleolithic diets, food composition comprising mostly of low carbohydrate intake and healthy fat consumption, it leads to visible improvements in insulin sensitivity, glycemic index control, reduction in weight/waist and hip circumference and thus, automatically eliminating some of the predisposing risk factors of diabetes.ResearchA study by jönsson was the first to assess the potential benefits and effects the Paleolithic diet had on individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The study evaluated 13 subjects each with type 2 diabetes and placed on the diet for a period of 3 months each. At the end of the study, results indicated that the Paleolithic diet caused statistically significant lower mean values of blood pressure, body mass index, weight and hip circumference, triglycerides levels with decrease in fasting plasma glucose. The improvements were as a result of the diet promoting the consumption of whole unprocessed plant based foods with lesser bulk composition equating to the ""full feel"" on fewer calorie intake and thus, encouraging weight loss which is of benefit to individuals with type 2 diabetes.Another study published in 2015 showed that people with type 2 diabetes who followed the Paleolithic diet were able to;reduce cholesterol levels.lower blood pressure.stabilize blood sugar levels etc.Although there are no scientifically confirmed data as to how the Paleo diet effect this health changes, it is believed that it's increased fiber intake, decreased sugar &amp; processed food intake with more consumption of antioxidants &amp; micronutrient enriched foods had a healthier more positive impact on the guts microflora and in turn increasing their sensitivity to insulin.Paleo Diet Side Effects on DiabeticsThe side effects of Paleo diet is as a result of the exclusion of certain food groups with lowering of carb intake. This exclusion will result in certain side effects which are only temporary as the body adapts to change in eating plan. These include;Low Carbohydrate Flu:This include flu like symptoms due to the intake of low level carb a common characteristic of most Paleo diet. In such cases, there is less demand for insulin production from the liver and this decreases insulin secretion and improves insulin effect in minor quantity thus, reducing insulin resistance which is a major force of type 2 diabetes.Hypoglycemia (Low blood sugar):It is important to take precautions as a diabetic on insulin medication such as Sulfonylureas and Glinides. This combination with the Paleo diet can lead to extreme hypoglycemia due to the consumption of very low carbs. Be sure to adjust your insulin. Matching up dieting effects and prevent blood sugar from reaching harmful low levels.Other side effects include;Bad BreathLack of energyChange in Bowel HabitsIncreased CravingsConclusionThe paleo diet no doubt has its benefits and negative side effects regarding the management and treatment of diabetes. However, highly recommended to consult with a registered dietitian or licensed physician in order to closely monitor and examine factors that could render the diet ineffective or trigger certain symptoms.In the long run, choice of foods, how much of it consumed in terms of caloric value and amount is relative to blood glucose level.Data and research on paleo diet and its relation to diabetes &amp; weight loss is very minimal and most studies carried out engage only a small number of participants in a short study time frame (8 to 10 weeks or less) and thus, cannot be totally recommended as a sure certified guarantee of improvement to every individual.",https://t.co/oLETDkpbom,news

Type 2 diabetes: One snack proven to lower blood sugar and reduce risk of condition,"Type 2 diabetes is a condition where a person's blood sugar (glucose) level becomes too high. It can trigger symptoms such as excessive thirst, peeing more than usual and feeling very tired. Left untreated, it can lead to long-term complications with the eyes, nerves, kidneys and feet. A healthy diet can help manage blood sugar levels, in particular eating a wide range of foods, including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta, and keeping sugar, fat and salt to a minimum. Certain foods alone have also been found to have blood sugar lowering properties – one being walnuts.The nutty snack is hailed for its healthy fatty acids content and keeping the heart healthy.People with diabetes may have a higher risk of heart disease or stroke, so it's important they get fatty acids, like those found in walnuts, through diet.A study from 2018 suggested eating walnuts is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes. One of the most prominent characteristics of nuts for people with diabetes is their effect on cholesterol levels, according to Diabetes.co.uk.It explains: ""Avoiding high cholesterol levels is essential for people with diabetes, because exposure to high blood glucose levels increases the risk of the arteries narrowing. ""Almonds, peanuts, and pistachios all reduce ""bad"" cholesterol very effectively. ""Bad"" cholesterol refers to small, dense particles of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), too much of which can clog the arteries.""Almonds, walnuts, pistachios, pecans, and hazelnuts reduce ""bad"" cholesterol by increasing levels of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL), or 'good' cholesterol. HDL clears out 'bad' cholesterol, thus reducing the risk of heart disease.""Another food which has been found to lower blood sugar is the onion. A study involving 42 people with type 2 diabetes showed eating 3.5 ounces (100g) of fresh red onion reduced fasting blood sugar levels after just four hours.

Type 2 diabetes: Eat eggs for breakfast every day to help lower blood sugar,"Type 2 diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. High blood sugar levels can seriously damage parts of the body, including the feet, eyes and nerves. One of the causes of type 2 diabetes is a poor diet, so eating certain foods can help manage blood sugar levels. Alongside cutting down on sugar, fat and salt and eating a wide range of foods such as fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta, researchers have found specific foods to have blood sugar-lowering properties. One food which is a popular choice at breakfast, that's also been found to improve blood sugar levels, is eggs.In one study, people with type 2 diabetes who consumed two eggs daily as part of a high-protein diet showed improvements in blood sugar levels. The NHS states eggs are a good choice as part of a healthy, balanced diet, which is recommended for type 2 diabetes.As well as being a source of protein, eggs also contain vitamins and minerals.The health body adds: ""There is no recommended limit on how many eggs people should eat.""Eggs can be enjoyed as part of a healthy, balanced diet, but it's best to cook them without adding salt or fat.""For example, boiled or poached, without added salt, scrambled without butter and using low-fat milk instead of cream.""Frying eggs can increase their fat content by around 50 per cent.""One popular breakfast food which may have a negative impact on blood sugar are bagels. Speaking to Prevention, Matthew Freeby, MD, director of the Gonda Diabetes Center at UCLA Health, said: ""Many of my patients with diabetes think about sugar as being the worst thing that's impacting their blood sugar, but it's really about carbohydrates.""I tell them to look at nutrition labels for the total carbohydrate content, not just the sugar content.""Donuts and bagels made with refined and processed grains are major sources of blood-sugar-spiking carbs.""Foods outside of breakfast have also been found to help lower blood sugar.Several controlled studies have shown the spice cinnamon can lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. One study demonstrated type 2 diabetes patients who took cinnamon for 90 days had more than a double reduction in haemoglobin A1C (a form of haemoglobin that is covalently bound to glucose) than those who only received standard care.The study was titled 'Effectiveness of cinnamon for lowering hemoglobin A1C in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, controlled trial'.In three trials involving cinnamon cassia, fasting glucose levels fell by between 10.3 per cent and 29 per cent with no significant changes in those on placebo.",https://t.co/dDAmiWvSTA,news
Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?,"Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Raspberries are a delicious fruit that has been widely consumed for thousands of years. They are packed full of vitamins, minerals, and powerful antioxidants that may help prevent disease and promote health. Various studies have shown that the fruit holds a plethora of health benefits, ranging from improving cardiovascular health to preventing cancer. Raspberries are also found to be beneficial in preventing as well as managing type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that the fruit may also aid weight loss.Type 2 diabetes is a chronic health condition that causes the level of blood sugar (glucose) to rise. Over time, high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, can affect your health from head to toe, resulting in a number of complications, including heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, eye damage, etc. By keeping your blood sugar under control, you can avoid all these health problems. Eating a diet high in fibre can help keep blood sugar level stable. Raspberries boast of many nutrients, including fibre, despite being low in calories, making them a great food for diabetics.How can raspberries help prevent or treat type 2 diabetes?Previous studies have shown that consuming a high-fibre diet can help improve blood glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in type 2 diabetes. Two new studies, published in Obesity and Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, suggested that eating raspberries can significantly help prevent and manage diabetes.The first study, which investigated people with 'pre-diabetes' and insulin resistance, found that eating raspberries for breakfast can help reduce glucose levels two hours later. Likewise, the second study reported that eating berries were associated with lower blood sugar levels. The results from these trials suggested that raspberry consumption could be an important dietary component for people at risk of type-2 diabetes.Also, one study found that red raspberries have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolism-stabilising properties, all of which can help reduce the risk of several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study conducted at the Centre for Nutrition Research, Institute for Food Safety and Health, Illinois Institute of Technology, also found that red raspberries contain components that can also reduce heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, the two common complications of diabetes. The research was published in Advances in Nutrition.Other health benefits of raspberriesStudies have shown that fibre and water content in raspberries may help prevent and treat constipation, aiding in maintaining a healthy digestive tract. It's worth noting that increasing fibre intake has also been linked to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as boost weight loss.The bottom line is that eating low-calorie, high-nutrient foods like raspberries as part of a healthy diet may help manage diabetes, support weight loss, and boost health. Just ensure that the fruit you bought is organic to reduce your risk of exposure to pesticides.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

"Dates and diabetes, Do dates raise blood sugar? this is what science says﻿","Dates are deliciousfoods and are rich in nutrients such as iron and antioxidants. But it is alsohigh in calories compared to other dry fruits, and it is usually notrecommended to take much of it at once. Diabetics are also advised, often, todiscard these delicious foods such as dates. Is there any truth to this? Isthere a relationship between dates and diabetes.Do dates raiseblood sugar?According to Dr MuktaVasistha, a nutritionist, everyone, yes everyone, can eat dates! And not just apill, you can take from two to three without problems depending on your bloodsugar level and this is for the healthy and not diabetics.But what aboutdiabetics?Diabetics are usuallyasked to avoid high-calorie foods such as dates and the reason of that is thesefoods may lead to high blood sugar levels.Can diabetics eat dates?The regulation ofblood sugar levels in the human body is done by the insulin hormone, a hormonethat is poorly produced in diabetics. And when it's not present in sufficientamounts, glucose would not be burned and therefore will rise in the bloodstreamin patients with diabetes. If you ask anyone with diabetes, they will tell you that dates are on the list of ""do not eat"" foods. It should not be. According to experts, diabetics can also benefit from the high fiber content of dates. It is OK to eat 2-3 dates a day for diabetics as long as they are careful and maintain healthy habits in eating in general.On average, a diabetic is allowed to get up to 10 percent of the totalcalories in his diet of sugar on a regular basis. Taking3 dates and consuming other sugary nutrients will increase blood sugar levels.So dates raise sugar if we eat too much of it.If you are a healthy dieter, andyour daily activity includes a minimum of 30 minutes of activity, eating twodates when you have a desire to eat sugar may not be bad after all.Nutrients of dates and its relationship with diabetes:The nutrients in datesare very easy to digest; Dates are composed of fibers, iron, potassium, vitaminB, B6, A and K, tannins, copper, magnesium, manganese, niacin, pantothenicacid, riboflavin. All of them help to improve metabolism in the body. Fibers: Helps lower blood pressure and inflammation; In addition, the consumption of insoluble fiber helps reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Beneficial effects of oral chromium picolinate supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized clinical study,"JavaScript is disabled on your browser. Please enable JavaScript to use all the features on this page.Beneficial effects of oral chromium picolinate supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized clinical studyHighlights•Diabetic patients received 600 μg/day CrPic supplementation 4 months.•CrPic supplementation reduced fasting and postprandial glucose, and HbA1c values.•No changes in lipid profile were found in the supplemented group.AbstractBackgroundChromium is an essential mineral that contributes to normal glucose function and lipid metabolism. This study evaluated the effect of chromium picolinate (CrPic) supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).MethodsA four month controlled, single blind, randomized trial was performed with 71 patients with poorly controlled (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] &gt; 7%) T2DM divided into 2 groups: Control (n = 39, using placebo), and supplemented (n = 32, using 600 μg/day CrPic). All patients received nutritional guidance according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and kept using prescribed medications. Fasting and postprandial glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and serum ferritin were evaluated.ResultsCrPic supplementation significantly reduced the fasting glucose concentration (−31.0 mg/dL supplemented group; −14.0 mg/dL control group; p &lt; 0.05, post- vs. pre-treatment, in each group) and postprandial glucose concentration (−37.0 mg/dL in the supplemented group; −11.5 mg/dL in the control group; p &lt; 0.05). HbA1c values were also significantly reduced in both groups (p &lt; 0.001, comparing post- vs. pre-treatment groups). Post-treatment HbA1c values in supplemented patients were significantly lower than those of control patients. HbA1c lowering in the supplemented group (−1.90), and in the control group (−1.00), was also significant, comparing pre- and post-treatment values, for each group (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). CrPic increased serum chromium concentrations (p &lt; 0.001), when comparing the supplemented group before and after supplementation. No significant difference in lipid profile was observed in the supplemented group; however, total cholesterol, HDL-c and LDL-c were significantly lowered, comparing pre- and post-treatment period, in the control group (p &lt; 0.05).ConclusionsCrPic supplementation had a beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients with poorly controlled T2DM, without affecting the lipid profile. Additional studies are necessary to investigate the effect of long-term CrPic supplementation.KeywordsType 2 diabetes mellitusChromium picolinateDyslipidemiaDietary supplementsRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Cheese may help control blood sugar,"In a new study, researchers found eating cheese could help control blood sugar levels.The finding may help improve health in people with pre-diabetes.The research was conducted by a team from the University of Alberta and funded by Dairy Farmers of Canada (C.B.C.).Cheese's high-fat content has made it unhealthy in the minds of many people. But recent studies have found that cheese can bring many health benefits.For example, one study found that yogurt and cheese in a Mediterranean diet may help fight heart disease. It's even more effective than a low-fat diet.Another study showed that a protein-filled snack like cottage cheese can be a healthy snack before sleep.The dairy snack could provide a positive effect on muscle quality, metabolism, and overall health.In the current study, the team focused on how cheese affected insulin sensitivity.They fed pre-diabetic rats that both low-fat and regular cheese and found the blood sugar levels in the mice were improved.The team found that both low-fat and regular cheese normalized the phospholipids that are derived from dietary fats and are critical for many functions in the body.The finding supports existing studies that show cheese doesn't increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes.The finding suggests that eating cheese doesn't make things worse and may actually help reduce heart disease or diabetes risk.It is good news for those who love regular cheese but worrying about the fat content.Future work needs to find out how exactly cheese helped stabilize insulin levels.The researchers suggest that the current recommendations about eating cheese need to be revised.Currently, many guidelines recommend people reduce their cheese intake or just eat low-fat cheese.The researchers also cautioned people with health issues to ask their doctor or a dietitian first about cheese in their diets. But for most people, it's part of a healthy diet.The finding also provides a basis to continue researching the issue.This study helps to provide a rationale for further studies in humans and help make more rational decisions about dietary recommendations.The lead author of the study is nutrition expert Catherine Chan.The study is published in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry.Copyright © 2019 Knowridge Science Report.

Stuck in 'hell': Cuban asylum seekers wither away in Louisiana immigration prisons,"Suicide. Self-harm. Medical neglect. Isolated in segregation. Quarantined and left without legal counsel.More than 100 Cuban men who have been left to rot in remote Louisiana immigration prisons have faced these and other hardships since as early as 2017, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) locked them up.The men whose stories are told below endured severe persecution in their home country before fleeing to the U.S. They all entered the country legally and are seeking asylum the way the U.S. government dictates. All were found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture in their home country by the asylum officers who screened them upon arrival. None has committed a crime.Yet, confined against their will, they are effectively denied a fair shot to secure their release.""The cruel irony is that most asylum seekers who follow the law and present at official ports of entry do not have the right to ask an immigration judge for release from custody,"" said Laura Rivera, an SPLC staff attorney. ""Instead, their only avenue for release is to ask the very agency that confined them, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).""But DHS is ignoring its mandate to carefully consider requests for release and is instead issuing blanket denials of parole, Rivera said. The men are kept hidden from the outside world, incarcerated and punished for defending their rights, and forced to try their cases before immigration judges who deny them at rates of up to 100 percent. Some have said they are being targeted ""simply for being Cuban.""To help secure the men's release, the SPLC and the Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative (SIFI) – a project of the SPLC that provides pro bono legal counsel to detained immigrants throughout the Deep South – have partnered with other pro bono attorneys and colleagues at Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy (ISLA). SIFI has also approached federal lawmakers and engaged in public advocacy.In the summer of 2018, the men participated in a hunger strike and peaceful protest to demand that ICE provide them with information regarding their cases. Their requests went ignored. Instead, they were penalized and forced to further withstand the inhumane treatment that has led many to feel as if they are losing their minds.The situation becomes more dire each day. The men do not understand why the judges dismiss their cases.The names of the men below have been changed in some instances to protect their identities.As one of them said, ""In Louisiana, they can do whatever they want to you.""Read their harrowing stories below.",https://t.co/sWPylXMqHd,news
Weight loss surgery changes how the body metabolizes food,"A recent Cell Reports study by UK and US researchers examined how weight loss surgery changes the body's response to food.Bariatric surgery is a form of surgery performed on the stomach and intestines to promote weight loss. The surgery is widely used to treat obesity and has also been shown to improve symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Lower blood sugar levels are common after weight loss surgery and can be partly attributed to a lower body weight, which enhances the body's sensitivity to insulin. This effect is especially beneficial to diabetic patients who have developed insulin resistance, a condition in which the body does not use insulin properly. When insulin is not used properly in the body, glucose remains in the blood and is unable to be transferred to the cells where it is needed.Weight loss surgery has been shown to change the way the food is digested and absorbed in the gut. Studies have also shown that certain gut hormones increase after bariatric surgery, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). However, until recently, the relationship between surgery and these hormonal changes was not well understood. In a recent study published in Cell Reports, UK and US researchers examined the role of GLP-1 in regulating insulin production after weight loss surgery.How surgery changes insulin sensitivityGLP-1 is a major hormone involved in therapies for type 2 diabetes, and many anti-diabetic medications help regulate GLP-1 levels. For the study, the researchers examined five lean patients who had undergone gastrectomy, a type of bariatric surgery used to treat or prevent gastric cancer. Each participant was given Exendin-9, a compound that binds to GLP-1 and blocks its activity, along with a glucose drink.In normal circumstances, glucose consumption triggers insulin production in the pancreas. Insulin then enters the bloodstream and supports the uptake of blood glucose by cells in the body. However, excess insulin production can lead to hypoglycaemia, a condition marked by abnormally low blood sugar levels that can have serious side effects.Although bariatric surgery can improve the symptoms of type 2 diabetes in obese patients, it can have harmful effects on the blood sugar levels of lean patients. Because bariatric surgery increases insulin sensitivity, lean patients with normal blood sugar levels who undergo surgery are at risk of hypoglycaemic episodes.GLP-1 is a major driver of insulin production after bariatric surgeryThe study showed that Exendin-9 lowered levels of insulin in post-surgical patients. As a result, these patients did not experience the hypoglycaemic episodes normally seen in lean patients after bariatric surgery. Because Exendin-9 binds to GLP-1, the researchers concluded that GLP-1 is a major driver of insulin production after bariatric surgery.The study also looked at why GLP-1 levels rise after weight loss surgery. Bariatric surgery changes the structure and layout of the guts in the body and affects how nutrients are digested and absorbed. Normally, digestion begins higher up in the guts. However, after surgery, digestion and absorption occur lower down where GLP-1 is produced. This anatomical change leads to more production of GLP-1, as the cells that produce GLP-1 are stimulated by a higher amount of nutrients in the lower gut.Physical changes after surgery cause an increase in GLP-1 levelsThe results help explain the mechanism behind insulin production after weight loss surgery. The study shows that GLP-1 has a major role in insulin secretion and that anatomical changes due to surgery are responsible for increases in GLP-1 levels. It also points to potential targets for treating hypoglycaemia in non-diabetic surgical patients. In the future, the researchers hope to explore less invasive treatments that can mimic the effects of surgery based on these hormonal changes.Written by Braydon Black, BScReferences:Larraufie P, Roberts GP, McGavigan AK, Kay RG, Li J, Leiter A, et al.

Type-2 diabetes: Why this one drink could lower blood sugar levels,"Type-2 diabetes is a lifelong condition which causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to increase.In order to reduce symptoms, it is important to take medication and have regular check-ups.Another way to control type-2 diabetes is by watching what you eat and drink on a daily basis.The NHS recommends a range of foods, including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods, like pasta.Meanwhile, one certain hot drink has been found to contain blood sugar lowering qualities. In a 2012 study, called ""Coffee, Caffeine and Risk of Type-2 Diabetes"", found drinking coffee may help lower the risk of type-2 diabetes.The researchers found the level of risk dropped even lower for people who drank two to three cups a day.But it remains unclear what coffee components may be responsible for the apparent beneficial effect of coffee on glucose metabolism. ""It's fine to drink tea and coffee as part of a balanced diet""NHSThese results, which were tested on younger and middle-aged women in the US, showed for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees.According to the NHS, drinking three to four cups of coffee a day can reduce the risk of type-2 diabetes by 30%.It also found that the hot drink was linked to a lower risk of disease or death.However, it is important to enjoy coffee in moderation, as the NHS warned: ""It's fine to drink tea and coffee as part of a balanced diet, but it's important that these drinks are not your main or only source of fluid.""Meanwhile, if you're worried about developing type-2 diabetes, it is advised to visit your local GP. HOT DRINK: According to a study, coffee is good for type-2 diabetes sufferers (Pic: GETTY STOCK IMAGE) However, it is important to keep an eye on the following symptoms:1. Peeing more than usual, particularly at night2. Feeling thirsty all the time3. Feeling very tired4. Losing weight without trying to5. Itching around your penis or vagina, or repeatedly getting thrush6. Blurred vision TYPE-2 DIABETES: Symptoms include a number of things, like rapid weight loss and extreme thirst (Pic: GETTY STOCK IMAGE) The NHS states that you're more at risk of developing type-2 diabetes if you:1. Are over 40 - or 25 for south Asian people2. Have a close relative with the condition3. Are overweight or obese4.

A study, conducted by the US National Library of Medicine National Institute of Health, found that kale juice could help sufferers.It examined whether a daily dose of the juice could modulate blood pressure and blood glucose.As part of the findings, the study found kale juice could help regulate blood sugar levels.But the vegetable doesn't necessarily have to be enjoyed in juice form, kale can also be enjoyed in salads and dishes.It is packed full of essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients that have minimal negative impact on blood sugar levels.Researchers say eating green leafy vegetables, like spinach, cabbage, broccoli and bok choy, can help with diabetes.The NHS advise making the following lifestyle changes if you have type-2 diabetes:Eat a wide range of foods – including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pastaKeep sugar, fat and salt to a minimumEat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day – don't skip meals If you're worried about type-2 diabetes, it's advisable to visit your local GP.Alternatively, look out for the following symptoms:1. Excessive thirst: Feeling constantly thirsty is one of the most common symptoms of diabetes. It's usually coupled with dryness in the mouth and can be one of the first signs to develop.2. Slow healing: The disease makes healing more difficult due to high blood glucose levels.3. Insatiable hunger: A sudden increase in appetite, particularly sweet cravings, can also be a symptom of the condition. This is because of the really high or really low blood sugar levels.4. Sleep issues: People with diabetes often experience problems getting to sleep and remaining asleep. This can be caused by pain, discomfort, the need to urinate, Restless Leg Syndrome, and sleep apnea.5. Skin issues: You might experience skin dryness and itchiness or darkening of the skin (acanthosis nigricans). This is due to circulation problems.",https://t.co/oT3vcYSl4S,news
Texas Jail Nurse Allows Woman to Die in Diabetic Coma; Refuses Blood Sugar Test,"The parents of an insulin-dependent 20-year-old diabetic woman who died in an Texas jail cell after a licensed nurse ignored her pleas and refused to help released a surveillance video of her death Thursday in hopes it will bring about changes in the ""prison for profit"" industry.""We want to see things change in jails everywhere. Morgan had a family that loved her,"" Jennifer Houser, the mother of Morgan Angerbaur said.""This has to change. Nobody deserves to die like that.""​Morgan Angerbauer, 20, was booked into Bi-State Justice Building in Texarkana in the afternoon of June 28 for violation of her probation for possession of drugs – the same jail we reported on last month where guards killed a man on camera who told them multiple times, ""I can't breathe.""She was found dead in her cell three days later on July 1 after a jailhouse nurse refused to administer a blood sugar test – despite the fact Angerbauer banged on her cell door over several hours asking to get her blood tested.Brittany Johnson, the licensed vocational nurse who refused her requests for blood tests, has since been charged with negligent homicide, a misdemeanor.In the days leading to her death when they did test her blood, Angerbauer's glucose readings were so high they exceeded the jail's equipment's testing range.But she was never taken to the hospital.The video shows Johnson, who admitted she refused to check on Angerbauer's blood sugar, finally entering the cell at 4:12 a.m. after previously ignoring several of her cries for help.​Angerbauer's last dose of insulin was administered at 5:30 a.m. on June 30.At 10:30 a.m., nurse Tiffany Venable, documented Angerbauer's blood sugar at 74, which is within the normal range of 70-110.At 4:30 p.m. Venable noted that Angerbauer refused a blood sugar test.According to jail policy, refusals are documented when an inmate doesn't show up for a pill call even if the inmate is asleep or incapacitated.At around 5 p.m., Angerbauer tells nurse Brittany Johnson she wanted her blood sugar checked.Johnson refused.""Johnson also admitted that she was fully aware of the severity of Angerbauer's medical diabetic situation, but rather than treat her, she told her that things don't work that way, if you miss your medical call you have to wait until it's time for your next medical call,"" the affidavit for Johnson's arrest states.""Johnson told investigators that if she allowed all offenders to do that, she'd never get anything done.""Angerbauer had been pleading for help throughout the night.At around 4:00 a.m., trustees at the jail observed Angerbauer laying unconscious in her jail cell and informed medical staff.At 4:12 a.m., video shows Angerbauer unconscious next to what appears to be vomit when Johnson looks through the glass panel in her cell. At this point, Angerbauer has received no insulin in almost 23 hours.Johnson appears to yell at Angerbauer, flips the lights off and on, and knocks on the glass window of her jail cell.About a minute later, a correctional officer opens the door to Angerbauer's cell for Johnson. She walks in carrying a folder and shakes Angerbauer.Angerbauer is motionless and doesn't move or respond.Nurse Johnson leaves then returns with a tube of glucose used for diabetics and squirts it into Angerbauer's mouth at around 4:15 a.m.A correctional officer stands by Angerbauer, attempting to provide support, as she remains motionless and by this time appears completely unconscious.At 4:37 a.m., Angerbauer's body appears lifeless, her legs are lopsided, her mouth is open and her head is tilted back.At this point, nobody on the medical or jail staff bothered to call 911 for medical attention, although one correctional officer appears to be texting as he stands in the doorway.Nurse Johnson continues to test Angerbauer's blood sugar levels while Angerbauer remains limp and unresponsive.At 4:57 a.m., a female correctional officer enters the cell with a video camera.A male correctional officer standing in the cell begins talking on a cordless phone, presumably calling 911 attempting to summon paramedics for medical help.Paramedics arrive and enter Angerbauer's cell at 5:06 a.m. just shortly after Johnson decided to administer CPR, using a portable defibrillator.Emergency personnel is unable to revive Angerbauer. Paramedics leave at 5:10 a.m. just minutes after they arrive.About a minute later, Johnson closes Angerbauer's eyes, places an orange sheet over her deceased body and exits the jail cell.Brittany Johnson, A Licensed Nurse Was Arrested On August 15 For Negligent Homicide, A Misdemeanor, After She Refused To Test Morgan Angerbaur's Bloodsugar Which An Autopsy Shows Soared To 813 At The Time Of Her Death.​Johnson has pleaded not guilty to charges negligent homicide. Her next court date, which is set on a trial docket, is in February.Andy and Jennifer Hauser, the parents of Angerbauer, filed a lawsuit for civil rights violations and wrongful death, which can be seen below or read here.""It was the most excruciating thing I've ever had to do in my life,"" Jennifer Houser said after viewing the video of her daughter's death. ""All of those people, all had cell phones, not one of them thought to call 911.""""Her civil rights were stripped away the moment she entered that cell,"" Jennifer Houser said.""Had they just taken her to the ER in the first 30 minutes, there is a good chance she would've lived,"" Matthew Campbell, the attorney representing the Houser's said. ""They didn't follow their own procedures ""Campbell says Angerbauer should have been taken to the hospital by at least June 29 when several of her blood sugar readings were over 400 and 500 to be treated for ketoacidosis and high blood sugar levels.The lawsuit Campbell filed on the Houser's behalf names nurse Brittany Johnson; LaSalle Corrections, the company responsible for managing the Bi-State Jail; LaSalle owners and administrators as well as Johnson's supervisor, along with 20 John Doe and Jane Doe defendants who failed to call for emergency help, but have yet to be identified.The Houser's say they hope the aftermath daughter's death and their pending lawsuits will prompt the ""prison for profit"" system to re-evaluate and spark changes in jails across the country.Angerbauer's death at the Bi-State jail in Texarkana comes less than a year after inmate Michael Sabbie's death at the same jail after he was pepper sprayed.Sabbie complained to correctional officers he could not breathe. But like Angerbauer's, Sabbie's pleas for help were ignored by staff at Bi-State jail.​",https://t.co/dPzXxItP4m,news
Apple's Working on a Sensor That Can 'Smell' Your Blood Sugar Levels,"Apple's various devices already sport advanced health sensors, but a couple of recent patent applications suggest that the company is looking into even more health-related technology.The patent applications were published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday. And they suggest more advanced health sensors could be coming to future iPhone and Apple Watch products. Here's what you should know.Air Pollution SensorThe first of the two patents, ""Compact Particulate Material Sensor,"" details a system that can essentially detect air pollution. More specifically, it details a couple of possible solutions that could be used by a consumer device to detect particulate matter in the air. The first solution relies on a pulsing light source and a series of photodetectors, while the second solution entails an electric circuit that could be set to ""reject"" background light.Apple suggests that these sensors could be used to alert users to fine particulate matter in the air, otherwise known as pollution. That includes matter that's invisible unless in high densities, but could nevertheless cause respiratory issues if inhaled.Low Blood Sugar DetectionThe second patent application, ""Systems and Methods for Environment Sensing,"" is arguably the more interesting of the two. Put in the simplest way possible, the patent describes a system that could detect chemicals in the air.Like the first patent, this could prove useful for ambient environment sensing. A consumer device could detect dangerous chemicals in an environment and alert its user — essentially serving as a digital canary in a coal mine. But Apple suggests it could go beyond safety applications, claiming that the system could use sensors to detect smells tied to certain ""chemical species."" If this data is fed into a machine learning algorithm, the patent contends that it could be used for ""smell recognition capabilities.""The system would use ionic liquid sensors embedded on a chip. These sensors could detect specific chemicals in the air, as well as how much of it is present.Apple goes so far as to say that the system could be used to ""spoiled food material detection"" or ""body odor detection."" Yes, an iPhone that can tell if your food has gone bad or whether you forgot to put on deodorant.But the patent also suggests that it could be used for health applications. One example is ""smelling"" a user's sweat to determine if their blood sugar is low. That could allow for non-invasive glucose monitoring, something that Apple is already rumored to be working on.Apple's Health AmbitionsThese patents would be much less interesting if it wasn't for Apple's clear ambitions in the health and wellness sector.The Apple Watch and iPhone both have a suite of health-related sensors and features. They can track various health metrics and make them easier for users to understand. The Apple Watch even has an established reputation for saving lives.That's not even considering platforms like CareKit and ResearchKit, Apple's first-of-its-kind Apple Watch study in partnership with Stanford, or its more miscellaneous health-based endeavors.In other words, it seems clear that Apple has big ambitions for the health sphere. And while patent applications aren't a good indication of Apple's future plans, these two particular patents seem like they line up perfectly with Apple's broader goal for health.",https://t.co/a0m4SBWs0U,news
Does including ginger in the diet help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"Does including ginger in the diet help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes? Posted by Medivizor on Apr 21, 2019 in Diabetes mellitus | In a nutshell The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ginger consumption on blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The main finding of the study was that patients who consumed ginger had improved blood sugar control.Some background Ginger is a non-toxic spice that is considered safe by the FDA. Some studies have shown ginger to be beneficial in patients with (T2D). HbA1c is a blood test that measures average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. It is a marker of blood sugar control. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) is blood sugar levels when a patient has not eaten in 8 or more hours. FBS is usually high in T2D.The effect of ginger in the diet of HbA1c and FBS in patients with T2D is still under debate.Methods &amp; findings This study analyzed results from 8 different trials. These included 454 patients with T2D overall. Patients in the trials were assigned to consume either 1600– 4000mg ginger daily or not to consume any ginger.There was no significant difference in the FBS levels of patients who consumed ginger and those that did not consume ginger. However, patients who consumed ginger had a significant improvement in their HbA1c levels. Patients who did not consume any ginger had no improvement in their HbA1c.The bottom line The authors concluded that dietary ginger did not improve FBS levels but did improve HbA1c in patients with T2D. They suggested that ginger might have an impact on blood sugar control over a longer period of time.The fine print The studies included were very small. Larger studies are needed for better evidence.What's next? If you have any concerns about T2D and diet, please consult with your doctor.Original Title :Dietary ginger as a traditional therapy for blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Type 2 diabetes: Eating yoghurt proven to lower blood sugar and prevent the condition,"Type 2 diabetes is a common condition in the UK that can lead to complications involving the nerves, feet, eyes and kidneys. One of the best ways to manage blood sugar levels and to prevent the condition is to eat a healthy diet. Eating a wide range of fruit and vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta are just some of the ways to incorporate health eating into your lifestyle. Experts also recommend keeping sugar, fat and salt to a minimum.But certain foods alone have been found to have blood sugar-lowering properties - for example yoghurt.A Journal of Nutrition analysis of 13 recent studies concluded yoghurt consumption as part of a healthy diet may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in healthy and older adults. And recent research has shown yoghurt consumption may be association with lower levels of glucose. Research published in 2011 also suggested eating probiotic yoghurt could improve cholesterol levels in people with type 2 diabetes.Probiotics are the bacteria that live in the gut which help improve digestion, as well as overall health.Look for yoghurts high in protein and low in carbohydrates, such as unflavoured Greek yoghurt.A probiotic will contain live and active cultures called Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium.When it comes to drinks to lower blood sugar, kale juice has been shown to help. A small-scale study showed kale juice could help regulate blood sugar levels. As part of the findings, participants achieved this result by drinking 300ml of kale juice per day for six weeks.But kale doesn't necessarily have to be enjoyed in juice form.Kale in its natural form can still benefit a person's blood sugar levels.Like all green leafy vegetables, kale is packed full of essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients that have minimal negative impact on blood sugar levels.Alongside diet changes, being active can lower your blood sugar.The NHS recommends you do 2.4 hours of activity a week.""You can be active anywhere so long as what you're doing gets you out of breath,"" to says.Examples of exercise include:Fast walkingClimbing stairsDoing more strenuous housework or gardening",https://t.co/Xz4KjwoYVO,news
"Study Finds Diabetes Drug May Prevent, Slow Kidney Disease","FILE – In this Monday, Sept. 24, 2018 file photo, a patient undergoes dialysis at a clinic in Sacramento, Calif. Results of a study released on Sunday, April 14, 2019 show that the diabetes drug Invokana has been shown to help prevent or delay worsening of kidney disease, which causes millions of deaths each year and requires hundreds of thousands of people to use dialysis to stay alive. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) By MARILYNN MARCHIONE AP Chief Medical WriterA drug that's used to help control blood sugar in people with diabetes has now been shown to help prevent or slow kidney disease, which causes millions of deaths each year and requires hundreds of thousands of people to use dialysis to stay alive.Doctors say it's hard to overstate the importance of this study, and what it means for curbing this problem, which is growing because of the obesity epidemic.The study tested Janssen Pharmaceuticals' drug Invokana. Results were discussed Sunday at a medical meeting in Australia and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.About 30 million Americans and more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes, and most cases are Type 2, the kind tied to obesity. It occurs when the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, which turns food into energy.This can damage the kidneys over time, causing disease and ultimately, failure. In the U.S., it's responsible for nearly half a million people needing dialysis, and for thousands of kidney transplants each year.Some blood pressure drugs lower this risk but they're only partially effective. The new study tested Invokana, a daily pill sold now to help control blood sugar, to see if it also could help prevent kidney disease when added to standard treatments.For the study, about 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease from around the world were to be given Invokana or dummy pills. Independent monitors stopped the study early, after 4,400 people had been treated for about 2.5 years on average, when it was clear the drug was helping.Those on the drug had a 30% lower risk of one of these problems — kidney failure, need for dialysis, need for a kidney transplant, death from kidney- or heart-related causes, or other signs that kidneys were failing.For every 1,000 people taking the drug for 2.5 years, there would be 47 fewer cases of one of these problems, researchers estimate.Rates of serious side effects were similar in the drug and placebo groups including leg, foot or toe amputations, a concern raised by a previous study of Invokana. One side effect, when the body can't produce enough insulin, was more frequent among those on Invokana but rare overall.Janssen, which is part of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, sponsored the study and many authors work or consult for the company. The drug costs about $500 a month in the U.S. Out-of-pocket costs for patients may be different, depending on insurance.The importance of this large and well-done study ""cannot be overstated,"" Drs. Julie Ingelfinger and Clifford Rosen, editors at the medical journal, wrote in an accompanying article.In recent years, several studies have found that Invokana and some similar drugs can lower heart risks. The new results, showing that Invokana also may stall or prevent kidney failure, expand the potential benefits of the drug.___Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

A CGM that doesn't require finger pricks,"I have Type 1 diabetes, which means my body doesn't produce any insulin. So I have to inject insulin to regulate my blood sugar and check my levels by using a glucometer. This means I have to stick my finger with a needle anywhere from 5 to 10 times a day.Dexcom provided me with a review unit of its new G6 continuous glucose monitor that's approved by the FDA to require no blood at all.CGMs allow diabetics to see their blood sugar throughout the day and night with a sensor that is inserted under the skin. Previously, CGMs needed a blood glucose reading in order to calibrate the device.The new Dexcom G6 comes factory-calibrated and requires no finger stick. I've been wearing the device for nine days and I am really impressed with it.The insertion is painlessCNBC's Erin Black inserts the Dexcom G6 sensorCNBC | Jeniece PettittThe G6 comes with a new auto-applicator that allows one-button insertion. And wow, was it smooth. I didn't feel a thing.Side-by-side comparison of Dexcom G5 and G6 applicatorsCNBC | Jeniece PettittThis is a huge improvement from Dexcom G5 inserter that required you to push the needle under the skin yourself. It's definitely the most painless thing I've had to put in my body in the 20 years of using syringes, insulin pens and pumps. The Dexcom G6 CGM auto-applicator.CNBC | Jeniece PettittThe insertion device itself is big. And I did feel bad about throwing it away after its one-time use. But because the device is so accurate, I don't need to check my blood sugar as much, which means I've been using fewer glucose strips in my meter. So I feel it will even out in the end.The sensor took a few days to become accurateAfter the sensor warmed up, it was off by 25 mg.CNBC | Erin BlackAfter the sensor finished its two-hour warm up, I double-checked the reading it gave me with my glucometer. It was 25 points off.Now I did just finish a workout, which is a highly volatile time for my blood sugars usually. But even when I checked before going to bed that night, it was still 20 points off. As I used it, the number got closer and closer to accurate, and by day 3 it was matching my meter exactly. On the fifth day of using it, I found myself not worrying about double-checking it anymore.After 2 days, the sensor could accurately read my blood sugar.CNBC | Erin BlackThe sensor now lasts 10 days instead of 7. Some users like to reuse G5 and previous sensors to cut on costs of buying more. But the G6 has a hard shut off after 10 days and can't be re-used.The transmitter is more comfortable and smaller than the G5Looking at the G5 and G6 transmitters side by side, they don't look that different. But once I have the transmitter snapped into the sensor it felt much smaller. The design is sleeker with a 28% lower profile and it sits flush against the sensor. I found it much easier to sleep on it than the previous versions.The Dexcom App has some cool new featuresThe Dexcom G6 app displays real time glucose data.CNBC | Jeniece PettittIf you had a G5, you'll have to download the new G6 app. It looks pretty much the same. The numbers are a little smaller. At first, I found it harder to read than the old app.The Urgent Low Soon feature on the Dexcom G6 app.CNBC | Jeniece PettittThis version has a new feature called Urgent Low Soon that warns users in advance of a dangerous low (55 mg/dL). I appreciated this feature a lot because some lows aren't as urgent as others.It also features an alert schedule that allows you to customize alerts and alarms for different times of the day. These alerts notify you when you are heading high or low.You can still share your data with 5 other people, which is a must-have feature for parents of children with Type 1. The app is available on iOS and most Android devices.If you don't use the app, the G6 comes with a new receiver. Since I use my phone to monitor the sensor, I didn't even take the receiver out of the box.The G6 system requires a prescription and cost varies by insuranceThe Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring systemCNBC | Erin BlackIt is hard to say how much the G6 system will cost you, as it will vary under different insurance plans. Dexcom also accepts out-of-pocket payments, and while the company hasn't revealed the price yet, my G5 costs around $800 up front plus $35 for each sensor, so you can expect to spend a couple thousand dollars a year total.But I think the benefit of having one outweighs the cost.Being able to peer inside your body and know what your blood sugar is 24/7 is amazing feature, and this device allows me to do it more discreetly and with fewer finger pricks. It's the best CGM I've ever tried and I think that you'll like it too. All this being said — if your glucose alerts and readings from the G6 do not match symptoms or expectations, use a blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions. The Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System will be available in June 2018.",https://t.co/TlsvLrkky7,news
"Alphabet Verily stops Smart Lens, glucose-measuring contact lens","Google smart contact lens to measure glucose levels in tears.Source: GoogleVerily, Alphabet's life sciences arm, has paused work on its so-called ""smart lens"" program, which was aiming to put tiny sensors on contact lenses to measure blood sugar levels in tears.If it worked, the lenses could help diabetics track their glucose levels in real time and in less invasive ways than the traditional meters that require piercing the skin. But in a blog post on Friday, Verily said that after four years of research it has determined that detecting blood sugar in tears is a massive — and potentially insurmountable — technical and scientific undertaking. ""Our clinical work on the glucose-sensing lens demonstrated that there was insufficient consistency in our measurements of the correlation between tear glucose and blood glucose concentrations to support the requirements of a medical device,"" the company said.Verily made a big splash when if first launched the program in 2014, while it was still known as Google Life Sciences. The company partnered with Alcon, Novartis' eye-care division, on the project. However, it's been quiet about the project in the past few years, leading to speculation that it was winding down.Verily said it did have some success with the experiment in a controlled environment, but not in actual tests because of the dynamic environment of the eye. It's a problem that goes beyond Verily.Billions of dollars have been spent on research and development, but companies across both technology and life sciences have struggled. There's even a book dedicated to documenting these failures titled ""the pursuit of noninvasive glucose: hunting the deceitful turkey.""Google and other technology companies including Apple remain interested because non-intrusive glucose monitoring would be a game changer for millions of people. More than 100 million people are living with diabetes or pre-diabetes in the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and many are required to prick their finger multiple times per day to get their glucose levels.Verily stressed in the post that it will continue with its other projects in the diabetes space through its other life sciences partners:We remain committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes including through improved methods for inexpensive and unobtrusive glucose sensing to support diabetes management. We are working closely with Dexcom to develop miniaturized continuous glucose monitors and with Onduo, our joint venture with Sanofi, to integrate continuous sensing into the care paradigm for people living with Type 2 diabetes.It also has other projects with Novartis, including an investment in a bio-tech growth fund.The company doesn't see its contact lens program as a loss. It said it has uncovered other potential, more near-term opportunities through its work to sense and transmit data around the eye.Verily has started working on a ""smart"" contact lens for age-related farsightedness, as well as a ""smart"" lens for improving sight after a cataract surgery.WATCH: Diabetics are hacking old insulin pumps to make them smarter — here's what happened when I tried it",https://t.co/RfTEVDxsfm,news
"Average Glucose, Standard Deviation, CV, and Blood Sugar Variability","By Adam Brown and Divya GopisettyWhat do these numbers mean, what's the target, and how can they provide insight into better diabetes management? Example days included!Glucose monitoring is one of the most important tools in diabetes. Just like a speedometer in a car, glucose data helps inform key actions in diabetes – take more or less medication, change food choices or timing, exercise, and more. Most of us think of glucose data in an immediate sense for guiding therapy decisions: ""How much insulin should I take right now?"" However, it also helps inform longer-term patterns: ""My blood sugar has been consistently high after breakfast for the past two weeks; why might that be and what can be done about it?If you have access to continuous glucose monitoring and ever downloaded your CGM or blood glucose meter (BGM), you might have noticed some of the following statistics:Average (mean) glucoseStandard deviation (SD)Coefficient of variation (CV)% time-in-range, % high, and % lowLast December, we covered time-in-range in two articles – Kelly Close and Adam interviewed 15 experts and then wrote ""What do experts think about goals?"" and Adam took a personal look at all his CGM data and wrote, with lots of advice from many of the same experts, ""What's an achievable time-in-range goal with diabetes?"" This article is about the first three statistics: average (mean) glucose, SD, and CV.The information below on mean glucose, SD, and CV is relevant to all readers who monitor their glucose, though it's often not available on the device itself – you must usually download your meter or CGM to a paired app or computer software. At the end of this article, we've listed options for some of the most commonly used devices.In this piece, we've turned yet again to the experts! This article integrates feedback from a dozen of the world's smartest thinkers (endocrinologists, educators, researchers) on glucose monitoring and glucose variability.What is mean glucose? What's a good target? ""Mean glucose"" is another way of saying ""average glucose."" It's an overall measure of blood sugars over a period of time, offering a single high-level view of where glucose has been. A lower mean glucose often indicates fewer high blood sugars; however, it can also indicate a lot of low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) are occurring.Many experts look for a mean glucose of less than 154 mg/dl in adults with diabetes, which approximates to an A1C less than 7% (the target in the USA). In kids, the target is slightly higher: an A1C less than 7.5%, which corresponds to mean glucose of 170 mg/dl. Some professional organizations also advocate for lower A1C levels in adults around 6.5%.However, these are population averages. As we've discussed previously, in ""What's a Normal A1C? When is it Misleading?"", the relationship between A1C and mean glucose can vary quite a bit from person to person. Still, aiming for a mean glucose of less than 154 mg/dl in adults and less than 170 mg/dl in kids is a good starting point for most – check with your healthcare team, of course, if you are making major changes. Over the long term, the goal is the lowest possible average glucose without frequent, prolonged, or severe hypoglycemia, based on evidence from the DCCT and UKPDS.For those wondering, in people without diabetes, mean glucose is typically 100 mg/dl or less, which corresponds to an A1C of less than 5.7% (the cutoff for diagnosing prediabetes). The cutoff for diagnosing diabetes is an A1C of 6.5%, corresponding to a mean glucose of roughly 135 mg/dl.Knowing one's average glucose over a period of time is kind of like knowing the average temperature over the course of a month or the average speed over a road trip – it doesn't tell you what happens in different moments or what to change. However, mean glucose can be a useful flag that high or low blood sugars are common. For instance:A mean glucose of 225 mg/dl could indicate a lot of high blood sugars are happening, implying changes are needed – e.g., a higher medication dose, different food choices. Dr. Irl Hirsch also pointed out that this kind of average could imply medication doses are being missed, especially for those with type 1. Many experts brought up a caveat, however: a mean glucose of 225 mg/dl can still hide a lot of low blood sugars! Before making changes to increase medication, it's important to make sure hypoglycemia is not occurring – ideally with professional or personal CGM.If mean glucose is 100 mg/dl and someone is experiencing many low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) every day of the week, changes are needed too – e.g., closer attention to when the hypoglycemia is happening in order to determine the best action, such as differently timed exercise or a lower medication dose.What are SD and CV? Why do they matter?SD and CV are two statistical values that provide a different lens to look at glucose variability, similar in a way to time-in-range (TIR) numbers.""SD"" is shorthand for ""standard deviation,"" which is a measure of the spread in glucose readings around the average – some call this the variation. For example, if someone has been bouncing around between many highs and/or many lows on a given day, they will have a larger SD. On the other hand, if someone is having a pretty stable day, she will have a lower SD.The goal is the lowest SD possible, which would reflect a steady glucose level with minimal swings – just like in someone without diabetes. You can see that the standard deviation that is ""normal"" in people without diabetes, based on data from Berlin and EASD, was below 20 in all age groups! Most people with diabetes would not have nearly that low an SD. However, SD must be interpreted in context with the mean glucose, which leads us to the third metric: coefficient of variation (CV).CV is a fancy term for a simple calculation: dividing the SD by the mean glucose and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. For example, if the SD is 50 mg/dl, and the average glucose is 150 mg/dl, then you divide 50 by 150, multiply by 100, and you get a CV of 33%.Why use CV instead of SD? SD is highly influenced by the mean glucose – someone with a higher mean glucose will have a higher SD. This division helps ""correct"" and normalize glucose variability, allowing us to set a single variability goal that applies to people with different mean glucose levels.What should SD and CV be? Generally speaking, most experts like to see a CV of 33% or lower, which is considered a marker of ""stable"" glucose levels. This means aiming for an SD that is less than one third of the mean glucose. For instance, for someone with a mean glucose of 180 mg/dl, the target SD is 60 mg/dl or less. For a mean glucose of 150 mg/dl, SD would ideally be under 50 mg/dl. (Some find it easier to multiply in the other direction: SD x 3 should be smaller than mean glucose.)The targets above have two caveats:Children and teens type 1 diabetes: Multiple experts told us that very young patients with diabetes tend to have higher variability than adults. Dr. Greg Forlenza noted that 2-6-year-olds will often have standard deviations of 80-100 mg/dl or a CV in the mid-to-high 40%'s. Similarly, Dr. Jake Kushner noted that an SD of 50 mg/dl would be ""awesome"" in many teens, who are often struggling with diabetes. Dr. Irl Hirsch added that high SDs over 100 mg/dl, often seen in teens, often mean mealtime insulin is being missed.People with type 2 diabetes: Dr. Roy Beck pointed out that people with type 2 diabetes generally have lower CV than people with type 1, especially if they are not using insulin. And, even those with type 2 using insulin tend to have lower CV than those with type 1.Why are SD and CV important to know? Dr. Robert Vigersky shared the following three reasons:Glycemic variability may be an independent risk factor for diabetes complications. This is still controversial and not proven. For those desiring a deeper dive, this foundational paper from 2006 in JAMA links glycemic variability to oxidative stress. (It's been cited over 2,000 times!) See follow-up papers from 2008 and 2011.High glycemic variability makes you feel bad: the ups and downs from fluctuating glucose levels are exhausting, even if the average looks okay. Dr. Forlenza put it this way: ""I often describe higher SD or CV to my patients as the feeling that they're always high or low and not having normal values. Higher glycemic variability often reflects greater frustration with diabetes – it's that 'my numbers are all over the place' feeling.""SD/CV reflect variability in a single number, which can be more digestible than juggling many numbers. The larger the variability, the greater the risk of disabling hypoglycemia.To give some life to these numbers, let's take a look at a few daily examples from Adam's CGM data – one with more variability, one with less variability, and one with extremely low variability. These are intended to be illustrative and not for comparison. Many experts reminded us that all three of these days have lower variability and lower mean glucose levels than what many people with diabetes experience – it also helps to keep in mind that numbers are just information to make a decision, not judgment or grades (read Adam's column on this mindset here).For those not yet familiar with CGM, each black dot represents a glucose value taken every five minutes over the course of 24 hours. The graph is laid out from midnight on the left, 12 noon in the middle, and midnight on the right.Example #1: More Variability (CV of 41%)There are lots of reasons over the years that Adam's glucose numbers have been highly variable – particularly before he had CGM! Here's one where he tested low-carb vs. high-carb. On October 15th, Adam's mean glucose was 123 mg/dl, but his day was full of exhausting ups and downs. A number that gives away the day's challenges was Adam's SD: 51 mg/dl. Despite having a lower average glucose of 123 mg/dl, Adam spent a significant 13.5% of his day in hypoglycemia (over three hours!) and his time in range was about 56%. He also had a higher-than-usual SD of 51 mg/dl. His CV of 41% (51 divided by 123 x 100) was also higher than usual, indicating more blood glucose swings throughout the day. Because Adam's average blood sugar was fairly low in this example, the high variability resulted from many dips into hypoglycemia.This example illustrates why knowing average glucose is not enough! Here, a low average of 123 mg/dl sounds good, but there was higher variability than usual for Adam (SD: 51), which meant a lot of time spent in hypoglycemia. Plus, Adam's quality of life was simply poorer on this day, a point he really stressed in his low-carb vs. high-carb article.While someone wearing CGM would be able to detect all the hypoglycemia and hopefully respond quickly, it would not be obvious with a blood glucose meter alone. Meters give only a handful of glucose data points per day and rarely are fingersticks taken in the critical overnight period. As a result, it's important for those using a glucose meter to know both the average and SD, aiming for the targets mentioned above.Example 2: Less Variability (CV of 29%)Let's take a look at another day with the exact same average glucose of 123 mg/dl, but this time, with much less variability. On July 23rd, Adam's average glucose was also 123 mg/dl – the same average as the high variability day above. However, the SD was much lower at 36 mg/dl, which translated to a CV of 29% (i.e., less than 1/3 of the mean, the goal). On this day, despite the same average glucose as October 15th (above), Adam's time spent in range (70-140 mg/dl) was 70%, much higher than the first example, and the CV here was about half the level in the first example. Adam's time in hypoglycemia was also much lower at 2.8% – though even that is still about 40 minutes.Example #3: Little Variability (CV of 14%)On June 13, Adam experienced his lowest glucose variability of this year: an average glucose of 107 mg/dl and an SD of just 15 mg/dl, translating to a CV of just 14%. Adam's time-in-range was 100% on this particular Bright Spot day. As seen in the chart below, his glucose was extremely steady throughout the day, never dipping below 70 mg/dl or above 140 mg/dl.How does Adam use all of this? The purpose of glucose monitoring is to use the data to drive actions and inform decision making:When is my glucose consistently staying in range and why might that be occurring? How can I increase these Diabetes Bright Spots? For example, do you have more on-target numbers the next day after a full night of sleep? If so, that is extra motivation for you to get the rest you need! Read more on sleep and diabetes here.When is my glucose going high or low and why might that be occurring? How can I reduce these Diabetes Landmines from happening? For example, does eating late dinners tends to lead to an out-of-range morning glucose with a higher SD and CV on the following day? If so, you may try earlier dinners without snacking afterwards. Related to nighttime, Dr. Irl Hirsch also reminded us about the impact of alcohol, especially in large amounts – usually it leads to higher glycemic variability (whether those are lows or highs depends on the type of alcohol).Ask yourself how you feel when your variability is high, medium, or low. If you feel better with low glucose variability, try to identify patterns – what did you do? What might you test out? Keep a record of how you feel and see if tricks to reduce glucose variability correlate with feeling better and more productive. Adam's tips to reduce glucose variability are summarized in his book.Of course, knowing one's average glucose, SD, CV, and time-in-range are starting points. They can help flag patterns, but usually taking action requires a deeper dive. For instance:An above-target average glucose (e.g., 180 mg/dl) and high standard deviation (70 mg/dl) would indicate much of the day is spent at a very high blood sugar. The key question is WHY those highs are occurring and what to do about it.How many carbs are being eaten at one time? What food choices might be driving blood sugar high? (Adam eats less than 30 grams at one time, since it has a dramatic impact on reducing blood sugar variability.)Is a medication change needed?(If applicable) Are mealtime insulin doses being taken at least 15 minutes before eating? Is the right amount of insulin being taken?(If applicable) Are you factoring in protein and fat? Dr. Jake Kushner reminded us that protein converts to blood glucose too, although the conversion takes several hours and is not easy to predict. Fat can also slow the absorption of carbs and increase glucose over several hours. A big steak will still increase glucose and may need insulin delivered over a longer period of time (i.e., ""square wave"" or ""extended"" bolus for pump patients).Conversely, a below-target average glucose (e.g., 120 mg/dl) and high standard deviation (e.g., 50 mg/dl) would indicate a high risk for severe hypoglycemia. If you currently use a glucose meter, wearing professional CGM (FreeStyle Libre Pro, Medtronic iPro2) or real-time CGM (Dexcom G6, FreeStyle Libre, Medtronic Guardian Connect, Senseonics Eversense) could help identify when lows are occurring. And once those lows are identified, medication can be adjusted accordingly.It can help to look at glucose monitoring over a period of time – say two weeks – but also to look at it on a day-by-day basis. A starting point target, as noted above, is an average glucose under 154 mg/dl and a standard deviation under 50 mg/dl. If you wear CGM, see our previous pieces on time-in-range goals: What do experts think about goals? and What's an achievable time-in-range goal with diabetes? Technology can enable better glycemic variability: both CGM and automated insulin delivery have been demonstrated to reduce glycemic variability, and so does using BGM thoughtfully and keeping good records.Dr. Rich Bergenstal reminded us that therapy decisions should not be based on just one metric. An in-range mean glucose can be hiding many lows. An on-target SD or CV is often a good sign, but there are many examples of very consistently low or high blood sugars with very little variation. A time-in-range of 80% might be viewed as excellent, but not if the other 20% is low.Finally, remember that there are at least 42 factors that impact blood sugar. Food, exercise, stress, sleep, and medication are just a few of the many factors that can directly influence your blood sugar. While average glucose, SD, and CV will provide insight into your diabetes, remember they are not tests with a pass or fail grade. Rather, consider these metrics to find/replicate Bright Spots and identify/avoid Landmines! The goal is learning and action, not judgments and blame. We'd recommend looking at this data with your healthcare team – below is how to get the data!How to Download Your Glucose Data from a Meter or CGMBelow is a partial list of apps and software for viewing glucose data from blood glucose meters and CGM devices. Most apps and software are brand-specific, though Glooko and Tidepool are compatible with a wide range of devices.Note: Historically, SD has been the go-to variability metric, as it was usually the only number that software provided.

"The ""Normal Blood Sugar Range"" May Be Misleading You","The ""Normal Blood Sugar Range"" May Be Misleading You Even glucose levels within the normal blood sugar range can be damaging. A fasting blood sugar test measures the amount of a type of sugar, called glucose, in your blood after you have not eaten for at least eight hours. Checking for an ideal fasting blood sugar is one of the most commonly performed tests to check for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. So what should your fasting blood sugar be?The normal blood sugar range is 65-99 mg/dL.If your fasting blood sugar is between 100 and 125 mg/dL, you have ""impaired fasting glucose,"" also referred to as ""prediabetes.""If your fasting blood sugar is more than 126 mg/dL on two or more occasions, you have full-blown diabetes.Take command of your diabetes, simplify blood sugar management, and make the most of today's breakthroughs in diabetes treatment!Claim your FREE copy, right now, of our definitive guide on diabetes.What Is Prediabetes?People defined as having impaired fasting glucose/prediabetes are individuals whose blood sugar levels do not meet criteria for diabetes, yet are higher than those considered normal. These people are at relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), prediabetes is not a disease itself but rather a risk factor ""for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease.""[1]However, the ADA also state that prediabetes can be considered an ""intermediate stage"" in the diabetes disease process.[1] (One might wonder how prediabetes can be a both a risk factor for diabetes and an intermediate stage of the diabetes disease process simultaneously).In addition to increasing the chance of developing diabetes, it's well-established that people with impaired fasting glucose/prediabetes are more likely to be overweight or obese, especially with what's known as abdominal or visceral obesity. They also are more likely to have high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.[1]Even Normal-Range Blood Glucose Levels Can Increase Diabetes RiskThere's a lot more at stake for those with prediabetes, too. Studies show that even those with fasting blood sugar levels towards the high end of the optimal glucose level may be at significantly higher risk. In fact, these cut-offs for what are considered ""normal,"" prediabetes, and diabetes blood sugar ranges are somewhat arbitrary. The truth is that blood sugar starts damaging body tissues and increasing your risk of numerous diseases even at levels lower than prediabetes levels.A panel of experts gathered by the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists confirmed this in 2008 when they reviewed all the science on prediabetes and diabetes. They found that the risks of having elevated blood sugar—including heart disease, strokes, kidney damage, nerve damage, dementia, and cancer—start at numbers much lower than those used to diagnose pre-diabetes or diabetes.[2]In other words, even if your normal fasting glucose level falls within the optimal range, you could still be damaging your heart, brain, and other tissues—and setting yourself up for diabetes symptoms down the road.What's an Optimal Glucose Level?At this point you might be wondering what constitutes an optimal fasting blood sugar range. Some studies indicate that an ideal fasting glucose level is less than 90 mg/dl and likely somewhere around 85 mg/dl.[3,4] However, the optimal fasting blood glucose level likely depends on additional factors related to blood sugar regulation. The fasting blood sugar test provides only a small amount of information regarding how your body handles sugar. There are other important tests, such as the glucose tolerance test, the insulin response test, and the Hemoglobin A1c test, which are considered by many experts to be more important indicators of prediabetes and other problems with blood sugar metabolism.What should you do if your fasting glucose is not within the normal blood sugar range?If your fasting blood sugar is above 85 or 90 mg/dl, don't panic. There is so much you can do to improve your blood sugar control. It all comes back to the basics:Adopts a diabetic diet that boosts intake of healthy foods while decreasing intake of sugar and empty carbs.Exercise regularly.Reduce stress.There are many useful natural therapies and dietary approaches for hypoglycemia and lowering blood sugar that we've covered in previous articles. For ideas, start by reading the following:This article was originally published in 2016. It is regularly updated.

Is the Glycemic Index Reliable for Predicting Blood Sugar Response?,"The infographic below has been making the rounds recently on social media and is based on the idea that high Glycemic Index (GI) foods can be represented by the effect those foods have on people's blood sugar, compared to teaspoons of sugar.(Reference ""from bit.lv.carbs-vs-fat"")The infographic below is one that I designed to explain the work of Dr. David Unwin who communicates the concept of Glycemic Index (GI) &amp; specifically Glyemic Load (GL) in terms of how they impact blood sugar compared to teaspoons of ordinary table sugar, as outline in this post on my affiliate web site.Here is one of Dr. Unwin's infographics which describes the effect each food has on blood glucose based on Glycemic Index (1). Infographic for health professionals to show how the glycemic index helps inform dietary choices (from Unwin D, Haslam D, Livesey G. It is the glycaemic response to, not the carbohydrate content of food that matters in diabetes and obesity: The glycaemic index revisited. Journal of Insulin Resistance. 2016;1(1))The problem is, these tools are only as useful as Glycemic Index is reliable, so the question is, is GI (and GL which is derived from it) reliable for predicting blood sugar response?If the Glycemic Index (GI) values (1) change between individuals for the same amount of the same food or (2) if they change value within the same individual when they are assessed at different times, then they cannot be relied on to predict blood sugar response in an individual.Is Glycemic Index Reliable for Predicting Blood Sugar Response?A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2) reported that individual response to individual carbohydrate-containing food vary so much that Glycemic Index values may not be useful in indicating blood sugar response in individuals.The StudyRandomized, controlled, repeated tests on 63 healthy adults participated in 6 testing sessions over a twelve week period and fasted and abstained from exercise and alcohol before each session.During each session participants ate either (1) white bread (test food) or (2) a standardized glucose drink (reference control).Blood sugar values were measured at several points over the next 5 hours, and Glycemic Index was derived by testing the test food and reference in the same participant according to standard method. This is usual practice to control for the variability between people which may be caused by biological differences.ResultsOut of the 63 participants, in 22 participants blood sugar response was classified as ""low"", in 23 participants it was classified as ""medium"" and in 18 participants it was classified as ""high' for the same amount of bread.That is, white bread fell in all three Glycemic Index categories with different individuals. In addition, responses within the same individual varied by as much as 60 points between tests.Interpretation of the ResultsThe study indicated that blood glucose response is affected by differing physical structure of similar foods, the effect of food processing and preparation methods, as well as meal consumption patterns (single or mixed meals).The study authors concluded that the high inter- (between people) and intra-individual (within the same person) variation that was observed in the GI value of foods essentially resulted in the results being of no practical value.""In summary, our data indicate substantial variability in GI value determinations for white bread despite the use of standardized methodology and multiple testing in a large number of healthy volunteers. The high degree of variability demonstrates that there is potential to misclassify foods into the 3 commonly used GI categories (low, medium, and high), which would result in the inability to distinguish between foods, thus invalidating the practical applicability of the GI value."" The authors also indicated that this variability was also partly explained by differences in baseline HbA1c (i.e. glycated hemoglobin) which is an estimate of 3 month average of blood glucose control, as well as the insulin index (the differing insulin response to foods) both affect the GI value.Individual Glycemic ResponseIt should be noted that inter-individual and intra-individual variation in glycemic response isn't only to white bread, as in the above small study.A 2015 study from Israel(3) involving 800 people who were monitored with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) indicates that there isn't a 'universal' blood sugar response to either low Glycemic Index foods or high Glycemic Index foods, and that glycemic (blood sugar) response is very individual.""We continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility"".Some Final Thoughts…One cannot reliably predict that a specific amount of carbohydrate-based food will raise a person's blood sugar the same amount as a certain number of teaspoons of sugar, because each carbohydrate based food will have different effects on different people, and different effects within the same individual, at different points in time.More Info?If you would like to know how to determine how you respond to specific carbohydrate-based foods and how to know which carbohydrate-based foods spike your blood sugar and which don't, I can help.You can learn more about my services including individual appointments and packages above under the Services tab or in the Shop.If you have questions, please feel free to send me a note using the Contact Me form above and I will reply as soon as I can.To your good health!JoyYou can follow me on:Twitter: https://twitter.com/lchfRD Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BetterByDesignNutrition/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lchf_rdCopyright ©2019 BetterByDesign Nutrition Ltd.

Balance Your Blood Sugar for Overall Health,"Blood Sugar problems can cause a lot of health concerns that have grave complications. Here are some ways to balance blood sugar levels for better health. Does Blood Sugar Problems Just ""Happen""?'Blood sugar dysregulation does not suddenly emerge.You cannot wake up one day with a blood sugar issue and not have a clue that something is going wrong.Type II diabetes follows an insidious pattern of development and involves, to some extent, dysregulation in the three organs of sugar regulation: the endocrine pancreas, the liver, and the adrenal glands. These three organs work in harmony to regulate and normalize blood glucose levels across the day and night.' (1)'Hypoglycemia and insulin resistance are not mutually exclusive.If you have one you most likely have some degree of the other. Either way, both are a sign your blood sugar is unstable and either dropping too low, spiking too high, or both.Both cause the insulin surges that skew so many other systems in the body.' (2)This post may contain affiliate links from which I will earn a commission. Thanks!Why You Need to Balance Your Blood SugarAs a nutritional therapist, stabilizing blood sugar is the number one issue I deal with and usually the first thing I work on with all of my clients.Balanced blood sugar will help to manage one's overall mood. When balanced you can expect to reduce stress, confusion, brain fog, irritability and more. You will find you sleep well, lose weight and have more energy.Having balanced blood sugar is the KEY to good health. Moving From Blood Sugar Problems to Type 2 Diabetes How your body progresses from Hypoglycemia to DiabetesStep 1. Reactive Hypoglycemia is when you have low blood glucose levels due to an over-reactive attempt of the body to control increasing blood sugar levels. This is due to a diet high in refined carbohydrates or a high glycemic diet. If this is not remedied through dietary changes it can lead to;Step 2. Insulin Resistance or Pre-diabetes (Syndrome X) -A condition where insulin becomes less effective at lowering blood sugar. Chronically high insulin levels lead to insulin resistance as the cell receptor sites for insulin become blocked. If this is not remedied by dietary changes it can lead to;Step 3. Hyperglycemia is when consistently elevated blood glucose levels circulate in the blood plasma, due to the inability of cells to properly utilize insulin. Someone with a consistent BGL range between 100-126 mg/dL (according to the American Diabetes Guidelines) is considered hyperglycemic. If this is not remedied through dietary changes it can lead to;Step 4. Type II Diabetes – this is due to continued insulin resistance that causes the beta cells of the pancreas to continue pumping out insulin, and eventually they become completely exhausted to the point where they no longer can produce insulin. Chronic hyperglycemia is the medical marker for Type 2 diabetes.What is Insulin Resistance?Insulin Resistance is important to talk about when discussing blood sugar levels. Any time a cell is exposed to excess insulin, it becomes more insulin resistant. It's that simple.Why?When the excess glucose won't be taken by the cells, the liver or the muscles or fats cells because they are already full, that means it has nowhere to go.So, the insulin is left to circulate in the blood stream.This means that the pancreas will now trigger even more insulin to get the circulating insulin to go somewhere, as this is it's job. Eventually, the glucose will have to get out of the bloodstream and get stored. This helps you to begin to see the endless spiral towards insulin resistance.Eating more sugar or starch causes one to crave more sugar, but then becomes a very nasty vicious debilitating cycle.How Insulin Resistance Happens and What it CausesImagine insulin as a truck carrying sugars into our cells. The truck enters the cells using a special garage-door opener. If the opener stops working, the truck is stuck in the driveway. Soon after, another truck will pull up behind the first one and they'll both become trapped.Eventually a whole fleet of trucks will be backed up, causing a major traffic jam throughout the body – or chronically high insulin. All of this happens because the garage door opener (aka the insulin receptor) is no longer responding to the presence of the truck (aka insulin).Once our cells become resistant to insulin, losing weight becomes harder than ever. Moreover, physiological changes start to occur in the body, signaling a condition called 'metabolic syndrome', this is the clinical manifestation of insulin resistance. This means the blood sugar is chronically too high and as a result cause inflammation, imbalanced hormones and neurotransmitters, all which lead to rapid degeneration of the brain.None of us can afford to have our brains under attack, as this speeds up the aging of our brains also increasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Did you know that scientists are now dubbing Alzheimer's disease 'Type 3 diabetes."" If you have diabetes you are much more likely to end up with Alzheimer's. (3)Clearly, having imbalanced blood sugar is no minor issue we face as humans in this modern day of excess sugar consumption.If you have grown up on a typical standard American diet, you probably have insulin resistance.The longer you remain insulin resistant, the more likely you are heading towards type 2 diabetes. And, you don't necessarily have to be overweight to have diabetes, though that is a key marker.Anyone with a waist girth that is greater than their hips has cause for concern.The good news is, you CAN do a lot to improve your health and lead a normal life. However, it will take hard work and sticking to a diet that keeps your blood sugar balanced, moderate regular exercise and avoiding food allergens.Let's take a quick look at some dietary principles to start getting your body's blood sugar balance back on track.Some Helpful Dietary Guidelines for Balancing Blood SugarPROTEIN Consume 3-5 ounces of protein at every meal, 1-2 ounces with every snack. Optimally, the best sources of protein are grass-fed meats, pastured poultry, wild seafood and pastured eggs.Legumes are not a complete or optimal source of protein, plus they are rather high in carbohydrates which will likely spike your blood sugar.FATSThere are lots of reasons why you might want to eat fat. Check with your doctor and if recommended, eat good healthy fats with every meal and snack.Fats are very satiating and the optimal source of fuel for your body–do not skip or skimp on the fats.VEGETABLESOrganic, in season, low glycemic veggies are unlimited. Eat as much as you want. Limit carrots, beets, and root vegetables – using in smaller portions and make sure to balance well with other lower glycemic veggies.Avoid white potatoes – they are very high in starch (small amounts of fermented potatoes may be okay once your blood sugar is more balanced. The fermentation process actually helps to reduce the starch content). Properly fermented vegetables (like this homemade sauerkraut) are allowed and highly recommended.NUTSSoaked nuts or raw nuts are acceptable in small portions, a handful is adequate. Don't overdo it on the nuts. Peanuts are not recommend, they are actually legumes.*Note* – Nuts can be problematic for some people, causing digestive issues/complaints or even allergies/sensitivities. If this is the case for you, leave them out of your diet for at least 2 weeks to a month then try again one at a time. Some people will need to keep nuts out for much longer.FRUITLimit fruits to 1-2 servings of low glycemic fruits. Avoid fruit at breakfast for the most part. Once your blood sugar is under control you may be able to tolerate fruit in the mornings here and there.Avoid the sweeter fruits such as; bananas, mangoes, papayas, grapes and dried fruits. No fruit or vegetable juices at this time, even fresh pressed at home.Fruit is best as a mid-meal snack paired with some fat. (ex: I like to make homemade coconut milk smoothies or even drizzle some organic coconut oil over sliced peaches)DAIRYMost people will need to avoid dairy – it can have an insulin effect. Ghee is acceptable to use. This is different for everyone – you will have to find out what works for you as an individual.If you do choose dairy, make sure it is not pasteurized and comes from grass fed cows. Choose only full fat dairy products, never low fat or skim as this will actually spike your blood sugar and cause weight gain.However, if you have gone through an elimination diet or gone through GAPS intro and you know you are not sensitive to dairy – you can have some dairy, such as butter, small portions of GAPS approved cheeses, a small amount of sour cream with meals or as a dip for veggies.Avoid entire meals of dairy, such as a large glasses of kefir or a yogurt as your meal.SWEETENERSFor some people, in order to balance blood sugars, you will want to truly eat no sweeteners of any kind.Zip. Zilch. Zero.Stevia is okay in green leaf form on occasion if need be, but not for those with severe sugar imbalances.AVOID – Grains, Legumes and Most Starches. Even properly prepared grains and legumes can cause a blood sugar spike. Once you get your blood sugar under control and more balanced you can add back small amounts of properly prepared starches, keeping in mind to avoid the problematic ones that you may be sensitive to.Never assume you can go back to carbohydrate-laden meals like most Americans do today.BEVERAGESWater is best – try to drink half your weight in ounces of water per day. It is VERY important to make sure you get enough electrolytes as well.Adding a pinch of good quality sea salt to your drinking water is ideal, especially the water you drink during and after your workouts. Water makes up 70% of our bodies – it is the most important and critical nutrient we need. Adding a slice of lemon to your water is also a good option. Make sure, however, that you know how to make choose a good water filter.Avoid, alcohol, fruit juice, milk.AVOID CAFFEINEThis is a biggie – caffeine actually disrupts your blood sugar. If you are a coffee drinker, take the first two weeks to wean off of coffee – decaf is better but still has caffeine. 1 cup of decaf can be okay. Dandy Blend is a popular coffee substitute that can be used. As well as organic herbal teas with no additives of any kind. This Rich and Nutritious Coffee Substitute is a great option as well.That is a basic clean diet to balance blood sugar. Most people need to shift more slowly into a diet like this. Some people can jump right into it without much trouble at all and end up feeling amazing rather quickly. Everyone will be different, but the common denominator is to watch your overall carbohydrate intake.More Blood Sugar HelpsIntermittent FastingHave you heard about Intermittent Fasting?There is growing evidence that intermittent fasting contributes to better control of blood sugar.It's really incredible information.

Ipragliflozin versus metformin for blood sugar control and fat reduction in type 2 diabetes,"Ipragliflozin versus metformin for blood sugar control and fat reduction in type 2 diabetes Posted by Medivizor on May 17, 2019 in Diabetes mellitus | In a nutshell The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ipragliflozin compared to metformin in improving blood sugar control and reducing fat on organs in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with sitagliptin. The main finding of the study was that ipragliflozin had greater reductions in fat but metformin had better blood sugar control.Some background There are many different medications used to treat T2D. Different drugs are used in a different order all over the world. For example, in the United States and Europe, metformin (Glucophage) is used first. If blood sugar is not controlled with metformin, other drugs are added such as DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2-inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) include sitagliptin (Januvia), Vildagliptin (Galvus), Saxagliptin (Onglyza), Linagliptin (Tradjenta. SGLT2 inhibitors include drugs such as ipragliflozin (Suglat). In Asia, DPP-4is are used first and metformin is added after. The best combination of these drugs remains unclear.When fat accumulates in the body, it gets deposited on some organs such as the liver and pancreas (the organ that controls blood sugar). This is called visceral fat (VF). VF causes these organs to not work properly and therefore blood sugar is not controlled.It is not known which of the diabetic medications is better at reducing VF and improving blood sugar.Methods &amp; findings This study included 98 patients with T2D and were taking a DPP-4is (sitagliptin). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ipragliflozin 50mg daily or metformin 500mg daily (increased to 1000 daily after 2-4 weeks). Patients were treated for 24 weeks.After 24 weeks, the ipragliflozin group had significantly greater reductions in VF than the metformin group. They also had significantly greater reductions in body weight and waist measurements. However, the metformin group had significantly greater reductions in their HbA1c (blood test measuring average blood sugar control over the past 3 months) than the ipragliflozin group. The metformin group also had significantly greater decreases in their LDL cholesterol (""bad cholesterol"". The ipragliflozin had an increase in both LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol (""good cholesterol). The ipragliflozin group also had greater reductions in the amount of fats in the blood.The bottom line The authors concluded that ipragliflozin was better in reducing organ fat whereas metformin was better at improving blood sugar control and cholesterol in patients with T2D treated with sitagliptin.The fine print This study had a very small number of patients and only included Japanese patients. Different ethnicities have different responses to medications.

Type 2 diabetes: The citrus fruit proven to help lower blood sugar - Express,"diabetes can trigger symptoms such as excessive thirst, feeling tired and needing to pee a lot. Left untreated, it can lead to long-term health problems involving the nerves, eyes, kidneys and feet, and can lead to cardiovascular disease. But one of the best ways to help manage your blood sugar levels is to eat a healthy diet. This should consist of a wide range of fruit and vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta. One fruit in particular which has been proven to help type 2 diabetes is the orangeSugar, fat and salt should also be kept to a minimum.One fruit in particular which has been proven to have blood sugar lowering effects is the orange.Research has demonstrated citrus fruits, such as oranges, have anti diabetic effects.Citrus fruits are a great way to get vitamins and minerals without the carbohydrates.Research has shown two bioflavonoid antioxidants, called hesperidin and naringin, are responsible for oranges' antiabetic effects. Other examples of citrus fruit are grapefruits and lemons. Type 2 diabetes: A certain citrus fruit has been proven to have blood sugar lowering effects (Image: GETTY)Fruits are also a good source of fibre, which has been shown to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. A study published in 2018 suggests a high fibre diet can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 20 to 30 per cent.The research noted this effect came mainly from whole grains or insoluble cereal fibre.Other studies, however, have shown a combination of insoluble and soluble fibre in the diet can be beneficial.Soluble fibre absorbs water, turning it into a gel-like substance, while insoluble fibre doesn't. Type 2 diabetes: The bioflavonoid antioxidants in oranges have proven effective (Image: GETTY) Type 2 diabetes: Fruit, nuts and seeds are food sources of fibre that can lower blood sugar (Image: GETTY)Alongside fruit, other good source of fibre include:Nuts and seedsWhole grainsLegumesFibre is considered an essential part of the diet, particularly for a person with diabetes.Carbohydrates with high fibre take longer to digest than those in low fibre foods, reducing the chance of a blood sugar spike.Fibre also helps a person feel fuller for longer, making them less likely to overeat (being overweight is a risk factor for the condition developing).Government guidelines published in July 2015 say dietary fibre intake should be 30g a day, as part of a healthy balanced diet.Alongside eating a healthy diet, doing certain exercises can help lower blood sugar.

Why cheese may help control your blood sugar,"Mmmm, cheese – a food as nutritious as it is delicious. Or is it? On the one hand, cheese is an excellent source of minerals like calcium and magnesium, vitamins A, B2 and B12, not to mention being a complete protein. On the other hand, cheese is also a significant source of saturated fat and sodium in our diets. To lower saturated fat intake, consuming reduced-fat cheese is sometimes recommended to lower cardiovascular disease risk. Paradoxically, however, there is now a growing body of evidence that people who eat lots of cheese do not have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, including Type 2 diabetes. Our research team at the University of Alberta examined the impact of both reduced- and regular-fat cheese on insulin resistance in the bodies of pre-diabetic rats. We found that both types of cheese reduced insulin resistance, which is important to maintain normal blood sugars.Why we used ratsMany of the studies previously conducted into the impact of cheese on cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been observational. In other words, researchers have studied the usual eating behaviour of large numbers of people, usually for years, and then correlated the amount of cheese (and other dairy foods) eaten with the development of CVD risks, such as high cholesterol or coronary artery disease. Observational studies of human eating patterns cannot be used to determine causation. (Shutterstock) A 2016 survey of published observational studies found that cheese had either a neutral or beneficial effect on several CVD risk factorsThese studies are very useful to establish trends associated with usual eating patterns but they can't definitively say that a particular food causes or prevents a particular disease. To understand causation better, studies that examine the effects of foods in a controlled setting are useful. These studies can be conducted in humans but there are limitations. Thus, studies in laboratory animals can also be useful, particularly in understanding biochemical mechanisms.Cheese and insulin resistanceInsulin resistance is a condition that commonly develops with ageing and obesity, leading to high blood glucose, and risk factor of CVD and Type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to compare how consuming reduced- versus regular-fat cheese affected insulin resistance, and to explore biochemical mechanisms that might explain any observed effects.We used a rat model of insulin resistance that shares many characteristics with humans. We created the model by feeding the rats high amounts of lard. After four weeks, the rats were divided into three groups: 1) lard diet, 2) lard diet and reduced-fat cheddar cheese, 3) lard diet and regular fat cheddar cheese. All the diets had the same total amount of fat, only the source of it varied (lard versus cheese). The rats ate these diets for eight more weeks.The most interesting finding in our research was that both reduced- and regular-fat cheddar cheese reduced insulin resistance in the rats. This suggests that the beneficial effects of cheese might not be related to the amount of fat but to some other component, such as the protein or the calcium.Butter versus cheeseA few new studies in humans have appeared in the literature since we began our study. A group from Laval University and the University of Manitoba compared the effects of eating fats from different sources in men and women with abdominal obesity. Another study tested butter, cheese, olive oil and corn oil diets and found no impact on insulin levels. (Shutterstock) The diet duration was four weeks and each diet was assessed in all the participants. Butter, cheese, olive oil and corn oil diets (32 per cent calories from fat) were compared with a higher carbohydrate diet (25 per cent calories from fat). The researchers examined blood glucose and insulin levels (which are indirect indicators of insulin resistance) and found no effect from any of the fats. However, the blood samples were collected after fasting, so the information about blood sugar was incomplete.Another study that compared reduced- to regular-fat cheese found no overall differences on LDL-cholesterol characteristics in people with cardiovascular disease risk factors, but did not examine blood sugar-related outcomes.Changing blood metabolitesIn our study, we also examined how metabolites in the blood changed after cheese feeding and found similar effects in reduced- and regular-fat cheese. The changes are related to a specific type of molecule called phospholipids, which have many functions in the body. Interestingly, low-circulating phospholipids are linked with diabetes and insulin resistance in humans. The rats fed on a lard diet had lower phospholipid levels. These were normalized in the rats that ate cheese. We are pursuing this line of research now — to understand how cheese regulates phospholipid metabolism and how this relates to insulin resistance.",https://t.co/vNWrqECx95,news
5 Ways to Balance Your Blood Sugar for Weight Loss,"When we eat our body secretes insulin, a hormone created in the pancreas. Insulin is then used as glucose for fuel, or stored as fat for later. Insulin is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels in the body and making sure they don't go too high or low. However, if we're stressed or our diets are over processed, we can develop insulin resistance.When our cells become resistant to insulin due to blockages from toxicity and inflammation, the pancreas begins to overproduce insulin leading to imbalanced blood sugar, sugar-cravings, energy crashes, mood swings, and fatigue.Foods high in sugar or empty carbs like white bread, pasta, potato chips and baked good will often satiate us temporarily but cause a blood sugar spike, followed by a crash within hours of consumption. When the blood sugar is unstable, you may find you gain more weight and experience higher levels of inflammation (more chronic pain or discomfort.)Here are a few signs Your blood sugar may be unstable:When you miss a meal, you become easily irritable (aka ""hangry)Your sugar cravings are ravenousYou're frequently thirstyYou experience brain fog or have a hard time concentratingYou don't always sleep through the nightLosing weight has been difficult for youYou get shaky or jitteryYou need caffeine to survive the dayYou get light headed or dizzy when you haven't eatenHere are 5 Ways to Balance Your Blood Sugar1. Eat Smaller Protein Rich Meals FrequentlyÂ throughout the DayTo stabilize your blood sugar, eat smaller frequent meals throughout the day. When we skip meals or wait too long to eat, our blood sugar crashes and we're at risk of giving into sugar cravings and overeating. All of these behaviors reinforce the pattern, causing more inflammation in the body. With the 30 Day Clean Eating Challenge, our meal plans are designed to help stabilize blood sugar and give you adequate amounts of protein to beat sugar cravings and lose weight. Kiss your brain fog, exhaustion, and lack of motivation goodbye!2. Eat High Fiber, Low-Spike Risk FoodsFoods like leafy greens, veggies, and herbs are all fiber-rich foods that don't cause a big spike in blood sugar. Avoid an excess of foods like white potato, bread, juices (yes, even freshly squeezed), fruit flavored yogurt and baked goods. These all contribute to a spike in insulin. You can also add in extra protein and fat which will satiate your hunger and boost your energy levels! Avocados, chicken, salmon, tuna, and eggs are excellent choices. Ultimately, if you practice Clean Eating, you've got it covered. The focus should be on eating real, whole foods and crowding out the ""bad"" with the ""good"". This alone will help reduce inflammation big-time, leading to more energy and natural weight loss. If you started Clean Eating and are still struggling to lose weight, here are 7 reasons you might be stuck.3. Meal Prep to Avoid Hunger Crashes that Lead to BingingMeal prep is one of the MOST important things to put into action. Without having healthy, balanced meals on hand, it's all too easy to fall into the trap of convenience.

Tips to Optimize Your Blood Sugar Level,"Insulin is essential to staying alive; unfortunately, the vast majority of people have resistance to this essential hormone, speeding up the aging process and contributing to the development of degenerative diseases. Any meal high in grain and sugar carbs typically generates a rapid rise in blood glucose. To compensate, your pancreas secretes more insulin into your bloodstream to lower your blood sugar. Insulin, however, is also very efficient at lowering blood sugar by turning it into fat. The more you secrete, the more fat your body will accumulate. If you consistently consume a high-sugar, high-grain diet, your blood glucose level will be correspondingly high and over time your body becomes desensitized to insulin, requiring more and more of it to get the job done. Eventually, you become insulin resistant and prone to weight gain, and then full-blown diabetic.Prediabetes1 is defined as an elevation in fasting blood glucose between 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and 125 mg/dl. At 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, it formally becomes Type 2 diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 84.1 million American adults — about 1 in 3 — are prediabetic,2,3 and most are unaware of this fact.However, any fasting blood sugar regularly over 90 in my book suggests insulin resistance, and findings by the late Dr. Joseph Kraft — former chairman of the department of clinical pathology and nuclear medicine at Presence Saint Joseph's Hospital, Chicago, and author of ""Diabetes Epidemic and You: Should Everyone Be Tested?"" — suggests a whopping 80% of Americans are insulin resistant, and that's true even if your fasting glucose is normal.4,5The good news is that insulin resistance is one of the easiest health problems to correct. Below I review eight of my top tips for optimizing and maintaining a healthy blood sugar level.Tip No. 1 — Proper Meal TimingIntermittent fasting or compression of your eating window is a powerful approach that facilitates weight loss and helps reduce your risk of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes. In his book ""Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy and Sleep Well Every Night,"" Satchidananda Panda, Ph.D., cites research showing that 90 percent of people eat across a span of 12 hours a day, and many across even longer timespans, which is a clear prescription for metabolic disaster. Intermittent fasting, i.e., the cycling of feast (feeding) and famine (fasting) mimics the eating habits of our ancestors and restores your body to a more natural state that allows a whole host of metabolic benefits to occur.6With regard to insulin resistance, research shows intermittent fasting promotes insulin sensitivity and improves blood sugar management by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates.7While there are a number of different intermittent fasting protocols, my preference is fasting daily for 18 hours and eating all meals within a six-hour window. If you're new to the concept of intermittent fasting, consider starting by skipping breakfast and have your lunch and dinner within a six-hour timeframe, say 11 AM and 5 PM, making sure you stop eating three hours before going to bed. The latter is important, as it helps protect your mitochondrial function. Recent research8,9 shows men who are at risk of Type 2 diabetes can improve their glucose control, thereby lowering that risk, simply by eating all their meals within a nine-hour timeframe — even if they do not implement any other dietary changes. Research10,11 has also shown men who eat supper at least two hours before bedtime have a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer, and women have a 16% lower risk of breast cancer than those who eat dinner closer to bedtime. For more details on why late-night eating is so detrimental, see ""Eating Early Dinner Aids Weight Loss and Lowers Cancer Risk."" When you do eat, focus on healthy protein in moderate amounts and minimize net carbs like pasta and bread, exchanging them for healthy fats like butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and raw nuts. This will help shift you into fat burning mode. On a related side note, when eating, relax and take your time! Research shows rushed eating, which typically occurs when you're stressed, has a significant impact on your blood sugar level. When you become stressed your body also secretes cortisol and glucagon, both of which affect your blood sugar levels as well.12 You can learn more about this in ""How Stress Can Affect Your Blood Sugar Level.""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Click Here &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; AdvertisementTip No. 2 — Monitor Your Blood Sugar LevelAs mentioned, while prediabetes13 is clinically defined as having a fasting blood sugar level between 100 and 125 mg/dl, I strongly believe any blood sugar over 90 mg/dl puts you in the danger zone for insulin resistance. Your blood sugar is measured through a glucose test, of which there are four types:Fasting plasma glucose test — When you fast overnight and take your blood sample in the morning Oral glucose tolerance test — Similar to the fasting blood sugar test, overnight fasting is required for this, and the person's fasting blood sugar level is measured. Afterward, a sugary liquid is provided and the levels are then tested for the next two hours Hemoglobin A1C test — This test checks the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin and will indicate your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months Random plasma glucose test — This makes use of a blood sample that is taken at a random time You could also do 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring, which I've done in the past, although it's pricey and probably not necessary for most people. At the time, I used a Dexcom monitor, which involves inserting a sensor beneath your skin for a week, which takes continuous glucose readings every few minutes. It really helped me fine-tune and evaluate how different foods impacted my glucose levels, and helped me understand the importance of feast-famine cycling. All of that said, for most people, a simple at-home glucose test,14 where you prick your finger and deposit a drop of blood onto a glucose testing strip, will do the job. Ideally, test yourself two to three times a day: first thing in the morning, before your first meal, and a couple of hours after your last meal.Your blood glucose levels will vary throughout the day. According to conventional recommendations, if you are healthy and do not have diabetes, your fasting blood glucose upon waking should be below 100 mg/dL. I recommend aiming for a fasting (when you wake up) level below 90 mg/dL. Before meal time, your glucose level should read between 70 to 99 mg/dL. After meals — or what's called ""postprandial"" and is usually taken two hours after eating — the level should be below 140 mg/dL.There are two measurements used for blood sugar levels. In the U.S., the measurement is in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). In the U.K. and Canada, the measurement for blood sugar is in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). To convert to mg/dL, multiply the amount by 18. For example, if a person in the U.K. says that their blood glucose result is 7 mmol/L, in the U.S. it's read as 126 mg/dL.Tip No. 3 — Monitor Your Blood KetonesAnother valuable test is the blood ketone test, which will tell you whether you're in nutritional ketosis or not. I recommend starting your intermittent fasting routine and monitoring your blood ketones as you go along. The KetoCoachX monitor15 is currently one of the best and least expensive ketone monitors on the market.You're in nutritional ketosis once your blood ketone level is above 0.3 to 0.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).16 Ideally, perform the test first thing in the morning while still in a fasted state (i.e., before ingesting anything). Having a fasting ketone level above 1 mmol/L is a sign you're in deep ketosis. Once your fasting ketones are greater than 0.3 mmol/L, then you can start incorporating partial fasting as described in my book, ""KetoFast: Rejuvenate Your Health With a Step-by-Step Guide to Timing Your Ketogenic Meals."" The partial fasting regimen described in ""KetoFast"" essentially mimics ancestral eating patterns, allowing your body to work optimally by allowing for periods of breakdown and cleanout, and periods of rebuilding and rejuvenation.Among the many health benefits of cyclical fasting is improved circulating glucose and lipid levels.17 For a summary of my KetoFast protocol, see ""Avoid the Dark Side of Fasting and Ketosis With KetoFasting.""Tip No. 4 — Radically Limit Net Carbs Until You Are Metabolically FlexibleAlong with intermittent fasting, you'll also want to adopt a cyclical ketogenic diet, which involves radically limiting carbs (replacing them with healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein) until you're close to or at your ideal weight. As with intermittent fasting, this will allow your body to start using fat as its primary fuel rather than carbohydrates. Twenty grams of carbs a day is on the low end of what's typically recommended to maintain nutritional ketosis, although some may be able to eat up to 50 grams a day and still maintain a ketogenic state. The only way you'll know how many total carbs, fiber and net carbs you eat is to keep a food diary. The simplest way of doing this is to use an online nutrition tracker. Also remember you need to measure your ketones to determine if and when you're in nutritional ketosis. One of the primary reasons you develop insulin resistance is because you're eating too many net carbs (total carbs minus fiber), too much protein and too little healthy fat. For optimal health, your body must be able to burn fat for fuel, and this is an ability that is lost when you consume too many net carbs on a daily basis.When your body is able to burn fat for fuel, your liver creates ketones (water-soluble fats) that not only improve your glucose metabolism18 but also burn far more efficiently than carbs, thus lowering inflammation by creating fewer damaging reactive oxygen species and secondary free radicals. If your ketones are above 0.3 mmol/L, as described in the section above, you can start increasing the amount of healthy carbs back into your diet and start cyclical ketosis.To get you started, see my previous article, ""Ketogenic Diet: A Beginner's Ultimate Guide to Keto."" A far more detailed exposition on nutritional ketosis and how to implement a cyclical ketogenic diet can be found in my book, ""Fat for Fuel,"" which is the prequel to ""KetoFast.""Tip No. 5 — Increase Healthy Fats A key to making nutritional ketosis work is to replace the lost carbs with healthy fats, and knowing which fats are healthy and which ones are not is a crucial distinction here. Most people will need 60 to 85 percent of daily calories in the form of fat, but not all fats qualify. Fats to steer clear of are industrially processed vegetable oils, found in most processed foods and restaurant foods. Polyunsaturated fat found in processed vegetable oils is not harmful in and of itself, but becomes so if and when you eat too much of it, and/or when the oils degrade, which occurs during refining, processing and heating (cooking). Not only can they form trans fats if heated high enough, but they can also form cyclic aldehydes, which are even more harmful. For a run-down of the dangers associated with processed vegetable oils, see ""Top 13 Reasons to Replace Dangerous Oils With Healthy Fats."" For cooking, healthy alternatives include coconut oil, grass fed raw organic butter, organic ghee, lard, tallow and olive oil. For general eating, foods high in healthy fats include avocado, olives, coconut, raw nuts such as macadamia and pecans, seeds such as black sesame, cumin, pumpkin and hemp seeds, raw cacao butter and organic pastured egg yolks. Dairy fats found in butter, cheese and yogurt have been shown to lower your diabetes risk specifically. MCT oil is another healthy fat — just be sure to avoid taking it during partial fasting days once you've started KetoFasting, as exogenous ketones will inhibit autophagy. Tip No. 6 — Drink Plenty of Clean Pure Water Next, be sure to drink plenty of clean, purified water. Organic black coffee (meaning no milk or sugar) and tea are other healthy choices. Steer clear of all sweetened beverages, including ""diet"" drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners and fruit juices. As for how much water you need, your best bet is to use thirst and the color of your urine as a guide, along with frequency of urination.Thirst — Simply using thirst as a guide to how much water you need to drink is a simple way to help ensure your individual needs are met, day by dayColor — If your urine is a deep, dark yellow, then you are likely not drinking enough water. Light straw-colored urine is typically a sign of sufficient water intakeFrequency of urination — If your urine is scant or if you haven't urinated in many hours, that too is an indication that you're not drinking enough. Based on the results from a few different studies, a healthy person urinates on average about seven or eight times a day Tip No. 7 — Eat More Nuts and Seeds In addition to being a good source of healthy fats, nuts and seeds are also an excellent source of magnesium, which many are deficient in. Lack of magnesium may raise your risk of insulin resistance as it plays an important role in carbohydrate and glucose metabolism. Magnesium helps your body metabolize carbs and glucose properly. As noted by Today's Dietician:19""Epidemiologic data20,21 suggest that for every 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreases by approximately 15%. The few clinical studies22,23 showing efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity with magnesium supplementation have used doses between 300 and 365 mg/day."" Some of the most magnesium-rich seeds include sunflower, black sesame, black cumin, pumpkin and chia seeds. Among these, black cumin (nigella sativa) deserves special mention, as studies have shown it can help prevent both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In one study, black cumin improved glucose tolerance as efficiently as metformin.24 As a source of healthy fats, my preferences go to macadamias, pecans and walnuts, as they are high in fat while being lower in protein. Tip No. 8 — Properly Prescribed ExerciseLast but not least, you need exercise, focusing more on strength/resistance training than cardio. Research25 published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise found even a single session of moderate exercise can improve the way your body regulates glucose and reduces postprandial glucose spikes, and several studies have demonstrated the benefits of strength training for diabetes specifically.Among them is a 2017 study,26 which found strength training lowered women's risk of Type 2 diabetes by 30%. Adding aerobic exercise on top of it reduced the risk even further. Participants who performed at least 120 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, along with some form of strength training, had a 65% lower risk for Type 2 diabetes than those who did neither.Research27 published in April 2019 found a link between muscular strength and Type 2 diabetes incidence. People with mid-level muscular strength, measured using leg and bench press tests, had a 32% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to weaker cohorts, irrespective of cardiorespiratory fitness. No significant association between diabetes and upper level muscle strength was observed, however. A third example of this kind of research was published in BioMed Research International in 2013.28 This review also investigated the mechanisms of how exercise lowers your risk of diabetes. One way by which strength training improves your glucose metabolism is by increasing glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle.GLUT4 translocation occurs as a result of muscle contraction,29 and is required for proper regulation of glucose uptake in your muscles. Strength training increases your insulin sensitivity, as lean muscle is highly sensitive to insulin,30 which helps restore metabolic flexibility.By using insulin more efficiently, your body also ends up using more glucose, leaving less to circulate in your bloodstream — hence the improvements in glucose control.31,32 ""Increased energy expenditure and excess postexercise oxygen consumption in response to resistance training may be other beneficial effects,"" the review paper33 notes.High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has also been shown to effectively reduce your risk for diabetes. In one such study,34 older overweight Type 2 diabetics improved their glucose regulation in just six HIIT sessions done over the course of two weeks.Participants performed 10 bouts of 60-second cycling at 90 percent of their maximum heart rate, interspersed with 60 seconds of rest (total time spent exercising was one hour per week). Overall, the average 24-hour blood glucose concentration was reduced from 7.6 mmol/L (± 1.0) to 6.6 mmol/L (± 0.7) following the exercise.According to the authors, ""Our findings indicate that low-volume HIIT can rapidly improve glucose control and induce adaptations in skeletal muscle that are linked to improved metabolic health in patients with Type 2 diabetes.""",https://t.co/2UZ7S8VyRi,news
"Type 2 diabetes: Foods to lower blood sugar - nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits and legumes","Type 2 diabetes is a common condition in the UK that can be caused by eating a poor diet, high in saturated fat. Left untreated, it can lead to serious, long-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, as well as damage to the nerves, kidneys, eyes and feet. Eating a healthy diet can help manage a person's blood sugar level, and as part of this, eating foods from a certain food group is recommended.Some evidence has shown fibre can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes.A study published in 2018 suggests a high fibre diet can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 20 to 30 per cent.The research noted this effect came mainly from whole grains or insoluble cereal fibre.Other studies, however, have shown a combination of insoluble and soluble fibre in the diet can be beneficial.Soluble fibre absorbs water, turning it into a gel-like substance, while insoluble fibre doesn't.Four of the best sources of fibre you should consider adding to your diet are:Vegetables and fruitsNuts and seedsWhole grainsLegumesFibre is considered an essential part of the diet, particularly for a person with diabetes.Carbohydrates with high fibre take longer to digest than those in low fibre foods, reducing the chance of a blood sugar spike.Fibre also helps a person feel fuller for longer, making them less likely to overeat (being overweight is a risk factor for the condition developing).Government guidelines published in July 2015 say dietary fibre intake should be 30g a day, as part of a healthy balanced diet.But it was revealed most adults are only eating an average of about 18g a day.The NHS recommends the following ways to increase your fibre intake:Choose a higher-fibre breakfast cereal such as plain wholewheat biscuits (like Weetabix) or plain shredded whole grain (like Shredded wheat), or porridge as oats are also a good source of fibre.Go for wholemeal or granary breads, or higher fibre white bread, and choose wholegrains like wholewheat pasta, bulgur wheat or brown rice.Go for potatoes with their skins on, such as a baked potato or boiled new potatoes. Find out more about starchy foods and carbohydrates.Add pulses like beans, lentils or chickpeas to stews, curries and salads.Include plenty of vegetables with meals, either as a side dish or added to sauces, stews or curries.Have some fresh or dried fruit, or fruit canned in natural juice for dessert. Because dried fruit is sticky, it can increase the risk of tooth decay, so it's better if it is only eaten as part of a meal, rather than as a between-meal snack.For snacks, try fresh fruit, vegetable sticks, rye crackers, oatcakes and unsalted nuts or seeds.Some experts recommended certain supplements to control and prevent type 2 diabetes.",https://t.co/G6jx392OE2,news
4 Common Maltitol Side Effects,"4 Common Maltitol Side Effects Maltitol side effects include a variety of digestive problems including diarrhea, gas, and abdominal discomfort. A lot of people want to decrease their sugar intake, and with good reason; too much sugar can increase your chances of dementia, contribute to osteoporosis, and more. But are artificial sweeteners the way to go?There are a multitude of alternatives to sugar, including stevia, agave, coconut sugar, and artificial sweeteners.The most commonly used artificial sweeteners used commercially are sugar alcohols, like xylitol and maltitol. But before you eat too many of these sugar-free products, you should be aware of the side effects.What Is Maltitol?Maltitol is a sugar alcohol. It is about 90 percent as sweet as sugar but contains a little over half of the calories. It also has a lower glycemic index than sugar, so it may be preferable for preventing blood sugar spikes. It is considered non-digestible, which means that bacteria in the mouth cannot metabolize it, helping protect against dental caries.[1]Do you want to eat foods that help you feel better, stay slim, and avoid diet-related diseases? Do you want to be healthier by eating delicious ""super"" foods?If so, claim your FREE copy, right now, of the definitive nutrition guide on living a longer, healthier, happier life.What Foods Contain Maltitol?Maltitol can be found in sugar-free sweets like gum, chocolate, ice cream, and baked goods. It also can be found in gelatin capsules, and so can be an ingredient in many supplements.Maltitol Side EffectsWhile maltitol does have some advantages over table sugar, such as a lower caloric value and glycemic index, it is not completely safe to consume in large amounts. Consumption is associated with a variety of digestive disturbances.One study compared products containing regular sugar and those containing maltitol. They found that after eating the products with maltitol, participants in the study reported significantly higher gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal discomfort, flatulence (gas), and bloating.[2]Other maltitol dangers include diarrhea; maltitol is considered a laxative when consumed in large amounts and is associated with frequent diarrhea.[1,3]Alternative OptionsAlthough maltitol can be safe to eat in small amounts, there are many other alternative sweeteners you can try instead if you want to reduce your sugar intake while avoiding gastrointestinal symptoms at the same time.Try these in your next recipe and see how you like them:DatesCoconut sugarAgaveBrown rice syrupSteviaShare Your ExperienceWe personally like coconut sugar in place of brown sugar, and agave or brown rice syrup in recipes like rice crispy treats (try this recipe for Crisped Rice Bird's Nests).

Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?,"Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Raspberries are a delicious fruit that has been widely consumed for thousands of years. They are packed full of vitamins, minerals, and powerful antioxidants that may help prevent disease and promote health. Various studies have shown that the fruit holds a plethora of health benefits, ranging from improving cardiovascular health to preventing cancer. Raspberries are also found to be beneficial in preventing as well as managing type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that the fruit may also aid weight loss.Type 2 diabetes is a chronic health condition that causes the level of blood sugar (glucose) to rise. Over time, high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, can affect your health from head to toe, resulting in a number of complications, including heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, eye damage, etc. By keeping your blood sugar under control, you can avoid all these health problems. Eating a diet high in fibre can help keep blood sugar level stable. Raspberries boast of many nutrients, including fibre, despite being low in calories, making them a great food for diabetics.How can raspberries help prevent or treat type 2 diabetes?Previous studies have shown that consuming a high-fibre diet can help improve blood glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in type 2 diabetes. Two new studies, published in Obesity and Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, suggested that eating raspberries can significantly help prevent and manage diabetes.The first study, which investigated people with 'pre-diabetes' and insulin resistance, found that eating raspberries for breakfast can help reduce glucose levels two hours later. Likewise, the second study reported that eating berries were associated with lower blood sugar levels. The results from these trials suggested that raspberry consumption could be an important dietary component for people at risk of type-2 diabetes.Also, one study found that red raspberries have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolism-stabilising properties, all of which can help reduce the risk of several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study conducted at the Centre for Nutrition Research, Institute for Food Safety and Health, Illinois Institute of Technology, also found that red raspberries contain components that can also reduce heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, the two common complications of diabetes. The research was published in Advances in Nutrition.Other health benefits of raspberriesStudies have shown that fibre and water content in raspberries may help prevent and treat constipation, aiding in maintaining a healthy digestive tract. It's worth noting that increasing fibre intake has also been linked to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as boost weight loss.The bottom line is that eating low-calorie, high-nutrient foods like raspberries as part of a healthy diet may help manage diabetes, support weight loss, and boost health. Just ensure that the fruit you bought is organic to reduce your risk of exposure to pesticides.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Need to check your blood sugar results or see a doctor? Just ask Alexa,"Need to check your blood sugar results or see a doctor? Just ask AlexaThe multitrillion-dollar health care industry is one hell of a market, especially with well over 70 million baby boomers hitting an age when health care is a necessity, not to mention 80 million millensnial who are finally getting around to having kids. So, it makes sense that Amazon, which has been investing heavily in experimental health care projects and trials of its signature smart speaker in hospitals, would start creating HIPAA-compliant medical skills for its voice assistant, Alexa.HIPAA stands for the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which has two main purposes: First, to provide continuous health insurance coverage for workers who lose or change their jobs and, more importantly to Amazon, to standardize the electronic transmission of administrative and financial transactions.Amazon ran a trial of smart speakers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the last year, acquired online pharmacy PillPack for millions of dollars, and commanded its flagship division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to expand its HIPAA-compliant abilities.There are some hurdles for companies to jump through to get on Alexa's health care platform, but a bunch of big companies have a huge start. Amazon launched a site that enables companies to describe the health care skills they have in mind, giving Amazon a platform by which to vet the developers who want to apply to the program.The program has launched with six new Alexa health care skills from major providers, payors, pharmacy benefit managers, and digital health coaching companies. The biggest is probably Cigna Health, whose users can command Alexa to ask Cigna Health Today for a daily tip.""With our industry-leading voice skills, we are meeting customers where they are — in their homes, in their cars — and making it simpler to create healthier habits and daily routines. Through our Amazon Alexa skill, customers can simply use voice to understand the full range of their health benefits and receive personalized wellness incentives for meeting their health goals, empowering them to take control of their total health,"" said Stephen Cassell, senior vice president of Global Brand and Customer Communications for Cigna in Amazon's release.Other commands include the ability to ask Express Scripts where your order is, schedule an urgent care appointment with Swedish Health, book an appointment in the Carolinas with Atrium Health, or check blood sugar results with Livongo.Editors' RecommendationsPublished at Wed, 10 Apr 2019 21:45:00 +0000Like this:Like Loading...Related",https://t.co/UvyBLJK6D0,news
12 Signs Your Blood Sugar Is Out Of Whack,"Blood sugar, or glucose, is one of the best things Mother Nature ever provided us with. It's one component of your body chemistry that helps you feel alive and happy.When glucose is at the right level, you're likely to experience a great attitude, a strong immune system, low stress, and a good night's sleep as well. But when blood sugar gets too high, then ""crashes,"" or falls very low, the effects can be devastating to bodily processes.For this reason, the body strives to maintain blood sugar levels within a narrow range through the coordinated efforts of several glands and their hormones.Understanding Blood Sugar ControlAfter you eat a meal, the sugars in each of the foods you eat raises the level of sugar in your blood. The body responds by secreting insulin — a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by increasing the rate at which glucose is taken up by cells throughout the body.If you go too long without eating, or eat the wrong (read: ""junk"") foods, or if your hormones are out of balance, your blood sugar will fall too low. When this happens, your adrenal glands will release adrenalin and cortisol in order to remedy the situation. At this point, you should eat food that will slowly and gradually raise your blood sugar levels again.Most of the time, eating three square meals a day keeps your blood sugar in balance. But when this process gets out of whack, you can find yourself on the blood sugar roller coaster, with no one at the brake switch.How do you know if you're holding a ticket to this invisible junk food ride?12 Signs Your Blood Sugar Is Out Of Control1. Your waist is larger than your hips.2. You find it difficult to lose weight.3. You crave sweets.4. You feel infinitely better after you eat.5. You get irritable if you miss a meal.6. You cry for no reason.7. You feel a bit spacey and disconnected.8. You get anxious for no apparent reason.9. You wake up frequently during the night.10. You feel hungry all the time.11. You get very sleepy in the afternoon.12. You've been tested and have elevated blood sugar or triglyceride levels.If you find you have most of these signs, you probably need to see a doctor about your blood sugar. There are a number of natural solutions that can help stabilize your blood sugar. Start to address the problem by changing your diet. Rapidly fluctuating blood sugar levels are generally a result of more-than-moderate consumption of foods with a high content of refined or simple sugars.Eat To Control Your Blood SugarIt's important to avoid foods that cause a rapid rise in blood sugar levels. One useful tool that tells us what foods to avoid or eat in moderation is the glycemic index (GI). It's a numerical scale used to indicate how fast and how high a particular food raises blood sugar levels compared to glucose. Refined sugars, white flour products, and other sources of simple carbohydrates and sugars are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, causing a rapid rise in blood sugar and severely stressing blood sugar control. So it's important to avoid ""junk food"" and pay attention to the glycemic index of food that you eat.Best and Worst Foods to Control Blood SugarHere is a simple list of foods you probably already eat and how they affect you in terms of blood sugar, based on the glycemic index (GI) scores. These ""natural"" sugars can also keep you strapped to the roller coaster if you don't know how to manage them.Foods that have a very high glycemic score should be consumed in moderation or avoided. These include refined sugar, rice cakes, and granola.The following foods have high scores, but not quite as high: white bread, carrots, corn, kidney beans, bran muffins, potatoes, white rice, bananas, raisins, and beets. Keep these to a minimum.Foods that are medium on the glycemic index include sweet fruits such as grapes, peaches, pineapple, oranges, and melons. Starchy foods that have medium glycemic scores include brown rice, pasta, oatmeal, yams, and peas. Eat these when you need energy, but don't overdo it.If you want to eat foods that keep your blood sugar humming at a nice steady rate, eat foods with a low glycemic score: apples, apricots, cherries, grapefruit, asparagus, broccoli, celery, lentils, nuts, and seeds.",https://t.co/ahcQ75tetT,news
Hvordan Prebiotica kan hjelpe den med diabetes,"AnsvarsfraskrivelseInformasjonen på denne nettsiden er IKKE ment å diagnostisere, behandle, kurere eller forebygge noen sykdom eller tilstand. Rådfør deg alltid med lege eller kvalifisert helsepersonell før du foretar betydelige endringer i kostholdet ditt.CRO sorze4 ASMaster of Science, Ernæring, overvekt og spiseforstyrrelser,Claudia Renata Peres Münch-Yttereng IntroduksjonDiabetes mellitus er en type metabolsk lidelse der pasientene ikke er i stand til å regulere glycemia. Det er i dag et verdensomspennende folkehelseproblem og er en byrde for samfunnet på grunn av sin deaktivering og vanlige komplikasjoner. Diabetes er multifaktoriell, og også induserer utbruddet av andre sykdommer. Denlidelser demonstrert i form økte nivåer av sukker for en betydelig lang periode. Økt sult, økt tørst og hyppig vannlating enre noen av symptomene. En rekke komplikasjoner kan være konsekvensen Hvis symptomene ikke anses seriøst. I ekstreme tilfeller kan amputasjon av føtter eller ben være nødvendig. Akutte eller kort tids komplikasjoner inkluderer hyperosmolar hyperglykemiske statlige ketoacidose og/eller død. Skade på øyne, hjerneslag, hjerte-og karsykdommer og foten magesår er blant de kroniske eller langsiktige komplikasjoner. To forhold kan forårsake diabetes. En er når bukspyttkjertelen er ikke produserer insulin i nødvenige mengder. En annen er typen der hvord den insulin som produseres ikke kan brukes som det skal undernormale forhold. Diabetes kan klassifiseres i tre typer.Type 1I denne typen diabetes er bukspyttkjertelen ikke i stand til å produsere den nødvendige mengden insulin. Dette er på grunn av tap, eller mangel av beta celler. Årsaken til denne diabetes er ukjent. Denne typen diabetes er også referert til som Juvenil diabetes.Type 2I denne typen diabetes, også kalt livsstils diabetes, vil cellene i kroppen ikke respondere riktig på insulinen bukspyttkjertelen produserer. Dette fenomenet kalles insulinresistens. En insulin mangel kan utvikles ved progresjon av denne tilstanden. Tidligere var denne typen diabetes kjent som ikke-insulin-avhengig diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Utilstrekkelig mosjon og økt kroppsvekt sies å være de to viktigste årsakene til denne typen diabetes, selv om noen undersøkelser kan tyde på at overvekt, insulinresistens og høyt blodsukkernivå kan være forårsaket av en ugunstig bakterieflora i tarmen. Fedme har blitt tilskrevet å øke risikoen for multifaktorielle sykdommer, slik som type 2 diabetes. Nylig ble det rapportert at type 2 diabetes hos mennesker også var relatert til en senket nivå av butyrate-produserende mikrober og et økt nivå av Lactobacillus[1]SvangerskapsdiabetesDette er en tilstand der høyt blodsukker utvikles under svangerskapet. Vanligvis forsvinner problemet etter fødselen. Det kan oppstå på ethvert stadium av svangerskapet, men er mer vanlig i andre halvdel. Det oppstår hvis kroppen ikke kan produsere nok insulin til å møte det ekstra behovet i løpet av svangerskapet. Svangerskapsdiabetes kan føre til problemer for mor og barn under og etter fødselen. Risikoen for disse problemene oppstår kan reduseres hvis de oppdages og blir godt behandlet.Behandling og forebyggingBehandling og forebygging er komplekse prosesser. Det er en felles tro, og sikkert noe som hjelper mest når den enkelte mosjonerer og opprettholder et sunt kosthold. Vedlikehold av en normal kroppsvekt, unngår røyking og/eller bruk av tobakk i annen forms er blant de vanlige anbefalingene. De som har, eller i fare for å få diabetes bør oppsøke sin lege for å sørge for at blodtrykket er innenfor normalområdet. Injeksjoner av insulin er vanligvis nødvendig i tilfeller av type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes kan ofte være kontrollert med bruk av foreskrevet medisin. Det er eller er ikke inkludert bruk av insulin. En bivirkning av noen orale medisiner og insulin kan være lavt blodsukker. Som nevnt, er svangerskapsdiabetes vanligvis løst på egen hånd etter fødselen. Hovedårsaken for å gi en slik kortfattet forklaring av diabetes er at en betydelig del av den generelle befolkningen risikerer diabetes , og det er viktig at folk har kunnskap om sykdommen.Det mest gledelige aspekt av livetSøt smak er en av de mest behagelige aspektene i livet. Imidlertid kommer denne smaken vanligvis fra en eller annen form for sukker. Vanlige sukker kan være ekstremt skadelig for diabetespasienter. Imidlertid, alternativer er søtningsmidler eller søtningsstoff. I utgangspunktet anbefales (ikke av oss) kunstig sukker brukt av diabetespasienter, for å erstatte vanlig sukker. Det finnes sukker-fri versjoner av vanlige produkter, ment for diabetikere og de som prøver å gå ned i vekt. Dette fenomenet kan også brukes som en indikator på det faktum at diabetes mellitus er en svært vanlig sykdom. Disse produktene kan brukes til å sikre at sykdommen ikke blir mer intens. Det er imidlertid økende bevis for at søtningsmidler kan ha egne helsemessige konsekvenser. Ny forskning fra USA, presentert på den årlige Experimental Biology konferansen i San Diego, viste en link med forbruk av kunstige søtningsmidler og endringer i blod markører knyttet til økt risiko for fedme og type to diabetes[2]. I økende grad tyder det på at inntak av kunstig søtetede produkter kan være forbundet med økt risiko for overvekt eller fedme, selv om dette er kontroversielt. Hvis det er sant, tyder det på at bruk av søtningsmidler ikke kjemper fedme. Forskning har antydet at forbruk av mye kunstige søtningsmidler gir næring til uønskede bakteriene i tarmen vår, Noe som resulterer i at kroppen blir mindre tolerant for glukose som er 50% av vanlig sukker.Biologiske virkninger av søtningsmidlerDen nye forskningen, fra Medical College of Wisconsin og Marquette University, så på noen biologiske effekter av søtningsmidler i rotter og i cellekulturer. De ønsket å vite om kunstige søtningsmidler påvirker, og hvordan maten brukes og lagres. Dette kalles metabolske endringer og forskningen kombinerte mange ulike aspekter av stoffskiftet å danne et helhetlig bilde. Teamet så også på virkningen av søtningsmidler på blodårer ved å studere hvordan disse stoffene påvirker cellene som danner den indre laget i blodkar. Forskerne ga rotter mat som var høy på enten sukker (glukose eller fruktose), eller kalorifrie kunstige søtningsmidler (aspartam eller acesulfame K). Etter tre uker observerte de betydelige negative endringer i begge grupper av forsøksrotter. Disse endringene inkluderte konsentrasjoner av blod lipider (fett).Acesulfam K knyttet til fedme og diabetesDe fant at Acesulfame-K (opprinnelig en lakkfjerner) ble akkumulert i blodet og det skadet cellene i blodkarene. Forskerne bak studien sier at disse endringene er «knyttet til fedme og diabetes». Disse resultatene tyder på at forbruke av søtningsmidler kan endre hvordan kroppen behandler fett og får sin energi på cellenivå.En mer detaljert og inngående artikkel om virkningen kunstige søtstoffer har på kroppen er publisert på sorze4.comDet smaker som sukker, men er ikkeDen naturlige søtningsmiddel brukt av sorze4, i Fruity'n Sweet®, Amazon Secret®, Claudia Münch® og andre av selskapets sukker reduserte produktet er ikke sukker, og det er ikke ent ikke-næringsholdig (non-nutritive) søtningsmiddel. Det er et flott produkt hvis du har diabetes, driver vektkontroll, eller av andre grunner ønsker å kutte ned på karbohydrater, og savner smaken av ekte sukker.Vi har kalt søtningsmiddel JustSweet®. Det er som sukker, men det er ikke (du leste det riktig). Det er et søtningsmiddel som kan benyttes i nesten hvilken som helst mat som erstatning for sukker og for å forbedre eller søte smaken.Det er ikke et non-nutritive søtningsmiddel. Det har karbohydrater, men alle karbohydrater er ikke laget like. JustSweet inneholder et prebiotisk kostfiber som er karbohydratene (2 kcal per gram).Ny forskning tyder på at kostfiber spiller en avgjørende rolle når det kommer til å mate billioner av mikrober som ligger i kroppen vår. Et kollektivt kjent som mikrobiomet, som spesielt for personer med type 2 diabetes, med en høy-fiber diett sammen med en gunstig gut mikrobiomet kan holde pasientens blodsukker og kroppsvekt under kontroll. Forskere i Kina var i stand til å finne den spesifikke «gode» bakterier som bryter ned fiber til syrer, og til slutt forbedrer insulin reguleringen.[3]Forbedrer mikrobiometDen som spiser 1 g JustSweet per dag, i 4 uker, vil gi få 6 ganger mer av de gode bakteriene. I våre prebiotiske drikkevarer er det per 250 ml deilige søte smaker og naturlige vitaminer også 1 gram prebiotisk fiber.KonklusjonProdukter fra sorze4 er ikke laget for å kurere, eller forhindre sykdom eller noen tilstand, men ved en tilfeldighet er det slik at det perfekte søtningsmiddel kommer med noen «gratis» fordeler for de som ønsker å senke kaloriinntaket, eller redusere inntaket av sukker, av ulike årsaker.Journal of diabetes Investigation, 2018 januar ↑Uavhengig ↑Vitenskap ↑",https://t.co/IRfGWInkN8,news
Apple's Working on a Sensor That Can 'Smell' Your Blood Sugar Levels,"Apple's various devices already sport advanced health sensors, but a couple of recent patent applications suggest that the company is looking into even more health-related technology.The patent applications were published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday. And they suggest more advanced health sensors could be coming to future iPhone and Apple Watch products. Here's what you should know.Air Pollution SensorThe first of the two patents, ""Compact Particulate Material Sensor,"" details a system that can essentially detect air pollution.More specifically, it details a couple of possible solutions that could be used by a consumer device to detect particulate matter in the air.The first solution relies on a pulsing light source and a series of photodetectors, while the second solution entails an electric circuit that could be set to ""reject"" background light.Apple suggests that these sensors could be used to alert users to fine particulate matter in the air, otherwise known as pollution. That includes matter that's invisible unless in high densities, but could nevertheless cause respiratory issues if inhaled.Low Blood Sugar DetectionThe second patent application, ""Systems and Methods for Environment Sensing,"" is arguably the more interesting of the two. Put in the simplest way possible, the patent describes a system that could detect chemicals in the air.Like the first patent, this could prove useful for ambient environment sensing. A consumer device could detect dangerous chemicals in an environment and alert its user — essentially serving as a digital canary in a coal mine.But Apple suggests it could go beyond safety applications, claiming that the system could use sensors to detect smells tied to certain ""chemical species."" If this data is fed into a machine learning algorithm, the patent contends that it could be used for ""smell recognition capabilities.""The system would use ionic liquid sensors embedded on a chip. These sensors could detect specific chemicals in the air, as well as how much of it is present.Apple goes so far as to say that the system could be used to ""spoiled food material detection"" or ""body odor detection."" Yes, an iPhone that can tell if your food has gone bad or whether you forgot to put on deodorant.But the patent also suggests that it could be used for health applications. One example is ""smelling"" a user's sweat to determine if their blood sugar is low. That could allow for non-invasive glucose monitoring, something that Apple is already rumored to be working on.Apple's Health AmbitionsThese patents would be much less interesting if it wasn't for Apple's clear ambitions in the health and wellness sector.The Apple Watch and iPhone both have a suite of health-related sensors and features. They can track various health metrics and make them easier for users to understand. The Apple Watch even has an established reputation for saving lives.That's not even considering platforms like CareKit and ResearchKit, Apple's first-of-its-kind Apple Watch study in partnership with Stanford, or its more miscellaneous health-based endeavors.In other words, it seems clear that Apple has big ambitions for the health sphere. And while patent applications aren't a good indication of Apple's future plans, these two particular patents seem like they line up perfectly with Apple's broader goal for health.",https://t.co/3NcffwTuLC,news

Four Manthras to balance your blood sugar level,"If you have diabetes, you are not alone. Today millions of people around the world have diabetes. Healthy leaving is the costliest thing in today's world. Unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, heredity, Obesity are the main important reasons for diabetes.Most importantly lot many younger people have type 2 diabetes. This is like a slow poison which decreases the functionality of heart, kidneys, and lungs over a period of time. There are around 7.1 million people who are undiagnosed and have no idea about the sugar level changes in their body. It is everyone's responsibility to create awareness about Diabetes symptoms, cause, precautions and how to balance blood sugar level.Diabetes is a lifelong journey. Once it gets hold of you then you have to maintain it for a lifetime. This needs a lot of patience, energy, understanding, and willpower. It is a lifelong commitment hence it's not easy at all. But look it from a different point of view; early stage diagnosis will help you to lead a healthier life compared to other healthy people. How? Because others don't even have an idea about future health issues. Now is better than later right?These are the four steps which you need to follow regularly to maintain blood sugar level. Make a routine, follow these steps then Bingo! You can lead a normal life like others. 1) Healthy eatingDefinition of Healthy eating is balancing between what, how much and when you eat. It is important for everyone, but it's more important for people with diabetes. Some people consult dieticians for the proper diet plan. Don't ban any of the food items, instead limit the quantity and control appetite with the food which makes you full with a smaller quantity.Since you are avoiding carbs, include a wide variety of food such as green vegetables, whole grains, fruits etc. If you have a weekly diet plan, Include a variety of foods so that you enjoy what you eat. Don't be too strict on yourself. Start with one or two changes and then add another change. Following a diet regime helps to manage weight, keeps blood sugar within your goal range, maintains blood cholesterol &amp; blood fat levels.These steps will help you with healthy eatingDon't be hungry for a longer time: whenever we are hungry our body produces more glucose to keep up the energy. This will result in blood sugar level spike. Never let your body suffer from hunger. It is also very important to break your fasting early morning with a healthy breakfast.Finish dinner before 8 PM: You might have come across the name 'Dawn phenomenon'. This generally happens to everyone between 4 am to 8 am. People with Diabetes majorly notice this because of the high blood sugar level in the early morning. According to this phenomenon, our body produces glucagon &amp; insulin between 4 am to 8 am. Pancreas in Diabetic patients produces less insulin and more glucagon which is the main reason for sugar level hike. In order to avoid this, have early dinner and after that go for a small walk to engage your body in some sort of physical exercise.Don't eat added sugars: When you eat added sugar, it directly goes into blood resulting in sugar spike. It is best if you completely stop added sugars intake. Before buying any eatables check the quantity of sugar. Donuts, cakes, muffins, chocolates, icecreams etc are prepared with heavy amount of added sugar. It is better to avoid all these to maintain a balanced sugar level.Minimize carbs intake: Carbs as in carbohydrates can cause a sudden increase in blood sugar level. Not only blood sugar these also cause extra fat accumulation in the body. Oatmeals, Rice, Raisins, Bread, Kidney beans, Orange, Dairy products, Fries, Potato, Pasta are some of the carb-rich products.Eat in chunks: Normal person daily has breakfast, lunch &amp; supper. Being diabetic reduce the quantity of food and make a practice of eating in intervals. 9 am breakfast, 11 am snacks like sprouts, 1 pm lunch, 4 pm coffee/tea with biscuits, 7 pm supper &amp; 9 pm small quantity of yogurt or half banana should be good. Having a lesser quantity of food gives body time to absorb and thus maintaining the blood sugar level.2) Being ActivePhysical activity is very important to control the blood sugar level. The more you exercise the more Insulin is produced in the body. Daily exercise helps you to reduce medicine dosage. Exercise improves heart health, strengthens muscles &amp; bones, refreshes mind and body, relieves stress and helps to maintain a healthy lifestyle.If you cannot jog or run every day start walking for a smaller distance then gradually increase. Exercise can be swimming, dancing or anything that keeps your body active. American Diabetes Association recommends being active for at least 150 minutes a week, spread over at least 3 days a week.check your blood sugar level before and after your activity. If you are not feeling well, feeling low in energy then stop immediately. Make sure your feet are protected while exercising. Wear comfortable socks and proper shoes for the particular activity.How to be active?Change exercise: Diabetes is a daily hassle. If you are going to gym or any other alternative for a month it might bore you after few days. It needs constant inspiration to get up from the couch and exercise every day. Instead, try to change the exercising methods. Cycling is the best option to engage yourself happily. During summers jog early morning to feel fresh for the whole day.Keep walking: Most of us have 8 hours job to sit in front of computers. It is not recommended to be idle for a longer time. Often take small green tea breaks to loosen yourself and walk for 5 minutes.Don't stop: If you cannot go to gym or cycling at least go for a long walk. Exercise is the main key to insulin production for type 2 diabetes.3) MedicineKeeping track of your diabetes medicine is one of the most important steps. Also, it is important to have regular checkups with your doctor.Schedule a regular visit, A1c test, Blood pressure check, weight and foot check for every 3 months. Check with your doctor about medicine. A1C test &amp; Dental exam are mandatory for every 6 months.Physical exam, foot exam, Blood fat &amp; cholesterol levels, Kidney tests, Dilated eye exam, Flu shot, Insulin generation are some of the important annual checkups. Few home remediesApple cider Vinegar: ACV is proven as the best solution for insulin production. This also reduces fat in the body. Dilute 2 tablespoons of ACV in distilled water and drink it once a day.Cinnamon: Studies shows that taking 2-3 tablespoons of cinnamon every day have resulted in better insulin production. If you cannot take it directly mix it along with your food.Fenugreek: Person who took fenugreek continuously for 6 months has brought down A1C from 12 to 8! Every morning mix fenugreek powder in warm water and have it like tea.4) Monitoring your blood sugarMaintain a diary to note down the details. Note time, sugar level, medicine, extra details like if there is any alteration in your diet plan. Monitoring your blood sugar tells you; whether your insulin or other medicines are working effectively or not. Monitoring before and after food intake shows variation in blood sugar level based on calories. Avoid the food which is resulting in blood sugar level hike.You will feel better and have more energy when your blood sugar stays at or near normal. There are a variety of blood sugar meters, your doctor can help you choose the suitable meter and show you how to use it.Like this:Like Loading...Related",https://t.co/ilWD4Y4NXw,news
Can you drink coffee if you have type 2 diabetes? How caffeine affects blood sugar levels,"Can you drink coffee if you have type 2 diabetes? How caffeine affects blood sugar levels&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Type 2 diabetes can cause a wide range of symptoms, including excessive thirst and hunger, fatigue, frequent urination, weight loss, blurry vision, etc. This condition causes blood sugar levels to rise higher than normal and lead to serious complications if left untreated or not managed well. A healthy lifestyle, which consists of a balanced diet and exercise, can help stabilise blood sugar in most patients. However, certain foods and drinks can have blood sugar-lowering properties, and research suggests that coffee may help lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Once condemned as bad for your health, coffee has remarkably gained limelight in recent years owing to its potential health benefits. Yet, growing evidence shows that coffee may help prevent or reduce the risk of certain cancers, liver disease, cardiovascular problems, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and aid weight loss.Coffee for type 2 diabetes: Does it really work and how does caffeine affect your blood sugar?Studies on the health benefits of coffee for type 2 diabetes have shown different results. This could be due to the fact that coffee contains different compounds, some of which have beneficial effects, while others can be unhelpful for blood sugar levels - such as caffeine which can impair both glucose and insulin levels.For instance, a 2012 study reported that drinking 2-3 cups of coffee per day may help reduce the risk of diabetes. The researchers also found that regularly drinking 4 cups of coffee a day could lower blood sugar - both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees showed the same results, as per this study. Also, a 2009 study of 40,000 participants showed that taking 3 cups of tea or coffee per day caused a 40% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.However, it may be noted that exceeding four cups of coffee a day may increase your blood pressure. Moreover, it's worth noting that coffee or tea should not be used as your main source of fluid, instead, you can include it as part of a balanced diet.Researchers also found a link between caffeine and blood sugar levels. A 2004 study showed that taking caffeine before eating caused higher post-meal blood sugar in type 2 diabetes patients. It also led to an increase in insulin resistance. a recent 2018 study, there may be a genetic proponent involved. A 2018 study suggested that genes may play a role in caffeine metabolism and how it affects blood sugar levels.Additionally, coffee has been shown to offer many health benefits that aren't linked to diabetes prevention.Tips for adding coffee to your dietIt may not be a healthy option to start drinking coffee to help prevent or manage diabetes, although there's growing evidence suggesting that the ingredient could be beneficial. Adding coffee to your diet as part of a healthy eating plan may be good, especially if you already drink it. But make sure that you reduce the amount of sugar or milk you consume with your coffee.If you have type 2 diabetes or are at risk of developing the condition, you should focus on making healthier lifestyle choices such as eating a balanced diet consisting of fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, exercising and losing weight. Also, consult your doctor or a dietician about diet options and the potential effects that coffee can have on you.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Diabetes Blood Sugar Levels Chart [Printable],"JUMP TO: Intro | Blood sugar vs blood glucose | Diagnostic levels | Blood sugar goals for people with type 2 diabetes | Visual chart | Commonly asked questions about blood sugarBefore Getting StartedI was talking to one of my clients recently about the importance of getting blood sugar levels under control.So before sharing the diabetes blood sugar levels chart, I want to OVER EMPHASIZE the importance of you gaining the best control of your blood sugar levels as you possibly can. Just taking medication and doing nothing else is really not enough.You see, I just don't think many people are fully informed about why it is so crucial to do, because if you already have a diabetes diagnosis then you are already at high risk for heart disease and other vascular problems.Maybe you've been better informed by your doctor but many people I come across haven't. So if that's you, it's important to know that during your pre-diabetic period, there is a lot of damage that is already done to the vascular system. This occurs due to the higher-than-normal blood sugar, that's what causes the damage.So now that you have type 2 diabetes, you want to prevent any of the nasty complications by gaining good control over your levels.Truly, ask anyone having to live with diabetes complications and they'll tell you it's the pits!You DO NOT want it to happen to you if you can avoid it.While medications may be needed, just taking medication alone and doing nothing is really not enough!Why is it not enough even if your blood sugars seem reasonably under control?Well, one common research observation in people with diabetes, is there is a slow and declining progression of blood sugar control and symptoms. Meaning, over time your ability to regulate sugars and keep healthy gets harder. If you take medication you will likely have to take more and more.BUT, if you empower yourself with the right nutrition and lifestyle and put scientifically proven strategies into practice, then you can eliminate or minimize medications, and prevent this gradual decline. In many cases, people are even putting their diabetes into full remission – meaning their body is functioning as normal – it is possible, in many.Leisa lowered blood sugar from 300s to normal in just 30 days.Let us show you how &gt;&gt;""Not only are my readings now within normal range, I'm also down over 20 pounds and feeling so much better. Thank you. Now that you understand just how important this is, let's get down to blood sugar numbers and target ranges. And at the bottom of this page, you can download printable blood sugar levels charts and daily logs.Blood Sugar/Blood Glucose = Same/SameYou might see some charts or read some articles that say 'blood sugar chart' and others that say 'blood glucose levels chart.'Just in case you are confused these both mean the same thing. The words 'sugar' and 'glucose' are often used interchangeably.Let's Crunch Some NumbersI'll give these numbers to you in a written, chart, and visual format because it will make sense to you depending how you read it.Depending where you live in the world, numbers can vary slightly. And your numbers will either be mg/dl or mmol/l. You'll find the numbers for both of these readings below.Normal Blood Sugar LevelsFasting glucose â€"" 70-99 mg/dl or 4-6 mmol/l (Note: there is some debate about the normal range in mmol/l, ranging from 5.5 to 6 mmol/l)2 hours post meal glucose – Less than 140 mg/dl or less than 7.8 mmol/lPre-diabetes â€"" also called impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose toleranceFasting glucose â€"" 100-125 mg/dl or 6.1-6.9 mmol/l2 hours post meal glucose level â€"" 140-199 mg/ dl or 7.8-11 mmol/lDiabetesFasting glucose â€"" More than 126 mg/dl or more than 7.0 mmol/l2 hours glucose level â€"" More than 200 mg/dl or more than 11.1 mmol/lBlood Sugar Levels ChartThe above chart and the one below are exactly the same, in different formats.CategoryFasting valuePost prandial / aka post mealÂ MinimumMaximum2 hours after mealNormal70 mg/dl99 mg/dlLess than 140 mg/dlÂ 4 mmol/l6 mmol/lLess than 7.8 mmol/lPre-diabetes100 mg/dl125 mg/dl140-199 mg/dlÂ 6.1 mmol/l6.9 mmol/l7.8-11 mmol/lDiabetesMore than 126 mg/dlÂ More than 200Â More than 7 mmol/lÂ More than 11.1 mmol/lThese are the diagnostic ranges. As you can see, the ""normal"" range for fasting glucose is under 100 mg/dl or 6 mmol/l. Though just to note,Â there is some debate about the normal range in mmol/l, ranging from 5.5 to 6 mmol/l. So depending what chart you look at, you may see either of those numbers.After a meal, the maximum reading you ideally want to see is 140 or 7.8.If you're getting readings above this, you would be diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, as shown in the charts above. Back to topDiabetes Blood Sugar Level GoalsUpon waking before breakfast (Fasting)70-130 (Ideal under 110) mg/dl4-7.2 (Ideal under under 6.1) mmol/lTwo hours after mealsUnder 180 (Ideal is under 140) mg/dlUnder 10 (Ideal is under 7.8) mmol/lBedtimeThe above levels, for people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, are the general goals set by the AmericanÂ Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.As suggested earlier, there is some variation in the blood sugar levels goals set by different organizations. And additionally, your physician or healthcare team may set your goals at a more stringent level.For instance, fasting levels:Between 70-100 mg/dL or 4-5.6 mmol/l (optimal)70-110 mg/dL orÂ 4-6 mmol/l (still good control)70-130 mg/dL or 4-7.2 mmol/l (more liberal, but realistic for many)Once you have a type 2 diabetes diagnosis, the overall goals you should aim for is to get your blood sugar levels as close to ""normal"" ""optimal"" levels as you possibly can.BUT, as suggested above, often goals are set with higher targets initially. For instance, if you have a high reading of 250 or 300 (13 or 17), your physician or health practitioner may recommend 200 (11.1) be an initial goal, then 180 (10), before gradually working toward 140 (7.8) and lower.The reason this is often recommended is you can experience symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) if you bring your levels down very quickly. So working toward tighter and tighter control does take some time.You should work with your healthcare team on this. But overall the most optimal targets to work toward are a fasting glucose under 100 mg/dl or 6 mmol/l. And an after-meal reading below 140 or 7.8.The Visual VersionPlease pin, tweet or share this chart to help others – thanks!Back to topCommonly Asked Questions About Blood Sugar LevelsWhat is the difference between blood sugar and A1c?Blood sugar is a daily reading while A1c is a blood test that measures your average blood sugar from the previous 3 month period.You can read more about the difference between the two over here.Will weight loss help with my diabetes management?Yes, by default weight loss helps because it reduces inflammation in your body and improves overall metabolic function. However, weight loss alone won't lower blood sugar levels. You often have to make several diet and lifestyle changes to bring your levels within normal range.I've been prescribed Metformin, will that help with my blood glucose levels?Yes, Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed diabetes medications worldwide. It belongs to a class of medications known as ""Biguanides, which lower blood glucose by decreasing the amount of sugar put out by the liver. And it is one of the medications that does not increase weight gain.We have detailed information about Metformin here.Why does high blood sugar cause complications like neuropathy?The body is designed to have a blood sugar level within a certain range, with a maximum of 140 (7.8) after meals. Levels above normal for extended periods promote inflammation in the blood vessels throughout the body, along with damage to cells – simply because the body isn't designed to operate with levels above normal.Diabetic neuropathy is damage to the nerve vessels resulting from chronically high blood sugar – meaning long-term, not a few high readings now and then. Other types of diabetes complicationsÂ (nephropathy, retinopathy, etc) are also caused by the same factors.What type of diet helps to lower blood sugar levels?Scientific research indicates that a low carb diet is a great dietary pattern for improving blood sugar, A1c, weight, cholesterol and other factors.Carbohydrates are the main nutrient that influences your blood sugar levels. The type is important, but the amount has the greatest impact on both daily blood glucose and A1c measurements.Read this info on starting your diet plan. You'll also find these 15 carbohydrate questions and answers useful. Is there a different blood sugar levels chart by age?No. The human body was designed to have blood sugar levels within a 'normal' range, regardless of your age.However, different blood sugar level goals are set for each individual person, particularly children and the elderly.The diabetes organization in my country lists different levels, why are these different?It can make it confusing when different organizations list different values. And unfortunately, there is no one recognized value at this point, although there should be.Here are the organization listings for some parts of the globe:American Diabetes AssociationList the normal range between 70-99 mg/dl (3.9-5.6 mmol/l).They suggest blood glucose goals for people with type 2 diabetes are:80-130 mg/dl before meals (4.4-7.2 mg/dl)Less than 180 mg/dl after meals (10 mmol/l)Diabetes AustraliaList the normal range between 4.0-7.8mmol/l.They suggest blood glucose goals for people with type 2 diabetes are:6-8 mmol/l before meals (108-144 mg/dl)6-10 mmol after meals / 108-180Â mg/dlDiabetes UKList the normal range between 4-6 mmol/l (72-108 mg/dl) when fasting. And up to 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) 2 hours after eating.They suggest blood glucose goals for people with type 2 diabetes are:4-7 mmol/l before meals (72-126 mg/dl)Under 8.5 mmol/l after meals (153 mg/dl)Diabetes CanadaLike Diabetes UK, they suggest blood glucose goals for people with type 2 diabetes are 4-7 mmol/l before meals (72-126 mg/dl).5-10 mmol/l after meals (90-180 mg/dl), or if A1c goals are not being met, it should be reduced to 5-8 mmol/lÂ (90-144 mg/dl).Hopefully we will see organizations worldwide list the same glucose readings in future so there is not such a confusion.Can these charts be used as a pre diabetes blood sugar levels chart?Yes. The charts contain the numbers for prediabetes as well. And you can use the charts to track your food intake and daily numbers, along with exercise or other notes you want to include.Is daily blood glucose monitoring recommended?If you have type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, daily self-monitoring using a blood glucose meter (which involves a simple finger-prick test), can be a great way to understand what is happening in your body so you can bring your levels under control.How often should I take a blood sugar sample?There is wide variability on how often to monitor, depending on the state of your diabetes and treatment. But, most people monitor 1-2 times daily â€"" fasting (first thing in the morning) and 2 hours after the biggest meal. For your after-meal (postprandial) blood sample, time from your first bite of food.If you're newly diagnosed or trying to gain better control, it can be helpful to monitor more frequently so you can assess your progress and work on changing diet and lifestyle habits to support your goals. One thing that is helpful with mealtimes is ""monitoring in pairs. To monitor in pairs you check your levels before, then 2 hours after a meal. It's a great way to get an indication of the effect of foods and the amount of carbs you're consuming. If you log your numbers and your daily food intake and lifestyle habits, you will soon see patterns emerging and then you can make the necessary adjustments to your dietary routine.When you download our free blood sugar chart below, we'll also provide some blood sugar logs so you can record your blood sugar readings.

"Increase Blood Platelets, Heal Ulcers And Regulate Blood Sugar Levels With Papaya Leaf Juice","​Papaya is a delicious tropical fruit, packed with numerous nutrients. This yellowish orange fleshy fruit contains lots of seeds and according to the book ""Healing Foods"" by DK Publishing House, the fruit is ""known to have antibacterial properties and promotes good digestion and almost every part of the plant can be used.""​While the fruit is high in vitamins and beta-carotene, its seeds have a sharp peppery flavor and are abundant in fatty acids and papaya oil. Yet, only a few probably knew that papaya leaves are also incredibly nutritious and can provide numerous health benefits.Just like the fruit, the leaf is high in enzymes like papain and chymopapain, which help digestion, and prevent digestive disorders, while the strong alkaloid compounds like karpain significantly improve hair health.Papaya leaves contain more than 50 ingredients, including vitamins (A, B1, C, and E), water, calories, protein, carbohydrates, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium, sodium, and manganese.Researchers have found that the phytonutrient compounds in papaya leaves act in synergy to display a powerful antioxidant and immune enhancing impact in the bloodstream. Papain, alkaloids and phenolic compounds are responsible for their positive biological effects.Therefore, papaya leaves strengthen health in various ways. First of all, these leaves increase platelet count.Platelets (thrombocytes) are blood cells which are in charge of the blood clotting process. They stick one to another when a blood vessel is damaged, and the platelet ball is strengthened with collagen, calcium, and a few other blood components.If the number of platelets is low, the body cannot stop the bleeding after any damage. The normal range of platelets is 150 to 450 thousand cells per microliter of blood, and everything below 150 thousand cells is considered a low platelet count.The most common causes of low platelet count include vitamin B12 deficiency, liver failure, severe dehydration, autoimmune diseases, some medications, dengue fever, and Zika virus.Most studies on the effects of papaya leaves on platelet count are done in the case of dengue fever, as the disease is widely spread in the same parts of the world where papaya is easily accessible.This tropical infection is caused by the dengue virus and transmitted by mosquitoes, and every year, 50 to 528 million people get diagnosed with it and 20 thousand people die from it. It is a self-limiting disease, but it can cause life-threatening complications, such as platelet destruction, which quickly leads to low platelet count, generalized bleeding, and death.However, a 2013 study has found that 50 ml (less than 2 ounces) of papaya leaf juice once daily for 3 days straight significantly raised the level of platelets of all 114 subjects.The following year, it was found that the use of papaya leaf juice for 5 days led to a five-five-fold increase in platelet count (from 28 to 138 thousand per microliter of blood) in a young man suffering from dengue.Also, a 2016 study showed that papaya leaf extract capsules were highly effective as well, starting from the third day of administration, and caused no side effects. Additionally, papaya leaf extracts were found to be effective in the treatment of any case of low platelets, including the dreadful immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Yet, these miraculous leaves have numerous other medicinal properties as well:-- Studies have shown that this extract can lower blood sugar, improve blood cholesterol, and boost the function of the liver and pancreas-- Being a potent antioxidant, the papaya leaf extract protects the lining of the stomach from free radical damage, heals peptic ulcers, and treats colon inflammation due to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These leaves also contain karpain, which destroys bacteria that cause problems like gastritis, while papain, protease enzyme, and amylase enzyme in their content break down proteins, carbs, and soothe the gastrointestinal (GI ) tract-- A 2008 study showed that a papaya leaf extract taken in low to moderate doses has anti-inflammatory properties, particularly in reducing joint swelling due to arthritis-- Papaya leaf juice improves insulin sensitivity, regulates blood sugar levels, lowers oxidative stress, and decreases secondary complications of diabetes like fatty liver, and kidney damage-- Vitamins A and C in papaya leaf juice improve skin health and treat a variety of skin conditions and infected cuts, burns, ringworm, bed sores, acne, rashes, bug bites-- Papaya leaf extracts protect the brain from abnormal changes in the balance of signaling molecules and might be able to treat conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases-- The extract of papaya leaf stimulates hair growth, prevent balding and thinning of hair. It is commonly added to anti-dandruff shampoos due to the presence of the karpain compound, an alkaloid component that removes dirt and oil from your scalp, and restores the shiny and vitality of the hair-- You can use this extract as a mouthwash to soothe gum inflammation and treat gum bleeding-- Papaya leaf juice eases the menstrual flow and treats the pain. Its potent healing properties balance hormones, and regulate menstruation cycles.Make sure you follow these guidelines in order to reap most of the benefits of these leaves:-- You can juice them in a juicer, and store away a small bottle of the juice in the fridge to be consumed within 4-5 days-- You can crush 10 leaves and put them in the blender with a cup of pure drinking water. Blend, and strain afterward using a cheese or muslin cloth. Note that the juice is extremely powerful and bitter, so you can start with only one tablespoon daily and work up to a maximum of two tablespoons. You should not drink water (or other fluids) immediately after.

Type 2 diabetes: Walnuts proven to lower blood sugar and reduce risk of condition,"Type 2 diabetes is a condition where a person's blood sugar (glucose) level becomes too high. It can trigger symptoms such as excessive thirst, peeing more than usual and feeling very tired. Left untreated, it can lead to long-term complications with the eyes, nerves, kidneys and feet. A healthy diet can help manage blood sugar levels, in particular eating a wide range of foods, including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta, and keeping sugar, fat and salt to a minimum.Certain foods alone have also been found to have blood sugar lowering properties - one being walnuts.The nutty snack is hailed for its healthy fatty acids content and keeping the heart healthy.People with diabetes may have a higher risk of heart disease or stroke, so it's important they get fatty acids, like those found in walnuts, through diet.A study from 2018 suggested eating walnuts is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes. One of the most prominent characteristics of nuts for people with diabetes is their effect on cholesterol levels, according to Diabetes.co.uk.It explains: ""Avoiding high cholesterol levels is essential for people with diabetes, because exposure to high blood glucose levels increases the risk of the arteries narrowing.""Almonds, peanuts, and pistachios all reduce ""bad"" cholesterol very effectively. ""Bad"" cholesterol refers to small, dense particles of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), too much of which can clog the arteries.""Almonds, walnuts, pistachios, pecans, and hazelnuts reduce ""bad"" cholesterol by increasing levels of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL), or 'good' cholesterol. HDL clears out 'bad' cholesterol, thus reducing the risk of heart disease.""Another food which has been found to lower blood sugar is the onion. A study involving 42 people with type 2 diabetes showed eating 3.5 ounces (100g) of fresh red onion reduced fasting blood sugar levels after just four hours. Additionally, a number of animal studies have shown eating onions to benefit blood sugar control.A study demonstrated that diabetic rats fed food containing 5 per cent onion extract for 28 days had decreased fasting blood sugar.Onions anti diabetic effects come from compounds such as quercetin and sulphur.Quercetin has been shown to interact with cells in the small intestine, pancreas, skeletal muscle, fat tissue and liver to control blood sugar regulation.Changes to diet isn't the only way to lower blood sugar.Alongside a healthy diet, keeping active can help manage blood sugar levels.But what types of exercise are most effective?Regular exercise is stated by the government as 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity a week.Diabetes.co.uk explained: ""Aerobic activity at moderate intensity basically means exercising at a level that raises your heart rate and makes you sweat. This includes a multitude of sports.""Here are six examples of aerobic exercise that can people with type 2 diabetes.",https://t.co/NDoSKZaWzc,news
Does including ginger in the diet help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"Does including ginger in the diet help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes? Posted by Medivizor on Apr 21, 2019 in Diabetes mellitus | In a nutshell The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ginger consumption on blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The main finding of the study was that patients who consumed ginger had improved blood sugar control.Some background Ginger is a non-toxic spice that is considered safe by the FDA. Some studies have shown ginger to be beneficial in patients with (T2D). HbA1c is a blood test that measures average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. It is a marker of blood sugar control. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) is blood sugar levels when a patient has not eaten in 8 or more hours. FBS is usually high in T2D.The effect of ginger in the diet of HbA1c and FBS in patients with T2D is still under debate.Methods &amp; findings This study analyzed results from 8 different trials. These included 454 patients with T2D overall. Patients in the trials were assigned to consume either 1600– 4000mg ginger daily or not to consume any ginger.There was no significant difference in the FBS levels of patients who consumed ginger and those that did not consume ginger. However, patients who consumed ginger had a significant improvement in their HbA1c levels. Patients who did not consume any ginger had no improvement in their HbA1c.The bottom line The authors concluded that dietary ginger did not improve FBS levels but did improve HbA1c in patients with T2D. They suggested that ginger might have an impact on blood sugar control over a longer period of time.The fine print The studies included were very small. Larger studies are needed for better evidence.What's next? If you have any concerns about T2D and diet, please consult with your doctor.Original Title :Dietary ginger as a traditional therapy for blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

"The ""Normal Blood Sugar Range"" May Be Misleading You","The ""Normal Blood Sugar Range"" May Be Misleading You Even glucose levels within the normal blood sugar range can be damaging. A fasting blood sugar test measures the amount of a type of sugar, called glucose, in your blood after you have not eaten for at least eight hours. Checking for an ideal fasting blood sugar is one of the most commonly performed tests to check for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. So what should your fasting blood sugar be?The normal blood sugar range is 65-99 mg/dL.If your fasting blood sugar is between 100 and 125 mg/dL, you have ""impaired fasting glucose,"" also referred to as ""prediabetes.""If your fasting blood sugar is more than 126 mg/dL on two or more occasions, you have full-blown diabetes.Take command of your diabetes, simplify blood sugar management, and make the most of today's breakthroughs in diabetes treatment!Claim your FREE copy, right now, of our definitive guide on diabetes.What Is Prediabetes?People defined as having impaired fasting glucose/prediabetes are individuals whose blood sugar levels do not meet criteria for diabetes, yet are higher than those considered normal. These people are at relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), prediabetes is not a disease itself but rather a risk factor ""for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease.""[1]However, the ADA also state that prediabetes can be considered an ""intermediate stage"" in the diabetes disease process.[1] (One might wonder how prediabetes can be a both a risk factor for diabetes and an intermediate stage of the diabetes disease process simultaneously).In addition to increasing the chance of developing diabetes, it's well-established that people with impaired fasting glucose/prediabetes are more likely to be overweight or obese, especially with what's known as abdominal or visceral obesity. They also are more likely to have high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.[1]Even Normal-Range Blood Glucose Levels Can Increase Diabetes RiskThere's a lot more at stake for those with prediabetes, too. Studies show that even those with fasting blood sugar levels towards the high end of the optimal glucose level may be at significantly higher risk. In fact, these cut-offs for what are considered ""normal,"" prediabetes, and diabetes blood sugar ranges are somewhat arbitrary. The truth is that blood sugar starts damaging body tissues and increasing your risk of numerous diseases even at levels lower than prediabetes levels.A panel of experts gathered by the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists confirmed this in 2008 when they reviewed all the science on prediabetes and diabetes. They found that the risks of having elevated blood sugar—including heart disease, strokes, kidney damage, nerve damage, dementia, and cancer—start at numbers much lower than those used to diagnose pre-diabetes or diabetes.[2]In other words, even if your normal fasting glucose level falls within the optimal range, you could still be damaging your heart, brain, and other tissues—and setting yourself up for diabetes symptoms down the road.What's an Optimal Glucose Level?At this point you might be wondering what constitutes an optimal fasting blood sugar range. Some studies indicate that an ideal fasting glucose level is less than 90 mg/dl and likely somewhere around 85 mg/dl.[3,4] However, the optimal fasting blood glucose level likely depends on additional factors related to blood sugar regulation. The fasting blood sugar test provides only a small amount of information regarding how your body handles sugar. There are other important tests, such as the glucose tolerance test, the insulin response test, and the Hemoglobin A1c test, which are considered by many experts to be more important indicators of prediabetes and other problems with blood sugar metabolism.What should you do if your fasting glucose is not within the normal blood sugar range?If your fasting blood sugar is above 85 or 90 mg/dl, don't panic. There is so much you can do to improve your blood sugar control. It all comes back to the basics:Adopts a diabetic diet that boosts intake of healthy foods while decreasing intake of sugar and empty carbs.Exercise regularly.Reduce stress.There are many useful natural therapies and dietary approaches for hypoglycemia and lowering blood sugar that we've covered in previous articles. For ideas, start by reading the following:This article was originally published in 2016. It is regularly updated.

Blood Sugar Management using Data Science,"Deepshree is Type-2 Diabetic. We detected this about 12 years back. Ever since, she is on Insulin. While her condition is stable and she is performing all her daily activities, it requires a lot of management to keep her condition stable. We have had a dedicated Diabetes Specialist for her since 2008.Doctor's MonitoringInitially a Doctor, who was also doing research at Bangalore Diabetes Center, used to monitor Deepshree's condition. We used to visit him every month and provide him the data we used to collect. Around 2017, we had to change her Doctor as Dr. Kashinath left Bangalore Diabetes Center. Bangalore Diabetes Center could not find a replacement for quite some time. Also, Dr. Kashinath's Clinic was very far from our house. We took a membership at Lifespan Diabetes Center. Here also, we have had a change of Doctor once. However, Lifespan maintains all the data they capture during every visit across Doctors. The data Lifespan captures includes medicines prescribed along with the dosage and the Blood Report details that we provide them on every visit. We take Deepshree's Blood Report every 3 months which includes Blood Sugar Tests and HbA1c Tests.Since around 2016, we have been taking the Blood Sugar Count of Deepshree every night before Dinner. Based on the Blood Sugar count, we decide the number of units of Insulin she takes in the night. Deepshree injects Insulin every night before Dinner.Deepshree's ActivitiesDeepshree does all the work in the house and in her office. At home, she cleans the house, takes care of our Pets – Sheru and Baghira (feeding them, cleaning their potty, combing them, etc.), cooks all 3 meals for us on almost 95% of the days, etc. At office, Deepshree generally has continuous work for 8 hours. Moreover, she works in shifts including night shifts. Earlier, her shift used to change every week. Later, her shifts would change every fortnight. At the moment, for the last 8 months, she works in Morning Shift and Afternoon Shift only. The morning shift is between 6AM to 3:00 PM. And the afternoon shift is between 2:00 PM to 11:00 PM.Very Strict Food HabitsDeepshree is very disciplined in almost all aspects of life. Especially, ever since her Diabetes was detected, she does not take any sweet. This is even if Family Members, Relatives, Friends or Colleagues insist on it. She is very strict about it. She had to be as when we detected her condition, her Blood Sugar Count is more than 500. After all these years, her Blood Sugar count is generally stable at around 150.She also generally avoid high carbohydrate containing food including Potato, etc. There are very few fruits that she takes. She totally avoid fruits like Watermelon, Custard Apple, Banana, etc. When she feels like having a fruit, she has Apples, Guavas, Papaya, Kiwi and a few others.Very recently, from about 2 years back, Deepshree takes Sugar Free Sweets and Sugar Free Ice Creams. She takes Tea or Coffee without sugar. She does not even add sugar free to Tea or Coffee. Sometimes, she takes Health Drinks like Women's Horlick, etc.Critical ConditionsIn spite of taking care, there are days when Deepshree feels severe conditions when the Blood Sugar count dips. This condition occurs at almost any point of time during the day or night. When it happens at Night, she wakes up from sleep sweating profusely. To bring the condition back to normal, she takes some form of sweet. I keep some sweet filled croissants. We have found that the quantity of Sugar in these croissants is just ideal to settle Deepshree back to normal.At Office, till date by the Grace of God, Deepshree has never had an awkward situation. However, she always carries some fruits and at least one sweet filled croissant with her. When she feels that she is uncomfortable, she eats the croissant and/or the fruits. Also, she quickly runs around to the cafeteria and eats some snacks so that the Blood Sugar increases.When Deepshree's Blood Sugar count is high, she experiences severe body pain. Though she can handle it, it does make her very uncomfortable.Keeping our own DataIn Jan 2018, I decided to capture data regarding Deepshree's Blood Sugar condition. By this time, I had been studying Data Sciences for more than 4 years. I was interested to see if I could find a way to predict the amount of Insulin Deepshree should inject so that there is no discomfort for her the next day.At the moment, we decide on the amount of Insulin based on our judgement from our past experience. The Doctors are also happy at this modus operandi. The Doctor calibrates the levels of medicines that he prescribes to Deepshree.I created a spreadsheet and started capturing the following data. Now, it is about 16 months that I have been capturing this data. However, the data set is still very small to apply Predictive Analytics on the same. However, in another 5 years time, the data should be sizeable enough to apply predictive and/or prescriptive analytics. That is the time, when Deepshree will have more need for the same as well.Here is a list of Data Items that I have been capturing.The idea is to predict the volume of Insulin to Inject.1. Date of RecordingI have been recording the Data Every Day since 01-Jan-2018.This field will be useful when designing Recurrent Neural Network for this problem to provide for Time Series Data.In normal Linear Regression or Logistic Regression, this field should have no use.2. Day of the WeekI derive this data from the Date of Recording. This was initially important as Deepshree always had holiday on Saturday and Sunday. However, for the last 1 year, Deepshree's Week-Off keeps changing.So, this Data Item can take a Data between 1 and 7, 1 being Sunday and 7 being Saturday.3. Office DayAs Deepshree's Week Off keeps changing, I maintain this data Item to record whether Deepshree had office on that day or not. This is also useful if Deepshree is on vacation.This Data Item can take only 2 values – YES if the Date of Recording was a Working Day for Deepshree and NO if the Date of Recording was not a Working Day for Deepshree.4. Blood Sugar CountThis is very critical data. As I mentioned before, we take this count every night.This is a numerical data. This data, along with the other data items, is a critical factor in forecasting what would be the Insulin Volume for the next day.5. Insulin VolumeFor the moment, this is my variable to predict. Keeping the historical values will be used for forecasting the future.The Insulin Injected on a particular day determines what the condition would be the following day or days. Sometimes when the Blood Sugar Count is very high like 250, it is not possible to inject an unusually high volume of Insulin immediately. Instead, we have to take more than normal volume of Insulin for a few days before the Blood Sugar Count comes down an acceptable level.This is a numerical data.6. Medicines TakenDeepshree is very particular about taking medicines. In spite of this, there are days, when she cannot take medicines as prescribed due to circumstances.I do not track the Medicines she takes. The Doctors, so far, have not changed her Medicines. However, the dosage has been altered from time to time.As I do not have much understanding of the Medicines, I do not track particular medicines. Instead, I just track whether the Medicines have been taken or Not.This Data Item can take only 2 values – YES if the Medicines were taken on the Date of Recording and NO if the Medicines were not taken on the Date of Recording.7. BreakfastWhat Deepshree eats for every meal plays a critical role in how her Blood Sugar Count would be. Generally, we have similar Breakfast every day. However, there are some days, when we skip Breakfast and have Brunch. Also, there are days when we buy Breakfast from Hotels. When we are on vacation, we usually have heavy Breakfast.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO BREAKFAST2 – LIGHT BREAKFAST3 – NORMAL BREAKFAST4 – HEAVY BREAKFAST8. LunchUsually Deepshree has Lunch at predefined times. However, there are days when Lunch gets delayed. This happens especially when she is in the Morning Shift. If she works on a critical issue, she cannot take time off for Lunch. This results in change in Lunch Time and sometimes also change in Lunch taken. Usually, we have Lunch made in house by Deepshree. However, when she has extra work, I get Lunch from Hotel.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO LUNCH2 – LIGHT LUNCH3 – NORMAL LUNCH4 – HEAVY LUNCH9. DinnerUsually Deepshree has Dinner at predefined times. Deepshree definitely has dinner as she has to inject Insulin in the night. Usually, we have Dinner cooked by Deepshree. However, there are days when we have Dinner in Hotels.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO DINNER2 – LIGHT DINNER3 – NORMAL DINNER4 – HEAVY DINNER10. Evening SnacksThis is a big variable. When Deepshree is on Morning Shift or on Holidays, she has Tea with some Light Snacks in the Evening. However, when she is on Afternoon Shift, this is not always possible. During the Afternoon Shift, there is no fixed time when she gets time to have some snacks.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO EVENING SNACKS2 – LIGHT EVENING SNACKS3 – NORMAL EVENING SNACKS4 – HEAVY EVENING SNACKS11. Sugar Free Sweets TakenAs I mentioned, Deepshree takes Sugar Free Sweets and Sugar Free Ice Creams sometimes. I track the days when she has had this.This Data Item can take only 2 values – YES if the Sugar Free Sweets were taken on the Date of Recording and NO if the Sugar Free Sweets were not taken on the Date of Recording.12. Sweets TakenDeepshree does not take any Sweets under normal circumstances. However, she takes Sweets when her Blood Sugar Count falls. So, I track the days when she needs to take Sweets.This Data Item can take only 2 values – YES if the Sweets were taken on the Date of Recording and NO if the Sweets were not taken on the Date of Recording.13. Fruits TakenDeepshree does take some Fruits.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO2 – LIGHT3 – MEDIUM4 – HEAVY14. Alcohol TakenThough very rarely, maybe once in 6 months, we celebrate with some Alcohol.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO2 – LIGHT3 – MEDIUM4 – HEAVY15. ExerciseDeepshree does some Yoga and walks on the Treadmill for 30 minutes daily. If she is in the Morning Shift, she does this in the evening. If she is in the Afternoon Shift, she does this in the mornings. However, this is not possible when she is travelling or on vacations.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO2 – LIGHT3 – NORMAL4 – HEAVY16. TravelI have noticed that Travel impacts the Blood Sugar Count. So, I keep track of the amount of Travel undertaken by Deepshree on the Date of Recording.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO2 – LIGHT3 – MEDIUM4 – HEAVY17. Afternoon SleepDeepshree takes a nap for about 2 hours in the afternoon when she is on Morning Shift or on Holidays. When she has her afternoon nap, she usually feels much better. So, I track this aspect.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO2 – LIGHT3 – MEDIUM4 – HEAVY18. Night SleepNight Sleep is usually huge factor for how Deepshree would feel the next day. So, I track this aspect.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO2 – LIGHT3 – MEDIUM4 – HEAVY19. Stress LevelI believe and so does the Doctor that it is the Stress Levels which has lead to the Diabetes in Deepshree. So, I track this aspect on a daily basis.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – LIGHT2 – MEDIUM3 – HEAVY20. Body PainOn the impacts of High Blood Sugar is Body Pain. So, I track this based on Deepshree's feedback for the day.This Data Item contains categorical data. The value are as follows:1 – NO2 – LIGHT3 – MEDIUM4 – HEAVY21. Low Sugar ConditionThis is one of the variables I would like to predict in the future. I should be able to predict this as a Binary Classification problem when I have sufficient data to train the model. At the moment, I keep track of this aspect.This Data Item can take only 2 values – YES if Deepshree experienced Low Blood Sugar condition on the Date of Recording and NO if not.Like this:Like Loading...Related",https://t.co/tiYU6YOfhb,news
Blood Sugar: Cognitive Distortions & Diabetes,"It happened to me. It could happen to you. In fact, it could happen to any insulin-dependent person living with diabetes. When the smoke cleared, I couldn't believe what I saw. I saw it all! It was overwhelming at first to take it in: the clarity, the focus, the emotional stability and even my memory. I began to see memories that I didn't even know I had forgotten.The year was 1977 when I was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, now referred to Type I. While it wasn't exciting at the time, I now find it fascinating how we managed our diabetes. At age six years old I was able to play mad scientist every day, several times a day.Part of me saw the process of checking my blood sugar as fun but, in the end, I wasn't checking it at all. Let me tell you what I mean.I dropped the tablet into the test-tube full of my urine, it bubbled and foamed its way up the test tube, all the while changing colors. Then I matched the color of the urine at the bottom of the test tube, with a chart. Different colors meant various levels of sugar in our urine. Voila! It was believed at the time that sugar in urine equaled glucose in the blood. We now know that, the amount of sugar in our urine is very different from the quantity of glucose in our blood stream.Needless to say, due to improper blood sugar testing and many other reasons, my blood sugars were never under control. To me, the world was spinning out of control. My days were full of urinating all the time, feeling nauseous, daydreaming out the window cause I couldn't follow class and most days I couldn't even tell you what I did that day. I was living in a cognitive nightmare every day.I had problems with thinking, memory, motivation, learning, emotional stability, frustration, anger, sadness, depression, isolation, and remembering even the littlest things. My mind was in a fog. And it wasn't until I looked back, during a psychotherapy session many years later that I realized how different my world is now that I manage my blood sugars.Now to be fair, there was no way to manage my blood sugars when I was a child. Luckily for us, we now have the tools and the information to manage our blood sugars.It's hard to see the fog when you're in it, because you become used to it. At that time I didn't realize any of the above issues were going or how they related to high blood sugar. That's the problem! We can't always see how our blood sugars are affecting our ability to function in the here &amp; now, especially, if your blood sugar is constantly high.Psychotherapy can be a very helpful part of diabetes management. Getting non-bias observations about what is happening in our lives and our role can be priceless.I hear my clients and other people living with diabetes, say, ""I take care of my obligations, and I am not dysfunctional."" Most of the time that is true, but it's not about one's dysfunctionality. It's about stabilizing emotions and improving how well you function so you can get the most out of life.People who live in constant states of high blood sugar levels go to work, they have families, they raise children, and they go on vacations. Because, they get used to being at a high blood sugar they may not realize. Are they as connected to their children or family as they could be?Did they get the full enjoyment out of their vacation? Unfortunately, they most likely did not! Do they realize it? Probably not! I didn't at the time.It wasn't till many years later and lots of work to get my blood sugars under control that I realized one important fact. When my blood sugars were out of control, I wasn't living up to my full potential. In part, that realization motivates me to help my clients get the most out of their life. Helping them improve management; bring clarity to past and present events while helping them develop a healthier and happier life.We miss so much when our blood sugar is always high, and because we're living in it around the clock, it is tough to see we have a problem. When I was growing up, I refused to believe I had a problem. So, if you or others close to you think you may have a problem, it doesn't hurt to get a second opinion.Diabetes-focused Psychotherapy was created to help people find clarity while improving blood sugar levels. I don't do this to judge (you most likely have people who will do that for free), I developed Diabetes-Focused Psychotherapy to help others living with diabetes get the most out of their life and the ability to talk through their issues with negative feelings, frustrations, and management issues.Like this:Like Loading...Related",https://t.co/P1eHEWkJCT,news
Diabetes Diet: Regulate Blood Sugar Levels With Onions,"Diabetes is a condition that impairs the ability of the body to process blood sugar normally, thereby leading to an excess amount of glucose in the blood. Glucose is your brain's main source of fuel as well as an important source of energy for the cells that make up your tissues and muscles.Without careful management, diabetes can cause sugars to build-up in the blood thus increasing a person's risk for dangerous complications such as heart attack and stroke.There are three major types of diabetes:Type I diabetes - occurs when the body fails to produce insulin.Type 2 diabetes - affects the way the body uses insulin and has a strong link with obesity.Gestational diabetes - occurs in women during pregnancy when the body becomes less sensitive to insulin. Luckily, it resolves after giving birth.Symptoms of diabetes include:Extreme hungerIncreased thirstFrequent urinationIrritabilitySlow-healing soresBlurred visionUnexplained weight lossFatigueFrequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infectionsPresence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin)Diabetics should be very careful about choosing the foods they should eat. Fiber-rich foods must be included on the list as it enables the low release of sugars in the bloodstream which leads to the prevention of abnormal spikes.Onion is one of the foods that can regulate blood sugar level and proven to be beneficial for diabetics, especially during summer. Nutritional Composition of Raw OnionsOne cup of chopped onion contains approximately:64 calories2 grams of protein15 grams of carbohydrate3 grams of fiber0 grams of cholesterol0 grams of fat7 grams of sugar10% or more of the daily value for manganese, vitamin C, and vitamin B-6.Additionally, onions also have small amounts of magnesium, iron, calcium, folate, and potassium as well as the antioxidants sulfur and quercetin.Benefits Of Onion During The SummerDuring summer weather, onions work wonders to prevent diseases.

Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?,"Can raspberries help lower blood sugar levels and maintain weight in people with type 2 diabetes?&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Raspberries are a delicious fruit that has been widely consumed for thousands of years. They are packed full of vitamins, minerals, and powerful antioxidants that may help prevent disease and promote health. Various studies have shown that the fruit holds a plethora of health benefits, ranging from improving cardiovascular health to preventing cancer. Raspberries are also found to be beneficial in preventing as well as managing type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that the fruit may also aid weight loss.Type 2 diabetes is a chronic health condition that causes the level of blood sugar (glucose) to rise. Over time, high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, can affect your health from head to toe, resulting in a number of complications, including heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, eye damage, etc. By keeping your blood sugar under control, you can avoid all these health problems. Eating a diet high in fibre can help keep blood sugar level stable. Raspberries boast of many nutrients, including fibre, despite being low in calories, making them a great food for diabetics.How can raspberries help prevent or treat type 2 diabetes?Previous studies have shown that consuming a high-fibre diet can help improve blood glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in type 2 diabetes. Two new studies, published in Obesity and Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, suggested that eating raspberries can significantly help prevent and manage diabetes.The first study, which investigated people with 'pre-diabetes' and insulin resistance, found that eating raspberries for breakfast can help reduce glucose levels two hours later. Likewise, the second study reported that eating berries were associated with lower blood sugar levels. The results from these trials suggested that raspberry consumption could be an important dietary component for people at risk of type-2 diabetes.Also, one study found that red raspberries have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolism-stabilising properties, all of which can help reduce the risk of several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study conducted at the Centre for Nutrition Research, Institute for Food Safety and Health, Illinois Institute of Technology, also found that red raspberries contain components that can also reduce heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, the two common complications of diabetes. The research was published in Advances in Nutrition.Other health benefits of raspberriesStudies have shown that fibre and water content in raspberries may help prevent and treat constipation, aiding in maintaining a healthy digestive tract. It's worth noting that increasing fibre intake has also been linked to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as boost weight loss.The bottom line is that eating low-calorie, high-nutrient foods like raspberries as part of a healthy diet may help manage diabetes, support weight loss, and boost health. Just ensure that the fruit you bought is organic to reduce your risk of exposure to pesticides.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

"5 Foods That Boost Your Memory, In Case You've Been Feeling A Bit Forgetful Lately","Food is medicine, my friends. And aside from being delicious and downright satisfying, so many different foods often have these secret, almost seemingly magical benefits to them. For instance, there are foods that can actually boost your memory, and according to a new study, those foods tend to share one common detail, making it that much easier for you to pick up the right snacks on your next grocery run. So, if you feel like you've been a bit absentminded lately — like, a whole lot of ""Where are my keys?"" and ""What's that guy's name again?"" moments — rest assured, you might just be able to eat your way to never forgetting your brother's birthday again.Now, I'm not going to lie: The study that illustrated these findings, which has been published in the scientific journal Neurobiology of Aging, is a wee bit hard to understand. But, according to a press release from Iowa State University, the gist of what the researchers found is that there's a specific satiety hormone that's linked to a reduced likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease. Basically, the more you activate and release this hormone through the foods you're chompin' on, the more your noggin — and your memory — seems to benefit.GiphyAuriel Willette, a researcher on the study and assistant professor of food science and human nutrition at Iowa State University, said in the study's press release, The regulation of when and how much we eat can have some association with how good our memory is. Bottom line: what we eat and what our body does with it affects our brain.As for how to incorporate some memory-boosting foods into your diet on the reg? Isabel Butler, a nutritionist at Spoon Guru, says that, for one thing, when you're considering day-to-day brain function, it's a good idea to be mindful of meals that rapidly raise your blood sugar (think simple carbs found in processed foods), as she explains they can affect your short-term memory in as little as an hour. ""The best solution is eating foods that are slower to digest and raise blood sugars in a more controlled manner,"" Butler tells Elite Daily.If you're looking for specifics, here are some foods that experts say can help boost your memory.Chia Seeds GiphyA little chia pudding, anyone? Butler tells me that zinc and magnesium deficiencies have been linked to some neurological conditions, and that a lack of iron can cause that dreaded brain fog you might get sometimes.According to the nutritionist, lots of different types of seeds are packed with these nutrients, but chia seeds, specifically, she says, are a great option, not to mention a really easy addition to your granola or yogurt.BerriesGiphy""Alzheimer's is often referred to as the 'diabetes of the brain' because of its strong connection to metabolic disorders and insulin production,"" Samantha Morrison, a health and wellness expert for Glacier Wellness, tells Elite Daily. A balanced and healthy diet, she explains, can prevent these health issues including inflammation of the brain. ""Berries are a rich source of polyphenols, which slow down the aging process and combat cell damage,"" she says.Meat (Or Really Anything With Lean Protein)GiphyOther forms of lean protein work, too, like nuts or beans, but the main idea here is that protein is key for your memory and proper brain function, according to Scarlett Full, a registered dietitian and food scientist at Growing Naturals.""Some of the amino acids in protein are the building blocks for key brain neurotransmitters,"" she tells Elite Daily, ""which, without [those things], our central nervous system would not function.""",https://t.co/7qfEcU0FhM,news
Diabetes Management: 5 Desi Diabetes-Friendly Foods That May Help Prevent Blood Sugar Spikes Today News update,"HighlightsDiabetes is a common metabolic disorderDiabetics should be very cautious of their dietFibre-rich foods help stabilise blood sugar levelsDiabetes is becoming one of the biggest health scares around the world. The metabolic disorder which used to affect only a select few a while back has now afflicted countless youth and middle-aged men and women too. Diabetes is defined as a condition in which the body's blood sugar levels are abnormally high. The spike in blood sugar occurs either because the body is not producing enough insulin or it is not able to respond well to the insulin produced. It is estimated that by the year 2030, 98 million Indians would be diabetic. Diabetics need to be extra careful of their diet. They should include food that is high on fibre content. Fibre enables slow release of sugar in the bloodstream that prevents abnormal spikes. Diabetics should also steer clear of refined carbohydrates and processed junk; they metabolise fast and cause blood sugar fluctuations.Here are some desi ingredients you are likely to find in any regular Indian kitchen. Eating them may do wonders for your diabetes management.1. KuttuKuttu or buckwheat is a healthy gluten-free pseudo grain, which is used extensively in vrat preparations. According to the book 'Healing Foods' by DK Publishing House, ""the grain contains slow-release carbohydrates that help maintain steady blood sugar levels. It is abundant in magnesium and manganese, both of which are necessary for carbohydrate metabolism. Kuttu also has a low glycemic index (between 49-51), which makes it an excellent diabetic-friendly food.(Also Read: 11 Best Buckwheat Recipes | Best Kuttu Recipes)Diabetes Management: Kuttu or buckwheat is a healthy gluten-free pseudo grain2.

"Type 2 diabetes: Three foods to help lower blood sugar - eggs, garlic and cinnamon","Type 2 diabetes can trigger symptoms such as needing to pee more often, feeling thirsty all the time and feeling very tired. If the condition is left untreated, complications with the eyes, feet, kidneys and nerves can occur. When it comes to preventing type 2 diabetes and preventing the condition, a healthy diet is recommended. While there's nothing you can't eat, experts advise limiting certain foods.To manage blood sugar you should eat a wide range of foods, including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta, and you should keep sugar, fat and salt to a minimum.Specific foods have also been found to have blood sugar-lowering properties - three of these being eggs, garlic and cinnamon.In one study, people with type 2 diabetes who consumed two eggs daily as part of a high-protein diet showed improvements in blood sugar levels.The NHS states eggs are a good choice as part of a healthy, balanced diet, which is recommended for type 2 diabetes.As well as being a source of protein, eggs also contain vitamins and minerals.The health body adds: ""There is no recommended limit on how many eggs people should eat.""Eggs can be enjoyed as part of a healthy, balanced diet, but it's best to cook them without adding salt or fat.""For example, boiled or poached, without added salt, scrambled without butter and using low-fat milk instead of cream.""Frying eggs can increase their fat content by around 50 per cent.""Garlic is a popular herb used in dishes all over the world and has been linked to a number of impressive health benefits.Several studies have demonstrated how garlic can reduce inflammation, blood sugar and LDL cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes.'Effects of garlic on dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus' is just one study that demonstrates this.High blood pressure often occurs with type 2 diabetes, and garlic as also proven effective at reducing blood pressure.In one study, participants with uncontrolled high blood pressure who ate garlic for 12 weeks averaged a 10-point decrease in blood pressure.Several controlled studies have shown the spice cinnamon can lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity.One study demonstrated type 2 diabetes patients who took cinnamon for 90 days had more than a double reduction in haemoglobin A1C (a form of haemoglobin that is covalently bound to glucose) than those who only received standard care.The study was titled 'Effectiveness of cinnamon for lowering hemoglobin A1C in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, controlled trial'.In three trials involving cinnamon cassia, fasting glucose levels fell by between 10.3 per cent and 29 per cent with no significant changes in those on placebo.Cinnamon can be found ground, in tea or supplement form.",https://t.co/dGRZj6sRDk,news
The Blood Sugar Diet: what 800 calories really looks like,"It's the stricter version of the 5:2 diet that can help lower blood sugar levels and could reverse type 2 diabetes. Involving eating 800 calories a day for 8 weeks, here's what three days of 800 calorie diet meal plans looks likeHigh blood sugar levels - millions of us have it, but many of us don't know it and it's led to not just a type 2 diabetes epidemic, but also a rise in prediabetes, the condition that precedes it. Could calorie restriction help? It worked for medical journalist, Dr Michael Mosley and in his book, The 8-Week Blood Sugar Diet, he shares the science behind it.Inspired by Dr Mosley's own experiences as a type 2 diabetic (which he no longer is), the book's aimed at helping those with diabetes, and those at high risk of developing it, lose belly fat and reduce and stabilise their blood sugar levels through modifications to their diet.A stricter version of the 5:2 diet, the first stage involves an intensive fasting period - an 800 calorie a day plan for eight weeks (something he's gone on to write more about in his latest book, The Fast 800 which Dr Mosley has now turned into an online lifestyle programme). Unlike a 'soups-and-shakes' type of diet that the NHS recently announced it will be prescribing to thousands of people in the UK who have the condition, it involves eating food based on the fundamentals of the Mediterranean diet.And while he emphasises that individual medical guidance is key, and that no one diet will necessarily work for everyone (see his contraindications here) the evidence that radical calorie restriction works is strong. What does a menu of 800 calories a day look like? It's more than you think. Here's an insight into the weekday meal plans, including a weekend option which features a brunch recipe combined with a more substantial supper.Day 1For breakfastYoghurt with passion fruit and almonds - 170 caloriesServes 1150g plain yoghurt1 tbsp flaked almonds1 passion fruitToast the flaked almonds in a dry frying pan over a low heat for a few minutes, until they turn golden.

Effect of Bananas on Diabetes and Blood Sugar Levels,"For this reason, avoiding or minimizing foods that cause big blood sugar spikes is essential. Despite being a healthy fruit, bananas are pretty high in both carbs and sugar, the main nutrients that raise blood sugar levels.So, should you be eating bananas if you have diabetes? How do they affect your blood sugar?Bananas Contain Carbs, Which Raise Blood SugarBananas are high in carbs, which cause blood sugar levels to rise more than other nutrients.If you have diabetes, being aware of the amount and type of carbs in your diet is important.This is because carbs raise your blood sugar level more than other nutrients, which means they can greatly affect your blood sugar control.When blood sugar rises in non-diabetic people, the body produces insulin. It helps the body move sugar out of the blood and into the cells where it's used or stored.However, this process doesn't work as it should in diabetics. Instead, either the body doesn't produce enough insulin or the cells are resistant to the insulin that is made.If not managed properly, this can result in high-carb foods causing big blood sugar spikes or constantly high blood sugar levels, both of which are bad for your health.93% of the calories in bananas come from carbs. These carbs are in the form of sugar, starch and fiber.A single medium-sized banana contains 14 grams of sugar and 6 grams of starch.Bananas Also Contain Fiber, Which May Reduce Blood Sugar SpikesIn addition to starch and sugar, a medium-sized banana contains 3 grams of fiber.Everyone, including diabetics, should eat adequate amounts of dietary fiber due to its potential health benefits.However, fiber is especially important for people with diabetes, as it can help slow the digestion and absorption of carbs.This can reduce blood sugar spikes and improve overall blood sugar control.One way of determining how a carb-containing food will affect blood sugars is by looking at its glycemic index (GI).The glycemic index ranks foods based on how much and how quickly they raise blood sugar levels.The scores run from 0 to 100 with the following classifications:Low GI: 55 or less.Medium GI: 56–69.High GI: 70–100.Diets based on low-GI foods are thought to be particularly good for people with type 2 diabetes.This is because low-GI foods are absorbed more slowly and cause a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels, rather than large spikes.Overall, bananas score between low and medium on the GI scale (between 42–62, depending on the ripeness).In addition to sugar and starch, bananas contain some fiber. This means that the sugars in bananas are more slowly digested and absorbed, which could prevent blood sugar spikes.Green (Unripe) Bananas Contain Resistant StarchThe type of carbs in your banana depends on the ripeness.Green or unripe bananas contain less sugar and more resistant starch.Green (unripe) bananas contain resistant starch, which doesn't raise blood sugar and may even improve long-term blood sugar control.Resistant starches are long chains of glucose (starch) that are ""resistant"" to digestion in the upper part of your digestive system.This means that they function in a similar way as fiber, and won't cause a rise in blood sugar levels.However, they may help feed the friendly bacteria in your gut, which has been linked to improved metabolic health and better blood sugar control.In fact, a recent study on blood sugar control in women with type 2 diabetes found some interesting results. Those supplementing with resistant starch had better blood sugar control than those who didn't over an 8-week period.Other studies have found resistant starch to have beneficial effects in people with type 2 diabetes. These include improving insulin sensitivity and reducing inflammation.The role of resistant starch in type 1 diabetes is less clear.A Banana's Effect on Blood Sugar Depends on its RipenessYellow or ripe bananas contain less resistant starch than green bananas and more sugar, which is more quickly absorbed than starch.Yellow, ripe bananas contain more sugar than green, unripe ones. This means they cause a bigger rise in your blood sugar level.This means that fully ripe bananas have a higher GI and will cause your blood sugar to rise faster than green or unripe bananas.Portion Size Is ImportantRipeness isn't the only factor when it comes to the amount of sugar in your banana.The size of the banana you eat determines its effect on your blood sugar level. The larger the banana, the more carbs you'll consume and the greater the rise in your blood sugar will be.This means that a larger banana will have a greater effect on your blood sugar level.This portion-size effect is called the glycemic load.Glycemic load is calculated by multiplying the glycemic index of a food by the amount of carbs in a serving, then dividing that number by 100.A score of less than 10 is considered low, 11–19 is medium and more than 20 is high.Here's the approximate amount of carbs in the different sizes of bananas (3):Extra small banana (6 inches or less): 18.5 grams.Small banana (about 6–6.9 inches long): 23 grams.Medium banana (7–7.9 inches long): 27 grams.Large banana (8–8.9 inches long): 31 grams.Extra large banana (9 inches or longer): 35 grams.If all these bananas were fully ripe (GI of 62), then their glycemic load would range from 11 for an extra small banana to 22 for an extra large banana.To ensure you don't cause your blood sugar to rise too much, it's important to be aware of the size of the banana you're eating.Are Bananas Safe for Diabetics?Most generic dietary guidelines for diabetes recommend following a healthy, balanced diet which includes fruit.Fruits like bananas are a healthy food that contains fiber, vitamins and minerals. You can include bananas in your diet, even if you have diabetes.This is because eating fruits and vegetables has been linked with better health and a lower risk of disease, such as heart disease and some cancers.Diabetics are at an even greater risk of these diseases, so eating enough fruits and vegetables is important.Unlike refined sugar products like candies and cake, the carbs in fruit such as bananas come with fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.More specifically, bananas provide you with fiber, potassium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. They also contain some antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds.A recent study looked at the effect of limiting fruits on the blood sugar control of 63 people with type 2 diabetes.They found that advising people to eat no more than 2 pieces of fruit per day resulted in people eating less fruit.However, they also found that eating less fruit did not improve blood sugar control, weight lossor waist circumference.For most people with diabetes, fruits (including bananas) are a healthy choice.One exception to this is if you're following a low-carb diet to control your diabetes. Even a small banana contains around 22 grams of carbs, which may be too much for your diet plan.If you are able to eat bananas, it's important to be mindful of the ripeness and size of the banana to reduce its effect on your blood sugar level.How to Eat Bananas When You Have DiabetesIf you have diabetes, it's perfectly possible to enjoy fruit such as bananas as part of a healthy diet.If you like bananas, the following tips could help minimize their effects on your blood sugar levels:Watch your portion size: Eat a smaller banana to reduce the amount of sugar you eat in one sitting.Choose a firm, nearly-ripe banana: Pick a banana that's not overly ripe so that the sugar content is slightly lower.Spread your fruit intake throughout the day: Spread out your fruit intake to help reduce the glycemic load and keep your blood sugar stable.Eat them with other foods: Enjoy your bananas with other foods, such as nuts or full-fat yogurt, to help slow down the digestion and absorption of the sugar.If you're diabetic, remember that all carb-containing foods can affect people's blood sugars differently.Therefore, you might want to monitor how eating bananas affects your blood sugar and adjust your eating habits accordingly.",https://t.co/CRQV4fIElU,news
Consortium aims to study link between childhood blood sugar levels and mid-life brain health,"A consortium of Louisiana scientists from LSU's Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Tulane University and Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center aims to discover how blood sugar levels early in life contribute to a person's brain health in middle age.These results could lead to new blood sugar management guidelines for children and help prevent late-life cognitive decline - a condition for which there is no effective treatment.""The Bogalusa Heart Study is one of the longest, ongoing studies of a biracial, semi-rural community in the South. It is the only study that collected assessments of the community members' metabolic status from early childhood through mid-life,"" says Dr. Owen Carmichael, co-principal investigator and director of Pennington Biomedical's Biomedical Imaging Center.

Type 2 diabetes: Eat garlic with your meals to lower blood sugar levels,"Type 2 diabetes causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) levels to become too high. If the condition is left untreated or uncontrolled it can lead to complications such as eye problems, kidney problems, heart attack and stroke. There are a number of risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes, including lack of exercise, smoking and a poor diet, high in fat and sugar. A healthy diet is one way you can help manage your blood sugar levels, and certain foods in particular, like garlic, have been proven to have blood sugar-lowering properties.Garlic is a popular herb used in dishes all over the world and has been linked to a number of impressive health benefits.Several studies have demonstrated how garlic can reduce inflammation, blood sugar and LDL cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes.'Effects of garlic on dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus' is just one study that demonstrates this.High blood pressure often occurs with type 2 diabetes, and garlic as also proven effective at reducing blood pressure.In one study, participants with uncontrolled high blood pressure who ate garlic for 12 weeks averaged a 10-point decrease in blood pressure.Being more active has also been proven to lower blood sugar levels.For diabetes, greater health benefits are gained from doing a combination of aerobic or high intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance exercise, according to Diabetes UK.Aerobic exercise includes activities such as walking, cycling, jogging and swimming performed at a steady intensity.With HIIT training, low-to-moderate intensity intervals are alternated with high-intensity intervals and can be applied to various types of aerobic exercises such as running or cycling.Resistance exercise consists of lifting free weights, using weight machines, performing exercises using resistance bands and the body's own weight.The diabetes research charity explains: ""Daily exercise, or ensuring that two days do not elapse between exercise sessions, ensures that you remain insulin sensitive.""The insulin sensitivity benefits of exercise wear off after about 24 hours (this is based on a person with type 2 diabetes engaging in low-intensity exercise for approximately an hour per day).""Exercise which improves muscle mass - such as resistance exercise - is important for maintaining or building muscle as it helps the body to be more insulin sensitive.""And, as we lose muscle mass as we age, incorporating some form of resistance exercise at least twice per week on non-consecutive days becomes extremely important.""Symptoms of type 2 diabetes to watch out for, according to the NHS, are:Peeing more than usual, particularly at nightFeeling thirsty all the timeFeeling very tiredLosing weight without trying toItching around your penis or vagina, or repeatedly getting thrushCuts or wounds taking longer to healBlurred vision",https://t.co/XPkAxUOWcW,news
Why cheese may help control your blood sugar,"Mmmm, cheese – a food as nutritious as it is delicious. Or is it? On the one hand, cheese is an excellent source of minerals like calcium and magnesium, vitamins A, B2 and B12, not to mention being a complete protein. On the other hand, cheese is also a significant source of saturated fat and sodium in our diets. To lower saturated fat intake, consuming reduced-fat cheese is sometimes recommended to lower cardiovascular disease risk. Paradoxically, however, there is now a growing body of evidence that people who eat lots of cheese do not have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, including Type 2 diabetes. Our research team at the University of Alberta examined the impact of both reduced- and regular-fat cheese on insulin resistance in the bodies of pre-diabetic rats. We found that both types of cheese reduced insulin resistance, which is important to maintain normal blood sugars.Why we used ratsMany of the studies previously conducted into the impact of cheese on cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been observational. In other words, researchers have studied the usual eating behaviour of large numbers of people, usually for years, and then correlated the amount of cheese (and other dairy foods) eaten with the development of CVD risks, such as high cholesterol or coronary artery disease. Observational studies of human eating patterns cannot be used to determine causation. (Shutterstock) A 2016 survey of published observational studies found that cheese had either a neutral or beneficial effect on several CVD risk factorsThese studies are very useful to establish trends associated with usual eating patterns but they can't definitively say that a particular food causes or prevents a particular disease. To understand causation better, studies that examine the effects of foods in a controlled setting are useful. These studies can be conducted in humans but there are limitations. Thus, studies in laboratory animals can also be useful, particularly in understanding biochemical mechanisms.Cheese and insulin resistanceInsulin resistance is a condition that commonly develops with ageing and obesity, leading to high blood glucose, and risk factor of CVD and Type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to compare how consuming reduced- versus regular-fat cheese affected insulin resistance, and to explore biochemical mechanisms that might explain any observed effects.We used a rat model of insulin resistance that shares many characteristics with humans. We created the model by feeding the rats high amounts of lard. After four weeks, the rats were divided into three groups: 1) lard diet, 2) lard diet and reduced-fat cheddar cheese, 3) lard diet and regular fat cheddar cheese. All the diets had the same total amount of fat, only the source of it varied (lard versus cheese). The rats ate these diets for eight more weeks.The most interesting finding in our research was that both reduced- and regular-fat cheddar cheese reduced insulin resistance in the rats. This suggests that the beneficial effects of cheese might not be related to the amount of fat but to some other component, such as the protein or the calcium.Butter versus cheeseA few new studies in humans have appeared in the literature since we began our study. A group from Laval University and the University of Manitoba compared the effects of eating fats from different sources in men and women with abdominal obesity. Another study tested butter, cheese, olive oil and corn oil diets and found no impact on insulin levels. (Shutterstock) The diet duration was four weeks and each diet was assessed in all the participants. Butter, cheese, olive oil and corn oil diets (32 per cent calories from fat) were compared with a higher carbohydrate diet (25 per cent calories from fat). The researchers examined blood glucose and insulin levels (which are indirect indicators of insulin resistance) and found no effect from any of the fats. However, the blood samples were collected after fasting, so the information about blood sugar was incomplete.Another study that compared reduced- to regular-fat cheese found no overall differences on LDL-cholesterol characteristics in people with cardiovascular disease risk factors, but did not examine blood sugar-related outcomes.Changing blood metabolitesIn our study, we also examined how metabolites in the blood changed after cheese feeding and found similar effects in reduced- and regular-fat cheese. The changes are related to a specific type of molecule called phospholipids, which have many functions in the body. Interestingly, low-circulating phospholipids are linked with diabetes and insulin resistance in humans. The rats fed on a lard diet had lower phospholipid levels. These were normalized in the rats that ate cheese. We are pursuing this line of research now — to understand how cheese regulates phospholipid metabolism and how this relates to insulin resistance.",https://t.co/G91yooQQTh,news
Ipragliflozin versus metformin for blood sugar control and fat reduction in type 2 diabetes,"Ipragliflozin versus metformin for blood sugar control and fat reduction in type 2 diabetes Posted by Medivizor on May 17, 2019 in Diabetes mellitus | In a nutshell The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ipragliflozin compared to metformin in improving blood sugar control and reducing fat on organs in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with sitagliptin. The main finding of the study was that ipragliflozin had greater reductions in fat but metformin had better blood sugar control.Some background There are many different medications used to treat T2D. Different drugs are used in a different order all over the world. For example, in the United States and Europe, metformin (Glucophage) is used first. If blood sugar is not controlled with metformin, other drugs are added such as DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2-inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) include sitagliptin (Januvia), Vildagliptin (Galvus), Saxagliptin (Onglyza), Linagliptin (Tradjenta. SGLT2 inhibitors include drugs such as ipragliflozin (Suglat). In Asia, DPP-4is are used first and metformin is added after. The best combination of these drugs remains unclear.When fat accumulates in the body, it gets deposited on some organs such as the liver and pancreas (the organ that controls blood sugar). This is called visceral fat (VF). VF causes these organs to not work properly and therefore blood sugar is not controlled.It is not known which of the diabetic medications is better at reducing VF and improving blood sugar.Methods &amp; findings This study included 98 patients with T2D and were taking a DPP-4is (sitagliptin). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ipragliflozin 50mg daily or metformin 500mg daily (increased to 1000 daily after 2-4 weeks). Patients were treated for 24 weeks.After 24 weeks, the ipragliflozin group had significantly greater reductions in VF than the metformin group. They also had significantly greater reductions in body weight and waist measurements. However, the metformin group had significantly greater reductions in their HbA1c (blood test measuring average blood sugar control over the past 3 months) than the ipragliflozin group. The metformin group also had significantly greater decreases in their LDL cholesterol (""bad cholesterol"". The ipragliflozin had an increase in both LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol (""good cholesterol). The ipragliflozin group also had greater reductions in the amount of fats in the blood.The bottom line The authors concluded that ipragliflozin was better in reducing organ fat whereas metformin was better at improving blood sugar control and cholesterol in patients with T2D treated with sitagliptin.The fine print This study had a very small number of patients and only included Japanese patients. Different ethnicities have different responses to medications. Larger studies are needed for more solid evidence.Published By :Diabetes, Obesity and MetabolismOriginal Title :Comparing the effects of ipragliflozin versus metformin on visceral fat reduction and metabolic dysfunction in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sitagliptin: A prospective, multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomised controlled For personalized updates regarding diabetes mellitus: signup For personalized updates regarding diabetes mellitus: signup Oops.

Reversing Diabetes,"Do you have type 2 diabetes? Have you been told you have to give up juicy watermelon or sweet grapes? What if we told you those foods really aren't taboo? Learn how participants at the Pritikin Longevity Center have success with their blood sugars… even while enjoying fruit!For people who need to watch their blood sugar, a high-carbohydrate diet is actually good for you. What's critical is the type of carbohydrate. Certainly, if you're eating refined carbs like white bread and sugary desserts, blood sugar levels can shoot up.The Right CarbohydratesBut if the bulk of your diet is fiber-rich, unprocessed carbohydrates like vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains, and beans, you may be able to normalize blood sugar levels and even reverse the diagnosis of pre-diabetes and diabetes, scientists are now discovering.An investigation conducted by UCLA researchers followed diabetic men at the Pritikin Longevity Center for three weeks. It reported that the Pritikin Eating Plan, high in whole, fiber-filled carbohydrates, plus daily exercise, not only helped the men lose weight and improve cholesterol levels, it also decreased blood sugar levels by 20% and insulin levels by 30%.1Reversing DiabetesWhat's more, by the end of their three-week program, the majority of the men had controlled their fasting blood glucose, or blood sugar, so well that ""they were no longer classified as diabetic,"" wrote lead investigators Drs. James Barnard and Christian Roberts of UCLA. Some of the men left Pritikin completely free of their diabetic medications, and others had their medication dosages reduced.In addition to normalizing blood sugar and reducing classic heart disease risk factors like high cholesterol and high blood pressure, the Pritikin Program of diet and exercise also substantially improved recently discovered risk factors, such as inflammation in the arteries.Nitric Oxide, Healing ArteriesPrevention of heart disease, the #1 killer in America, is especially important for people with diabetes since heart attacks occur two to four times more frequently if you have this disease. Diabetes damages the endothelial (inner) lining of the arteries, choking off blood flow to the heart. The Pritikin Program, the UCLA scientists found, increases the production of endothelial-healing substances like nitric oxide.Diabetes RetreatAll-Inclusive health resort. Physician supervised Diabetes RetreatIn related research,2 scientists funded by the National Institutes of Health followed 99 type 2 diabetics for four months. Half followed a vegetarian diet similar to the Pritikin Eating Plan (low in fat and very high in straight-from-the-earth unrefined carbohydrates like vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains).The other half followed the standard dietary advice from the American Diabetes Association, which was higher in fat and refined carbs than the Pritikin-style diet.Losing Twice As Much WeightThe diabetics in the Pritikin-style group lowered their blood sugar more and shed twice as much weight (14 pounds) compared to the ADA group (7 pounds). They also lowered their LDL ""bad"" cholesterol more and ended up with better kidney function than the ADA dieters.The scientists, led by Dr. David Jenkins of the University of Toronto and Dr. Neal Barnard of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, also reported that the very-low-fat, high-carb, high-fiber diet had no potentially harmful changes, such as higher triglycerides or lower HDL ""good"" cholesterol levels. The results of this diet, in short, were all good.Other investigations have found that lifestyle-change programs like Pritikin do a superb job of alleviating the Metabolic Syndrome, a cluster of factors, including belly fat, that is now epidemic in the U.S. and puts one at major risk for diabetes and heart disease.In published research on adults staying at the Pritikin Longevity Center for three weeks, the Metabolic Syndrome was not only controlled, it was reversed.3The same held true for kids. Among children with the Metabolic Syndrome who came to Pritikin, fully 100% no longer had the clinical diagnosis of the syndrome within two weeks.4Healthy Vs. Unhealthy CarbsScientists at Harvard University recently studied the risk of diabetes in a large population – 160,000 women and 40,000 men – who were tracked for nearly three decades.(5) Those who ate more healthy carbs like fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains and fewer unhealthy carbs, such as sugary drinks, fruit juices, and refined grains, had a 34% lower risk of diabetes, regardless of their weight.By contrast, those men and women who ate more unhealthy carbs had a 16% higher risk of diabetes.Reversing Diabetes | Permanently?Can you actually reverse diabetes for good?Insulin resistance, which is the root cause of type 2 diabetes, can be reversed.Insulin resistance means that the pancreas is producing insulin, but the body's cells are resisting it. Their ""doors"" are ""shut"" to insulin and the glucose that insulin is trying to ferry into the cells. The cells are rejecting the glucose because they're already stuffed with it. So glucose builds up in the blood.How Long Does It Take To Reverse Diabetes?By his third day at the Pritikin Diabetes Retreat, Jeff Garlin, star of Curb Your Enthusiasm, had returned his blood sugar to normal, nondiabetic levels. How Long Will It Take You To Reverse Diabetes?The pancreas, determined to deposit that glucose into the cells, pumps out more and more insulin to ""break"" those cell doors down. That's why people with pre-diabetes or diabetes often have high insulin levels.Many people recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes can reverse insulin resistance by following a healthy diet and exercise program like Pritikin and losing a significant amount of excess body weight. Not only will they reverse insulin resistance, many will also be able to eliminate or reduce their diabetes medications. With lifestyle changes alone, they're able to maintain normal or close-to-normal blood glucose (sugar) levels.Cure?Now, is this a ""cure""?""It certainly is if you continue to live a healthy, Pritikin lifestyle. If you do, chances are very good you will never suffer the direct consequences of diabetes, such as blindness, diabetic neuropathy (loss of feeling in the feet and hands), kidney failure, and even heart attacks and strokes,"" says Seth Marquit, MD, Medical Director at the Pritikin Longevity Center.But yes, if you return to SAD (the standard American diet) and a sedentary lifestyle, you can expect your blood sugar to rise. The weight will come back. Insulin resistance will return, and so will the need for diabetes medications.""But thousands who have come to the Pritikin Longevity Center do in fact feel 'cured.' For years, they've been enjoying their life and their healthy food and fitness habits. Their blood glucose is normal. Their fasting insulin levels indicate no insulin resistance. They have no need for diabetic medications. They're seeing their doctor only once or twice a year. They're traveling. They're vital. They're happy. Life is good. This all sounds like a great 'cure' to me,"" smiles Dr. Marquit.Preventing and Reversing Diabetes | Vital For Our NationIn the last 30 years, reports the Centers for Disease Control , the number of adults in the U.S. with diagnosed diabetes nearly quadrupled. If this trend continues, warns the CDC, as many as 1 out of every 3 adults in the U. S. could have diabetes by 2050.(6)It's a looming monster not only medically but economically. An analysis published in the journal Diabetes Care found that the economic burden of diagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes exceeded $322 billion in 2012, consisting of $244 billion in excess medical costs and $78 billion in reduced productivity.(7)""Combined, this amounts to an economic burden exceeding $1,000 for each American in 2012,"" the authors concluded.Healing Power of Healthy LivingWe need a solution for the crushing burden of diabetes and other cardiovascular-related diseases. The thousands who have been to the Pritikin Longevity Center over the last 40 years know what that solution is. Healthy living like the Pritikin Program heals. Healthy living like the Pritikin Program can erase our diabetes epidemic.Health ResortTake life to the next level, and be all that you can be. That's what a vacation at Pritikin is all about. Live better. Look better. Best of all, feel better.All-Inclusive ProgramSince 1975, 100,000+ people have come to Pritikin.

Type 2 diabetes: Adding onion to meals could lower blood sugar,"Type 2 diabetes is a common condition in the UK which can trigger symptoms such as needing to pee more often, feeling thirsty all the time and feeling very tired. Left untreated, it can lead to long-term complications involving the kidney, eyes and nerves. Diet plays a big part in managing your blood sugar levels, and whether you have type 2 diabetes or not, experts recommend you eat a wide range of foods, including fruit, vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta, and keep sugar, fat and salt to a minimum. Many studies have also shown specific foods to have blood sugar lowering properties, such as onions.A study involving 42 people with type 2 diabetes showed eating 3.5 ounces (100g) of fresh red onion reduced fasting blood sugar levels after just four hours. Additionally, a number of animal studies have shown eating onions to benefit blood sugar control.A study demonstrated that diabetic rats fed food containing 5 per cent onion extract for 28 days had decreased fasting blood sugar. Onions anti diabetic effects come from compounds such as quercetin and sulphur.Quercetin has been shown to interact with cells in the small intestine, pancreas, skeletal muscle, fat tissue and liver to control blood sugar regulation. Another food which has been found to have a blood sugar lowering effect is oats. A 2015 review which looked at 16 studies found oats have a beneficial effect on glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes.Experts says oats have this effect because of their low GI score, making them less likely to cause spikes and dips in blood sugar levels.Oats, including oatmeal and oat bran, also contain B-glucans, which can reduce glucose and insulin responses after meals.But doctors recommend people with diabetes don't eat too many oats because one cup contains roughly 28g of carbohydrates.Carbohydrates are known to raise blood sugar levels.Changes to diet isn't the only way to lower blood sugar.Alongside a healthy diet, keeping active can help manage blood sugar levels.But what types of exercise are most effective?Regular exercise is stated by the government as 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity a week.Diabetes.co.uk explained: ""Aerobic activity at moderate intensity basically means exercising at a level that raises your heart rate and makes you sweat. This includes a multitude of sports.""Here are six examples of aerobic exercise that can people with type 2 diabetes.",https://t.co/8NlZ4QpbMd,news
Victoza® demonstrated superiority in reducing blood sugar vs placebo in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes,"BALTIMORE, April 28, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Novo Nordisk today announced the results from the ELLIPSE trial which examined efficacy and safety and demonstrated superiority of Victoza® (liraglutide) injection 1.8 mg vs placebo in reducing blood sugar in children and adolescents aged 10-17 with type 2 diabetes.1 ELLIPSE is the first phase 3 trial completed in over a decade in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. These data were presented today at the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES)/Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) Annual Meeting in Baltimore, MD and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.2 Victoza® is currently indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. This study was designed to evaluate the investigational use of Victoza® in children and adolescents.The ELLIPSE trial included a 26-week, double-blinded treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period. The trial results showed that, when added to metformin, with or without concurrent basal insulin treatment, Victoza® significantly reduced A1C at both 26 weeks (primary endpoint) and 52 weeks (secondary endpoint), -0.64% and -0.50% respectively, versus placebo, where there was an increase in A1C at both 26 weeks and 52 weeks, +0.42% and +0.80% respectively (p&lt;0.001 for both).2 Additionally, the proportion of children and adolescents achieving A1C &lt;7% at week 26 (secondary endpoint) was significantly higher in those treated with Victoza® (63.7%) than in those treated with placebo (36.5%), p&lt;0.001.2""The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents is increasing, driven by the global epidemic of childhood obesity, yet our treatment options are limited,"" said Dr. William Tamborlane, professor and Chief of Endocrinology, Yale School of Medicine and ELLIPSE lead investigator. ""These data represent a potential new treatment option for lowering blood sugar in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes."" The results of the ELLIPSE trial have been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for evaluation as a potential treatment option for children 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes. ""We are delighted with the ELLIPSE trial results and look forward to discussions with the FDA and EMA about these data for Victoza®,"" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. ""These data add to the extensive evidence for the use of Victoza® and further cement Novo Nordisk's commitment to addressing a considerable and growing unmet medical need across the full spectrum of the type 2 diabetes patient population.""Overall, the safety profile of Victoza® seen in children and adolescents was similar to that seen in adults. In the trial, the percentage of children who reported an adverse event (AE) was similar in both groups (84.8% with Victoza® vs 80.9% with placebo). Gastrointestinal AEs occurred more frequently with Victoza® (33.3%) than placebo (13.2%).2 Adverse events greater than or equal to 5% in patients treated with Victoza® include headache, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, pyrexia and decreased appetite. Minor hypoglycemia occurred in 24.2% of patients treated with Victoza® vs 10.3% in the placebo arm. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia in patients treated with Victoza®.2About Victoza®Victoza® (liraglutide) injection 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on January 25, 2010, as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. In Europe, approved in 2009, Victoza® is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes together with diet and exercise, as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications and in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. Victoza® is commercially available in more than 100 countries, treating more than 1.2 million people with type 2 diabetes globally.3About ELLIPSEELLIPSE (NCT01541215) is a phase 3, multicenter trial in which 135 children 10-17 years of age were randomized 1:1 to treatment with Victoza® (liraglutide) up to 1.8 mg/day or placebo, in combination with metformin, with or without basal insulin, for a 26-week, double-blind period, followed by a 26-week open label extension for collection of additional data (total 52 weeks), as well as an additional 52 week off-treatment safety follow-up for people treated for more than 3 months with liraglutide.4About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a global healthcare company that's been making innovative medicines to help people with diabetes lead longer, healthier lives for 95 years.

3 Home Remedies to reduce Blood Sugar,"The health at the present times has remained just an imagination because the lifestyle of the present times has weakened the immune system so much that any disease makes it easy for them to become victims. At present, blood sugar is such a disease.Many people in the country suffer from it and the world has become disturbed due to this. It is important to control your blood sugar levels and avoid problems. Here are some home remedies that will help you control blood sugar levels.1. Amla: Medicinal properties found in amla can help you reduce the sugar. Amla is one of the most important sources of vitamin C and it helps your pancreas to produce good insulin so that your blood glucose level is balanced. To reduce the sugar, take 2-3 grams and remove their seeds and grind them thoroughly and squeeze their juice.Mix about 2 teaspoons of this juice in a cup of water and drink it in empty stomach every morning. Besides, to reduce blood sugar, mix one cup of bitter gourd juice and one teaspoon amla juice and drink it every day.2. Cinnamon: Cinnamon regulates diabetes, stimulates insulin activity, and reduces blood glucose levels in the body. There is a good and simple home remedy for reducing cinnamon sugar. Cinnamon is rich in all properties and is a marvelous spice that is full of bioactive compounds like cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde, which can improve the health of diabetics.It is famous for controlling diabetes and triggers insulin activity to reduce the level of high blood glucose in your body. You can mix one teaspoon of cinnamon with half a cup of warm water and drink it daily. You can also add cinnamon to tea, smoothies and baked desserts.3. Aloevera: Aloevera is a good remedy for reducing sugar. Aloevera is rich in phytosterols, which can have anti-hyperglycemic effects on people with type 2 diabetes. Nutritionists suggest that it is a safe and natural source for reducing the level of sugar in your blood. In addition, you can prepare a mixture of turmeric and aloevera. This herbal medicine is used to control blood glucose.Read LaterAdd to FavouritesAdd to Collection",https://t.co/6wo677o5KS,news

Allow's examine the a lot more common flours and also have a look at the potential to include the brand-new flours in your diet.Almond FlourAlmond flour is made from ground up blanched almonds. It is the ideal sampling Paleo flour, IMO. Neutral on the taste buds and also an oh-so-moist crumb! When you desire muffins, waffles, cakes or basically any kind of baked good, almond flour has your back.As a Paleo-eater, recognizing the sourcing of my food is a must. I have the tendency to go easy on almond flour since due to the fact that it takes 1.1 gallons of water making 1 almond and many United States almonds originate from California which sadly remains in an exceptional draught right now.Almonds are much lower in carbohydrates and also rather greater in protein compared to coconut flour, yet for an additional factor to view your almond flour consumption, almonds can additionally contribute to your nutritional consumption of omega-6 PUFAs.Coconut FlourAlmond flours' opponent. Coconut flour is ground up coconut meat after it has been pressed for coconut milk. It is a much a lot more absorbing flour and higher in fiber when contrasted to almond flour (10 grams versus 3 grams from 1/4 cup).Coconut flour dishes tend to require very little quantities of the flour and a high amount of wetness, commonly through eggs. It's so efficient soaking up fluid since it is incredibly high in inulin fiber. FYI – this very soluble and thick and very fermentable fiber does not have the tendency to jive well with any person that has FODMAP, SIBO or IBS issues.Coconut has a more generic, somewhat sweet flavor and can be recruited where you would certainly likewise make use of almond flour – brownies, muffins, cakes, pizza crust, etc. I prefer to use it as a coating for things like for poultry fingers, because I have the tendency to discover the appearance of coconut flour to be dry in recipes for baked goods.Cassava FlourCassava (additionally called Yuca) is an origin veggie. Cassava is a standard food for half a billion individuals across Africa, Asia, and also Latin America. If you're not knowledgeable about cassava flour, you may be with pudding flour. Tapioca flour originates from the cassava plant, made use of making tapioca pudding. Pudding is the blonde and removed starch of the cassava origin while cassava flour is the entire root that includes the fiber: peeled off, dried out, and also ground.Cassava is typically made use of in the very same proportions as wheat flour in a lot of instances, with the exception of yeast-based recipes. This flour is known for a clean, smooth, neutral flavor as well as similar in texture to wheat flour. Cassava flour can be used for baked items, or the origin can be steamed or mashed like potatoes or fried.Cassava is permitted on autoimmune paleo diet regimens, however is higher in carbs, about 78 grams each mug with around 4 grams of fiber. One caution is that it when purchasing from a food store, the roots must be steamed before it's eaten due to the fact that it could create cyanide poisoning if raw! (The wonderful selection has less hydrogen cyanide after that bitter selections.) The popular Asian food, bamboo shoots in a similar way have this building. It's important to note that a little number of people are also sensitive to the plant– the American Cancer Society alerts that those with a latex rubber allergy could be much more susceptible. Chestnut FlourWhile chestnuts are tree nuts, their make-up is starchier and less fatty when contrasted to various other nuts. Chestnuts would be akin to plantain, yam and also wonderful potatoes. Chestnut flour can be used to change almond flour, however it has a solid, nutty taste. They could be eaten either baked over an open fire (could not aid myself!), raw, baked or boiled. All you Paleo peeps could be questioning about phytic acid in chestnuts.You should know that the material for chestnuts is surprisingly low! There has to do with 47mg/100g of phytic acid in chestnuts while you'll locate 1,280 mg/100g in almonds and 760mg/100g in walnuts. For you low-carb individuals, you can discover 53 grams of carbohydrates in 100 grams of chestnuts, 5 which are from fiber. 100 grams additionally has a commendable everyday values: 59% manganese, 17% potassium, 25% copper, 43% vitamin C as well as 25% B6.Tigernut FlourFirst, let's get this off the beaten track, tigernuts are not nuts! I recognize it has it in the name, which is fairly deceiving, but it's really an origin vegetable. Alright, currently you have me back on your silver lining, intend to find out more, ideal?! Tigernut flour is understood to have a pleasing flavor, without weird aftertaste sensed from some gluten-free flours and has a 1:1 substitute ratio to wheat flour.",https://t.co/jmkavG1y1f,news
Study: Eggs for Breakfast Can Help Control Blood Sugar,"British Columbia, Canada—A high-fat, low-carb breakfast (HFLC)—for instance, an omelet—can help those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) control their blood sugar, according to a new study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.The study, titled ""Restricting carbohydrates at breakfast is sufficient to reduce 24-hour exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia and improve glycemic variability,"" is by Courtney Chang et al. It notes that breakfast most often results in the largest postprandial hyperglycemic excursion in those with T2D: Oatmeal, fruit, cereal, and toast—traditional breakfast foods—are often high in glucose.The study was performed on 23 adults with T2D. On one day, the participants consumed a HFLC breakfast; on another, they consumed a breakfast with a more traditional nutrient profile, i.e., 55% of the energy in the meal came from carbohydrates. Lunch and dinner were identical. The participants' glucose was monitored continuously.The HFLC breakfast significantly reduced postprandial hyperglycemia after breakfast (p&lt;0.01). The study also noted that pre-meal hunger was lower before dinner with the HFLC breakfast.In a press release on the topic, Jonathan Little, associate professor at University of British Columbia Okanagan's School of Health and Exercise Sciences and one of the co-authors of the study, noted that preventing the post-breakfast blood sugar spike lowered overall glucose exposure and improved stability of glucose readings for the next 24 hours. ""We expected that limiting carbohydrates would help prevent the spike after this meal,"" he said, ""But we were a bit surprised that the overall glucose control and stability were improved.""The press release added that participants noted lower cravings for sweet foods later in the day when they ate the HFLC breakfast.""The results of our study suggest potential benefits of altering macronutrient distribution throughout the day so that carbohydrates are restricted at breakfast with a balanced lunch and dinner rather than consuming an even distribution and moderate amount of carbohydrates throughout the day,"" Little said. He suggested that this dietary change could be a healthy step for anybody, regardless of whether or not they are living with diabetes.",https://t.co/yypSloUmdN,news
A New Rx for Diabetes: Lighten Up,"Visit after visit, Dr. Pei Chen hoped to persuade a patient with Type 2 diabetes to allow her blood sugar levels to rise. Yes, rise.The woman, who was 84 when she first came to the geriatric clinic at the University of California, San Francisco, had been coping with the disease for decades, following a complex regimen of frequent finger sticks and daily injections involving two types of insulin.Geriatricians often encourage older and frailer patients with diabetes to ease up on efforts to achieve very low blood sugar levels (an approach called ""de-intensification""), pointing out that the balance between benefits and risks shifts with age and illness.You might think those patients would be delighted to take less medication and maybe enjoy the occasional cookie. But older people with diabetes often have long histories of striving to keep their hemoglobin A1c levels (a two- or three-month average measuring blood sugar control) below the once-standard 7 percent.So they may respond the way this patient did. ""She said, 'I've been doing this for 25 years,'"" recalled Dr. Chen, a geriatrician. ""'You don't need to tell me what to do. I can handle it.'""The patient stuck with her routine and kept her A1c and glucose levels very low, an impasse that lasted until her kidneys began to fail, a common complication of diabetes. The metabolic changes of kidney failure, along with her high insulin doses, reduced her blood sugar so severely that she began experiencing frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.""She was feeling lightheaded and nauseated, sweaty,"" Dr. Chen said. Hypoglycemia also increases the risks of falls and fractures. Only at that point did the patient, then 87, agree to relax her insistence on strict control.About a third of Americans over age 65 have diabetes; last month, the Endocrine Society unveiled new guidelines for their treatment.Its recommendations included higher glucose and A1c targets for older people with diabetes, particularly those with several other chronic illnesses and cognitive impairment, or those having difficulty handling daily activities.""This is personalized medicine, taking each patient individually and deciding what's appropriate,"" said Dr. Derek LeRoith, who led the committee that reviewed the evidence and prepared the guidelines. ""You can have a 75-year-old who is healthy and can deal with tight control, but that's probably the minority.""In recent years, a number of medical groups have advocated more moderate blood sugar targets for older patients, including the American Geriatrics Society, the American College of Physicians, the American Diabetes Association and the Veterans Affairs medical system.Having the Endocrine Society also weigh in — its membership includes most endocrinologists treating patients in the United States — may help spread the word.""It's important in shifting the thinking that lower is always better,"" said Dr. Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at the Yale School of Medicine. Her research has shown that overtreatment remains common in older diabetics, most of whom see primary care doctors for their diabetes care.To be clear, none of these groups advises ignoring high blood sugar at older ages. Diabetes can lead to grim complications, from heart attacks and strokes to blindness and amputations. It's also associated with cognitive decline.With lengthening life spans, said Dr. LeRoith, ""we know that 70- to 75-year-olds can live for 10 years or longer"" and reduced blood sugar may help lower their risk of complications. But, he added, ""one should go very slowly with this age group.""Age and life expectancy matter in diabetes treatment because of the so-called time to benefit. ""You need to control blood sugar for five to 10 years before you see real benefits, like reducing the risk of amputation or the need for dialysis,"" Dr. Lipska said.On the other hand, the harms that can accompany treatment show up right away — ""primarily hypoglycemia, but also the risks of polypharmacy, more drugs, more chance for error and more expense,"" Dr. Lipska said. ""They have immediate impact on how people feel and function.""That's why the Endocrine Society guidelines and others recommend lower blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c ranges for older adults in good health, but higher targets for those with other illnesses and limited life expectancies. They likely won't survive long enough to benefit from strict glycemic control; in the meantime, it could hurt them.The Endocrine Society suggests an A1c from 7 to 7.5 percent for the healthiest older people, depending on whether they're taking drugs that can cause hypoglycemia. The ranges increase to 7.5 to 8 percent for those with several chronic illnesses or with early dementia and other impairments, and to 8 to 8.5 percent for those in poor health. The last category includes those with end-stage diseases or moderate to severe dementia, as well as nursing home residents.The guidelines emphasize, however, that reasonable A1c and glucose ranges can vary for individual patients.Those targets still seem too low to some proponents of moderate glycemic control, like Dr. Sei Lee, a geriatrician at U.C.S.F.Dr. Lee, a diabetes treatment researcher, helped draft the American Geriatrics Society's ""Choosing Wisely"" recommendations, which suggested a higher A1c of 8 to 9 percent for those with multiple illnesses and shorter life expectancies.Over all, however, he approves of the Endocrine Society recommendations. ""They're absolutely a step in the right direction, an improvement,"" he said.He thinks the society's 40-page document overemphasizes so-called pre-diabetes, in which people have elevated blood sugar that's not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis. It's been a contentious topic.""I worry we're over-medicalizing, especially for someone in their 80s,"" Dr. Lee said. ""They usually have plenty of other conditions to worry about.""But he appreciates the society's suggestion that instead of following strict diabetic diets, older patients with diabetes should eat healthily and limit simple sugars.""Especially in a nursing home, the range of joys of life gets narrower, and food is one that remains,"" said Dr. Lee. Pushing a restrictive diet simply to lower blood glucose readings can make older people miserable without measurably improving their health.De-intensification for older diabetics has gained traction only slowly — ""a lost opportunity to reduce overtreatment,"" a 2015 study in JAMA Internal Medicine reported.So ""patients should be pushing their physicians on this issue,"" Dr. LeRoith said.Managing diabetes takes considerable work; it's not surprising that patients who've spent years achieving low blood sugar might be reluctant to lessen their vigilance.""We've built a system where they feel good or bad about themselves based on a single number,"" Dr. Lipska said.Dr. Chen's patient, however, eventually agreed that higher blood sugar was preferable to feeling sickened by hypoglycemia. She reduced her insulin dosage and allowed her A1c to climb above 7.Yielding to her family's wishes, she also began dialysis. She died last month at 90.",https://t.co/SpzXL5ACEt,news
Type 2 diabetes: Eating oranges could lower blood sugar,"Type 2 diabetes can trigger symptoms such as excessive thirst, feeling tired and needing to pee a lot. Left untreated, it can lead to long-term health problems involving the nerves, eyes, kidneys and feet, and can lead to cardiovascular disease. But one of the best ways to help manage your blood sugar levels is to eat a healthy diet. This should consist of a wide range of fruit and vegetables and some starchy foods like pasta.Sugar, fat and salt should also be kept to a minimum.One fruit in particular which has been proven to have blood sugar lowering effects is the orange.Research has demonstrated citrus fruits, such as oranges, have anti diabetic effects.Citrus fruits are a great way to get vitamins and minerals without the carbohydrates.Research has shown two bioflavonoid antioxidants, called hesperidin and naringin, are responsible for oranges' antiabetic effects. Other examples of citrus fruit are grapefruits and lemons.Fruits are also a good source of fibre, which has been shown to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. A study published in 2018 suggests a high fibre diet can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 20 to 30 per cent.The research noted this effect came mainly from whole grains or insoluble cereal fibre.Other studies, however, have shown a combination of insoluble and soluble fibre in the diet can be beneficial.Soluble fibre absorbs water, turning it into a gel-like substance, while insoluble fibre doesn't.Alongside fruit, other good source of fibre include:Nuts and seedsWhole grainsLegumesFibre is considered an essential part of the diet, particularly for a person with diabetes.Carbohydrates with high fibre take longer to digest than those in low fibre foods, reducing the chance of a blood sugar spike.Fibre also helps a person feel fuller for longer, making them less likely to overeat (being overweight is a risk factor for the condition developing).Government guidelines published in July 2015 say dietary fibre intake should be 30g a day, as part of a healthy balanced diet.Alongside eating a healthy diet, doing certain exercises can help lower blood sugar.",https://t.co/ZgPcscrZlD,news
Depression May Raise Low Blood Sugar Risk in Diabetics,"By Serena Gordon HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, May 21 (HealthDay News) -- Depression can affect almost every aspect of life, but some of the changes brought about by the disorder can be downright dangerous for those with diabetes. New research has found that people with diabetes who are depressed have more than a 40 percent higher risk of having a severe low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) episode that lands them in the hospital compared to people with diabetes who aren't depressed. ""Depression is a very common accompanying condition for people with diabetes. It's important to know that depression can lead to hypoglycemic episodes,"" said study author Dr. Wayne Katon, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington Medical School in Seattle. ""About one-quarter of all severe drug side effects that lead people to an ER visit or hospitalization are related to dramatic drops in blood sugar. Hypoglycemia is a dangerous and expensive problem. And, for people with diabetes, depression increases the risk of serious hypoglycemia by about 40 percent over five years, and leads to a greater number of hypoglycemic episodes,"" he explained. Results of the study are published in the May/June issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. People with diabetes generally take medication that helps lower their blood sugar levels. These medications can be pills, or in the case of the hormone insulin, injections. However, sometimes these medications work too well, and they drop blood sugar levels too low. It's the glucose (sugar) in the blood that fuels the body and the brain. Without enough glucose, the body and brain can't work properly. If blood sugar levels drop too low, people can pass out. If the hypoglycemic episode is severe enough, people can even die. So, someone living with diabetes has to maintain a balance between the medications they take to lower their blood sugar and what they eat. Other factors, such as physical activity and stress, also can affect blood sugar levels. The study included just over 4,100 people with diabetes. Nearly 500 of these people met the criteria for having major depression during the five-year study period. Continued The average age of the study volunteers was 63, and the average duration of diabetes was 10 years. Most -- 96 percent -- had type 2 diabetes. About one-third were taking insulin to control their diabetes. Just 1.4 percent were experiencing complications of diabetes. In the five years before the study began, 8 percent of those with both depression and diabetes reported having had a severe hypoglycemic episode compared to 3 percent of the non-depressed people with diabetes. During the five-year study, nearly 11 percent of the depressed people with diabetes had a severe hypoglycemic episode compared to just over 6 percent of the non-depressed people with diabetes. The risk of hypoglycemia was unaffected by the type of treatment received. People taking oral medications were just as likely to have a hypoglycemic episode as those taking insulin, according to the study. Overall, people with diabetes who were depressed had a 42 percent greater risk of having a severe hypoglycemic episode, and a 34 percent higher risk of having a greater number of hypoglycemic episodes. Katon said there are two likely explanations for these increased risks. One is that depression leads to psychobiological changes that cause big fluctuations in blood sugar levels, which may make it harder to prevent low blood sugar levels. The other possibility is that depression leads to a lack of interest in the self-care that's necessary to manage diabetes well. ""People who are depressed may be less likely to test their blood sugar levels regularly. They may adhere to their medications less well. They may forget if they've taken them, and then end up taking an additional dose,"" said Katon. Another expert, Eliot LeBow, a therapist with a diabetes-focused practice in New York City, and a type 1 diabetic himself, agreed that ""depression can affect a person's ability to manage their diabetes."" But, he said there was an important piece of information missing from the study: how much diabetes education a person has had. People who've had more diabetes education would probably be less likely to have a severe hypoglycemic episode, LeBow suggested. Continued He also noted that high blood sugar symptoms can look a lot like depression symptoms. ""Sometimes, when you make a few changes in how someone is managing their diabetes, their depression may lift,"" said LeBow. Both experts agree that people with diabetes who are depressed need to get help. And, fortunately, there are treatments available -- psychotherapy and medications. Katon said there are depression medications that don't significantly affect blood sugar levels. According to the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health, depression symptoms include: Long-term sadness, anxiety or hopelessness. Feelings of guilt and worthlessness. A loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. Sleep and appetite changes. Trouble remembering things. Difficulty concentrating or making decisions. Suicidal thoughts. Although the study found an association between depression and greater risk of hypoglycemic episodes, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.",https://t.co/BnWzaG3kRP,news
Victoza® demonstrated superiority in reducing blood sugar vs placebo in children and adolescents wit,"BALTIMORE, April 28, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Novo Nordisk today announced the results from the ELLIPSE trial which examined efficacy and safety and demonstrated superiority of Victoza® (liraglutide) injection 1.8 mg vs placebo in reducing blood sugar in children and adolescents aged 10-17 with type 2 diabetes.1 ELLIPSE is the first phase 3 trial completed in over a decade in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. These data were presented today at the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES)/Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) Annual Meeting in Baltimore, MD and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.2 Victoza® is currently indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. This study was designed to evaluate the investigational use of Victoza® in children and adolescents.The ELLIPSE trial included a 26-week, double-blinded treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period. The trial results showed that, when added to metformin, with or without concurrent basal insulin treatment, Victoza® significantly reduced A1C at both 26 weeks (primary endpoint) and 52 weeks (secondary endpoint), -0.64% and -0.50% respectively, versus placebo, where there was an increase in A1C at both 26 weeks and 52 weeks, +0.42% and +0.80% respectively (p&lt;0.001 for both).2 Additionally, the proportion of children and adolescents achieving A1C &lt;7% at week 26 (secondary endpoint) was significantly higher in those treated with Victoza® (63.7%) than in those treated with placebo (36.5%), p&lt;0.001.2""The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents is increasing, driven by the global epidemic of childhood obesity, yet our treatment options are limited,"" said Dr. William Tamborlane, professor and Chief of Endocrinology, Yale School of Medicine and ELLIPSE lead investigator. ""These data represent a potential new treatment option for lowering blood sugar in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes."" The results of the ELLIPSE trial have been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for evaluation as a potential treatment option for children 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes. ""We are delighted with the ELLIPSE trial results and look forward to discussions with the FDA and EMA about these data for Victoza®,"" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk.

"Increase Blood Platelets, Heal Ulcers And Regulate Blood Sugar Levels With Papaya Leaf Juice","Papaya is a heavenly tropical fruit, pressed with various nutrients and vitamins. This yellowish orange meaty fruit contains many seeds and as indicated by the book ""Mending Foods"" by DK Publishing House, the fruit is known to have antibacterial properties and improves digestion, also every part of the plant can be used.While the fruit is high in nutrients and beta-carotene, its seeds have a sharp peppery flavor and are bottomless in unsaturated fats and papaya oil. However, just a couple of most likely realized that papaya leaves are additionally unimaginably nutritious and can give various medical advantages.Much the same as the fruit, the leaf is high in proteins like papain and chymopapain, which help absorption, and forestall stomach related clutters, while the solid alkaloid mixes like karpain altogether improve hair health.Papaya leaves contain in excess of 50 fixings, including vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin C and vitamin E, manganese, sodium, potassium, iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, carbohydrates, protein, calories and water.Scientists have discovered that the phytonutrient mixes in papaya leaves act in cooperative energy to show an incredible cancer prevention agent and resistant upgrading sway in the circulation system. Papain, alkaloids and phenolic mixes are in charge of their positive natural impacts.Thusly, papaya leaves fortify health in different ways. As a matter of first importance, these leaves increment platelet tally.Platelets (thrombocytes) are platelets which are accountable for the blood thickening procedure. They stick to each other when a vein is harmed, and the platelet ball is reinforced with collagen, calcium, and a couple of other blood segments.In the event that the quantity of platelets is low, the body can't stop the seeping after any harm. The ordinary scope of platelets is 150 to 450 thousand cells for each microliter of blood, and everything beneath 150 thousand cells is viewed as a low platelet tally.The most well-known reasons for low platelet tally incorporate nutrient B12 inadequacy, liver disappointment, extreme parchedness, immune system ailments, a few prescriptions, dengue fever, and Zika infection.Most investigations on the impacts of papaya leaves on platelet include are done on account of dengue fever, as the sickness is broadly spread in similar pieces of the reality where papaya is effectively open.This tropical disease is brought about by the dengue infection and transmitted by mosquitoes, and consistently, 50 to 528 million individuals get determined to have it and 20 thousand individuals bite the dust from it. It is a self-restricting sickness, however it can cause dangerous complexities, for example, platelet pulverization, which rapidly prompts low platelet check, summed up dying, and demise.In any case, a recent report has discovered that 50 ml (under 2 ounces) of papaya leaf squeeze once day by day for 3 days in a row fundamentally raised the dimension of platelets of every one of the 114 subjects.The next year, it was discovered that the utilization of papaya leaf juice for 5 days prompted a five-five-crease increment in platelet check (from 28 to 138 thousand for every micro-liter of blood) in a young fellow experiencing dengue.Likewise, a recent report demonstrated that papaya leaf remove cases were exceptionally viable too, beginning from the third day of organization, and caused no symptoms. Also, papaya leaf separates were observed to be powerful in the treatment of any instance of low platelets, including the ghastly resistant thrombocytopenic purpura. Also, these leaves have various medicinal properties, and can provide many health benefits:Studies have demonstrated that this concentrate can bring down glucose, improve blood cholesterol, and lift the capacity of the liver and pancreas.Being a powerful cell reinforcement, the papaya leaf extricate shields the covering of the stomach from free extreme harm, recuperates peptic ulcers, and treats colon aggravation because of provocative entrail illnesses (IBD). These leaves likewise contain karpain, which demolishes microbes that reason issues like gastritis, while papain, protease catalyst, and amylase chemical in their substance separate proteins, carbs, and mitigate the gastrointestinal (GI ) tract.Papaya leaf juice improves insulin affectability, controls glucose levels, brings down oxidative pressure, and diminishes optional difficulties of diabetes like greasy liver, and kidney harm.A recent report demonstrated that a papaya leaf separate taken in low to direct portions has calming properties, especially in decreasing joint swelling because of joint pain.Papaya leaf separates shield the mind from unusual changes to be determined of flagging particles and may probably treat conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's infections.Vitamin A and vitamin C in papaya leaf juice improve skin health and treat many skin conditions such as bug bites, rashes, acne, bed sores, ringworm, burns and infected cuts.You can utilize this concentrate as a mouthwash to alleviate gum aggravation and treat gum dyingThe concentrate of papaya leaf invigorates hair development, anticipate going bald and diminishing of hair. It is regularly added to hostile to dandruff shampoos because of the nearness of the karpain exacerbate, an alkaloid part that expels earth and oil from your scalp, and reestablishes the sparkly and imperativeness of the hairPapaya leaf juice facilitates the menstrual stream and treats the agony. Its powerful mending properties balance hormones, and control monthly cycle cycles.Make sure that you always follow these tips, if you want to get the most benefits out of the leaves:You can juice them in a juicer, and store away a little jug of the juice in the cooler to be devoured inside 4-5 days.You can pulverize 10 leaves and place them in the blender with some unadulterated drinking water. Mix, and strain a while later utilizing a cheddar or muslin fabric. Note that the juice is very amazing and unpleasant, so you can begin with just a single tablespoon day by day and work up to a limit of two tablespoons. You ought not drink water (or different liquids) following. To build the blood platelet tally, pretty much 50ml (under 2 ounces) multi day of the juice is sufficient.For health improvement, increase only one tablespoon of papaya leaf squeeze day by day.You can set up a tea mixture, by adding 3-5 medium-to-huge leaves to around two liters of water.

"The pointed gourd can lower your blood sugar, help you with cholesterol and prevent tumors, researchers find","Pointed gourd, scientifically known as Trichosanthes dioica, is one of the most commonly consumed vegetables in tropical countries around Asia, particularly in Bangladesh and India. But there's a reason why it's a staple in these countries: It's rich in nutrients and has many potential health benefits.In a recent review, researchers at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Primeasia University, and Stamford University Bangladesh in Bangladesh critically analyzed the findings of scientific studies on pointed gourd.Based on the data they gathered from scientific studies, the vegetable has the potential to lower blood sugar, regulate cholesterol levels, inhibit tumor growth and development, fight inflammation, and prevent digestive problems. It even has the potential to protect against arsenic poisoning. In addition, the researchers identified various types of compounds from pointed gourd, such as peptides like trichosanthin and lectin; triterpenes like cucurbitacin B, euphol, alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, lupeol, taraxerol, betulin, and karounidiol; sterols; steroidal saponin; tannin; and flavonoids.From these findings, the researchers confirm that consuming pointed gourd does contain many bioactive compounds and exhibits various biological activities that are beneficial to health. The findings of the review were published in the journal Food Science and Human Wellness.Pointed gourd leaves help control diabetesThe fruit of the pointed gourd is widely eaten as a vegetable, while its other parts are used in traditional medicine to treat various health problems. In one study, pointed gourd leaves have been shown to lower blood sugar levels by more than 32 percent.The power of the elements: Discover Colloidal Silver Mouthwash with quality, natural ingredients like Sangre de Drago sap, black walnut hulls, menthol crystals and more.

It is also used as a blood purifier, and to address hair loss.Pointed gourd can also help fight signs of skin aging. This vine contains a good amount of vitamins A and C, which act as antioxidants that combat free radical damage that promotes skin aging. Pointed gourd can also aid in weight loss. While it is loaded with nutrients, its is low in calories, which means that it is a great addition to your diet for weight loss. It also keeps you feeling fuller and controls your hunger.Pointed gourd can be prepared in many ways. It can be pickled in vinegar or used as an ingredient for curry, soup, stew, or stir-fry. It can also be cooked with potatoes and served with yogurt or in a vegetable dish known as subzis in the West Indies. Moreover, pointed gourd can be stuffed, or cut into cubes and sautéed, or made into soup.Read more news stories and studies on the health benefits of pointed gourd by going to FoodIsMedicine.com.Sources include:Science.newsHealthBenefitsTimes.comTimesofIndia.IndiaTimes.com",https://t.co/bh2Nsmq8Lk,news
"Type 2 diabetes: Foods to lower blood sugar - nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits and legumes","Type 2 diabetes is a common condition in the UK that can be caused by eating a poor diet, high in saturated fat. Left untreated, it can lead to serious, long-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, as well as damage to the nerves, kidneys, eyes and feet. Eating a healthy diet can help manage a person's blood sugar level, and as part of this, eating foods from a certain food group is recommended.Some evidence has shown fibre can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes.A study published in 2018 suggests a high fibre diet can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 20 to 30 per cent.The research noted this effect came mainly from whole grains or insoluble cereal fibre.Other studies, however, have shown a combination of insoluble and soluble fibre in the diet can be beneficial.Soluble fibre absorbs water, turning it into a gel-like substance, while insoluble fibre doesn't.Four of the best sources of fibre you should consider adding to your diet are:Vegetables and fruitsNuts and seedsWhole grainsLegumesFibre is considered an essential part of the diet, particularly for a person with diabetes.Carbohydrates with high fibre take longer to digest than those in low fibre foods, reducing the chance of a blood sugar spike.Fibre also helps a person feel fuller for longer, making them less likely to overeat (being overweight is a risk factor for the condition developing).Government guidelines published in July 2015 say dietary fibre intake should be 30g a day, as part of a healthy balanced diet.But it was revealed most adults are only eating an average of about 18g a day.The NHS recommends the following ways to increase your fibre intake:Choose a higher-fibre breakfast cereal such as plain wholewheat biscuits (like Weetabix) or plain shredded whole grain (like Shredded wheat), or porridge as oats are also a good source of fibre.Go for wholemeal or granary breads, or higher fibre white bread, and choose wholegrains like wholewheat pasta, bulgur wheat or brown rice.Go for potatoes with their skins on, such as a baked potato or boiled new potatoes. Find out more about starchy foods and carbohydrates.Add pulses like beans, lentils or chickpeas to stews, curries and salads.Include plenty of vegetables with meals, either as a side dish or added to sauces, stews or curries.Have some fresh or dried fruit, or fruit canned in natural juice for dessert. Because dried fruit is sticky, it can increase the risk of tooth decay, so it's better if it is only eaten as part of a meal, rather than as a between-meal snack.For snacks, try fresh fruit, vegetable sticks, rye crackers, oatcakes and unsalted nuts or seeds.Some experts recommended certain supplements to control and prevent type 2 diabetes.",https://t.co/rm9zfSsAbD,news
"World Hypertension Day 2019: Theme, Significance And 10 Best Foods For High Blood Pressure","World Hypertension Day 2019 will be observed on May 17. Hypertension or high blood pressure is a condition in which there is long-term high force of blood against artery walls. The force is high enough to cause numerous health problems like heart disease and stroke. Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood heart pumps and the amount of resistance blood flow in arteries. The more blood your heart pumps, the narrower your arteries and the higher your blood pressure.World Hypertension Day: Theme and significanceThe theme of World Hypertension Day 2019 is ""Know your numbers."" The theme is meant to raise awareness about high blood pressure in people across the world. The idea is to make sure you check your blood pressure regularly and know your numbers in order to necessary action on time.Also read: From Managing High Blood Pressure To Bloating, This Summer Drink Does It AllKnowing your numbers is important because high blood pressure is a condition which does not show any particular symptoms. You can have high blood pressure for years and not know about it because it causes no symptoms. Even without visible symptoms, high blood pressure can cause damage and lead to fatal conditions like heart attack and stroke.Your blood pressure can be at dangerously high levels and still not know. Normal blood pressure levels range between 120/80 to 140/90. If you are above the age of 18, you must check your blood pressure regularly (at least once in 2 months).World Hypertension Day: Normal blood pressure levels range between 120/80 to 140/90Photo Credit: iStock Also read: Suffering From High Blood Pressure? Don't Take Work Stress LightlyA healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet, regular exercise, good amount of sleep and less stress can help you have a normal high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure, you need to avoid consumption of processed and packaged food as they are filled with preservatives and are high in sodium.Consumption of salt must be reduced if you have high blood pressure as salt raises sodium in bloodstream. This can wreck the delicate balance in bloodstream and reduce the ability of kidneys to remove water. This in turn increases blood pressure because of extra fluid and strain on the delicate blood vessels that lead to kidneys.Also, food that have high potassium are beneficial for high blood pressure as it helps in balancing the negative effect of salt.Also read: Melons And Other Mouth-Watering Fruits That Can Help Lower High Blood PressureFollowing is a list of foods that are healthy for people with high blood pressure1.

Ketogenic Diet and Its Physiological Effects on the Human Body,"In this interview, Benjamin Bikman, Ph.D., an obesity and diabetes scientist and associate professor of physiology and developmental biology at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Utah,1 reveals how the ketogenic diet affects your physiology and supports optimal health.""My main interest early on was looking at how the body adapts to obesity,"" he says. ""That was my master's thesis. My master's degree was exercise science here at BYU … I ended up pursuing a Ph.D. in bioenergetics at East Carolina University, under this wonderful scientist named Lynis Dohm, Ph.D.His focus had been looking at how lipids cause insulin resistance. That was an interest of mine, because I thought this was starting to explain why and how the body becomes insulin-resistant in the midst of obesity … Insulin resistance is that connection.During my Ph.D., we were looking at inflammation in people who were losing weight following gastric bypass procedures and how improved inflammation is likely part of the improvements in insulin sensitivity that people see post-bypass.I followed that up with a post-doctoral fellowship at … the Duke National University of Singapore. They had this focus on cardio metabolic disorders. I … looked at inflammation as a particular mediator there … Then in 2011, my alma mater, BYU, came knocking. They wanted to do more diabetes research, and I fit the requirements … That got me, essentially, to where I am now …If I really am getting this conviction, based on my own research, that insulin is key to not only diabetes but to almost every chronic disease, what is the best way to control insulin? That was when I insisted on only looking at published human clinical data — not rodents, not cells, not epidemiology, just clinical data.The low-carb diet was just this very effective way to do that. That then got me interested in asking questions about ketones, which is what my lab is doing … how ketones are regulated by insulin.""Bikman's conviction that insulin is a key to health and disease prevention, and that controlling carbohydrate intake is the most effective way to control insulin, led him to start practicing what he'd learned. He went on a low-carb diet about eight years ago. ""Sure enough, at middle age, it's helped me stay healthy,"" he says.Most Americans Are Insulin ResistantUnfortunately, many, including doctors, still do not understand the influence of insulin on health and disease. The late Dr. Joseph Kraft, former chairman of the department of clinical pathology and nuclear medicine at St. Joseph's Hospital in Chicago, wrote the book ""Diabetes Epidemic and You: Should Everyone Be Tested?""In it, he presents data that suggests 80 percent of Americans are in fact insulin resistant, or have ""diabetes in situ."" Based on data from 14,000 patients,2 Kraft developed a powerful predictive test for diabetes.3 He would have the patient drink 75 grams of glucose, and then measure their insulin response over time, at half-hour intervals for up to five hours.He noticed five distinctive patterns suggesting that a vast majority of people were already diabetic, even though their fasting glucose was normal. Only 20 percent of patients had healthy post-prandial insulin sensitivity and low diabetes risk. According to Kraft, ""Those with cardiovascular disease not identified with diabetes … are simply undiagnosed.""One of the take-home messages here is that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (a condition marked by excess insulin in your blood relative to your level of glucose) are two sides of the same coin, as they drive and promote each other. In other words, if you have hyperinsulinemia, you are essentially insulin resistant and on your way toward developing Type 2 diabetes.AdvertisementHigh Insulin Is a Key Disease PromoterBoth insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia promote fatty liver and high blood glucose, and both of those in turn promote atherosclerosis. High blood pressure is another side effect of insulin resistance that drives atherosclerosis by placing stress on your arteries.The effects of insulin resistance are really at the heart of most if not all chronic degenerative diseases. Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's are just a few of the most obvious ones. The logical conclusion then would be that addressing insulin resistance is a foundational component of effective health care. Bikman says:""When I teach this to my students … I put insulin resistance in the core. Around it, I have all these chronic diseases. It's what I call the 'wheel of misfortune.' Really, the most common cancers, prostate and breast cancers, almost always … will heavily express — by six or seven times — the number of insulin receptors. So, insulin is promoting the growth of the tumor.With dementia, the connection between insulin resistance and Alzheimer's is so tight that people refer to it as Type 3 diabetes. With sarcopenia, we know that if a muscle becomes insulin-resistant, that actually diminishes insulin's ability to promote the anabolic production of proteins within the muscle …We have to have our medical practitioners start appreciating … the utility [of] measuring insulin, because our focus on measuring glucose misses the mark. As someone's becoming insulin-resistant, their insulin is climbing, but it's enough to keep their glucose in check.And because we always look at glucose, we don't catch the disease until they become so insulin-resistant that no amount of their own insulin is enough to keep the glucose in check. Now, the glucose starts to climb — 10 years later, perhaps — and that's when we detect the problem. We're looking at the wrong marker.""How the Ketogenic Diet Improves Insulin SensitivityThe question then becomes, how do we treat insulin resistance? As Bikman's research reveals, the ketogenic diet is part and parcel of the ""cure"" for this condition.""For me, the benefit of a low-carb ketogenic diet is that it addresses the endocrine aspect of metabolic health,"" Bikman says. ""For too long … the message has been completely focused on calorie number.It is this idea that if you can simply put a person into caloric deficiency, they will lose weight — problem solved … But we know that has long-term consequences … There's a lasting metabolic damage …Nevertheless, the power of the low-carbohydrate diet is that it addresses the endocrine component. As important as calorie number is, and I can appreciate the laws of thermodynamics … we cannot ignore the relevance of hormones, especially insulin.""As explained by Bikman, it's important to realize that insulin is what dictates what your body does with the energy it has — the energy you consume and the energy you have stored. ""Insulin has its strong, capable hands right on the steering wheel of what the body does with the energy that it has available,"" he says.Importantly, research shows your metabolic rate increases as insulin decreases. ""To me, that's the power of the low-carb diet. You're controlling insulin, and that can start to address all of those chronic diseases,"" Bikman says.The Importance of Cycling High and Low Carbohydrate IntakeFor all its benefits though, there are drawbacks to staying in chronic nutritional ketosis. Based on the evidence, I'm convinced one needs to pulse or cycle in and out of nutritional ketosis. Bikman, who is in general agreement with this idea, explains:""As a scientist, I wish there were longer-term studies to be able to conclusively say you can't do this long-term or you can. What I'm comfortable saying, with a little bit of speculation, is that … the avoidance of carbohydrates for a prolonged period will create this situation of a relative glucose intolerance.Now, I'm not going to say that causes insulin resistance. Some people say low-carb [diet] causes physiological insulin resistance … To me, a low-carb diet can create a situation of carbohydrate intolerance. That is reflective of a general and very substantial shift in energy use.Insulin is down — that means the body is in fat-burning mode. That is the absolute bioenergetic fuel. If insulin is low, you are fueled with fat. That can create a shift where the body becomes almost reluctant to fuel itself with carbohydrates.That's where you have instances of someone adopting a low-carbohydrate diet, and then they'll eat a carbohydrate load and they'll say, 'Wow, my glucose levels; it's like I've become diabetic.' That's not the same thing. They become glucose-intolerant.If that's something someone wants to avoid for whatever reason, then cyclical [keto] is probably the way to go. You kind of spike the glucose from time to time, maybe weekly, whatever would work best for the person … The idea [is] you have that frequent-enough exposure to carbohydrates so that you can maintain that tolerance to the carbohydrates …""Insulin also suppresses the liver's ability to produce glucose. It impairs gluconeogenesis. What this means is that if your insulin level is too low for too long, your glucose level can start to rise. While this is not universally true for everyone, it can occur, as it did for me. Cycling in and out of ketosis will help you avoid this paradoxical side effect as well. Bikman notes:""I've heard enough people say that. I think it has to be taken seriously. Nevertheless, glucagon [hormone] starts to climb. Insulin's main effect is to take glucose from the blood (or any fuel) and push it into the cells. Glucagon does the opposite. Glucagon wants to mobilize fuel from tissues and push it into the blood.One of glucagon's main actions is to promote the breakdown of stored glycogen to promote the production of glucose in the liver. In that instance, where insulin has gone too low then, theoretically, glucagon could go too high, and that could increase glucose too much … That's kind of reflective, perhaps, of that intolerance I mentioned …With regards to the context of low-carb [causing] glucose to climb over time, it could be due to the lack of insulin, and thus an absence of the inhibition of glucagon production from the pancreas. The pancreas is making too much glucagon. That could potentially be driving up glucose levels.""The Connection Between Gut Bacteria and Liver HealthBikman also summarizes how a high-fiber diet helps combat fatty liver disease, which it does by way of influencing your gut microbiome.""While the human body doesn't get any energetic benefit from the fiber, the bacteria do. The bacteria are able to use the fiber as fuel. One of the products of that is short-chain fatty acids, [such as] butyrate.What's interesting is that as the fiber is being digested by the bacteria to create butyrate, that short-chain fat can get absorbed into the body … [I]t goes right into the portal vein from the gut, right to the liver …Short-chain fatty acids are so stimulatory with regards to mitochondrial biogenesis … that it actually can combat fatty liver disease. It's kind of a fun little paradox of using a fat to fight the fat that's stored in the liver, in the case of fatty liver disease. Nevertheless, that's an odd little connection between gut bacteria and liver health.""Butyric acid (butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by bacteria in your gut) is really similar to the ketone hydroxybutyrate, produced by your liver during the conversion of fat into energy.The primary difference between the two is that hydroxybutyrate isn't as absorbable. Most of it is used locally by colonocytes (epithelial cells of your colon). In other words, hydroxybutyrate is used for fuel in your gut, while butyrate benefits your liver.The Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin — A Driver of Ill HealthThe mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), also known as the mechanistic target of rapamycin, is an incredibly important pathway, as it controls autophagy — your body's natural clean-up process in which old, damaged cells are eliminated and replaced with new, healthy ones. As such, it also plays an important role in aging and cancer.In short, to slow aging and reduce your risk of cancer, you want to inhibit mTOR, as this triggers autophagy. When mTOR is activated, autophagy is deactivated, which prevents the recycling of proteins. Alas, chronic suppression of mTOR is not ideal either. Bikman explains:""What's important with regards to mTOR … is that because it inhibits autophagy, it is thought to allow proteins and just organelles, parts of the cells, to get old due to things like oxidative damage. As those proteins get damaged, they get old, and then the cell, by extension, gets old.As the cells get old, so too is the organ, and then the whole body … But … the body has been designed with far too clever a scheme to have something that shouldn't be there; mTOR is so fundamental to life that you can't just go in and just slam the breaks on it, because that is death. We have to grow. We have to allow a cell to grow, and tissue to grow.This idea [is to] optimize or strategically focus on boosting mTOR and letting it come back down to keep the body young, to keep the cells cleaning themselves out through autophagy … Then you inhibit that and allow the body to grow with this cyclical spike of mTOR.A lot of the focus … among vegetarians … is this idea that you've got to avoid animal protein because it spikes mTOR. That's the wrong way of looking at it … What spikes mTOR the most and the longest? Insulin spikes mTOR far more than amino acids do.""Insulin Activates mTOR to a Far Greater Degree Than ProteinIn other words, sugar/carbohydrates are the No. 1 enemy when it comes to activating mTOR and driving the aging and disease processes. According to Bikman, a direct comparison in tissue shows insulin spikes mTOR three to four times higher than leucine, the amino acid that has the greatest impact on mTOR, raising it the most.Importantly, while amino acids such as leucine, or protein in general, will spike mTOR for 45 to 90 minutes, after which mTOR dials back down, if you eat lots of starchy, sugary foods, you have chronically elevated insulin and hence chronically activated mTOR, and that's what's causing problems.""If you look at the global breakfast trends, it's going to be something starchy and sugary. Insulin will come up, depending on the person, [and stay elevated for] two to even four hours; mTOR is active that whole time. Then, right as the insulin is coming down, they have a mid-morning snack.Of course, it's another starch and it's another sugar. Insulin comes up again and it's up for hours. Of course, as insulin is up, so too is mTOR. That, I submit, is far more pathological — this chronic, every-waking-moment mTOR activation because of insulin, rather than these intermittent spikes of mTOR because of the ingestion of protein.""The Benefits of Intermittent FastingAside from a ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting — where you do not eat for 16 to 18 hours a day; 12 hours being the absolute minimum — is another effective way to regain your insulin sensitivity and control mTOR.Basically, while you're fasting, your insulin will dramatically drop, allowing your body to enter into autophagy and clean itself out. Then, when you refeed, your body deactivates autophagy and starts to rebuild itself.Dr. Jason Fung, a nephrologist, recently published a case series paper4 on three diabetic patients — all of whom were on high doses of insulin — detailing how intermittent fasting can be used as a therapeutic alternative for Type 2 diabetes.Of the three patients, two did alternating-day 24-hour fasts, while one fasted for 24 hours three times a week over a period of several months. On nonfasting days, they were allowed both lunch and dinner, but all meals were low in sugar and refined carbohydrates throughout. (The complete manual of the fasting regimen used is described in Fung's book, ""The Complete Guide to Fasting.""5)Two of the patients were able to discontinue all of their diabetes medications while the third was able to discontinue three of his four drugs. All three also lost between 10 and 18 percent of their body weight. Incredibly, all were able to discontinue their insulin in just five to 18 days. Bikman comments:""From the context of controlling insulin, there are studies on insulin-resistant people where they are on isocaloric diets, so the same amount of calories, but one is eating them frequently in smaller amounts and one is packing them in a smaller window …Those on the time-restricted eating schedule … had greater drops in glucose and insulin. That, to me, is the beginning and end. As a guy who sees the relevance of insulin in any chronic disease … I just simply ask, what controls insulin?Simply give your body a break from eating. Twelve hours should be what everyone does every night of the week, even if they're eating three full meals. At least get that 12-hour break, for heaven's sake.As a professor, I see kids who live on cold cereal. They're eating three bowls of cereal at midnight. [Then] they have the same three bowls of cereal at 7 or 8 a.m. I hear them, of course. They're smug, 'I can eat whatever I want.' I say, 'Let's see how you're doing in 10 years.'""The reason you want to avoid eating for 16 to 18 hours is because you cannot effectively deplete the glycogen stores in your liver otherwise. As noted by Bikman, your liver will hold, on average, 100 grams of glycogen, and it takes anywhere between 24 and 48 hours to burn that up.What this means is that if you're eating a high-carb diet and want to get into ketosis, you'll need to totally restrict carbohydrates or fast for at least 24 hours. Once you start running out of glycogen, your ketones will start to rise to take its place as a fuel for your body. Around 48 hours, you're solidly in ketosis as the glycogen in your liver has been cleared.On a side note, fasting will also release fat-bound toxins and facilitate detoxification. As noted by Bikman, ""as insulin comes down, your urine production starts to increase,"" as your kidneys start to flush out toxins. Industrial Seed Oils — Another Culprit That Drives DiseaseThe devil's in the details, of course, and the main problems are caused not only by refined carbohydrates in the Western processed food diet but also by processed seed oils, which Bikman describe as ""surprisingly pathogenic.""""We've just started a project in my lab. I've got a really sharp undergraduate who's focusing on the main oxidized product of seed oils,"" he says. ""When you look at that main omega-6 and how it gets oxidized through this molecule called 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), we're looking at how it accumulates in muscle cells.It is forcing these changes in the way the mitochondria are physically put together. Mitochondria love to be very dynamic. They're long and stringy. They'll separate often to small pieces then come back together. Not all have a very relevant physiological purpose with regards to cell growth and division.Yet, in the case of 4-HNE accumulation, that process gets stopped. Now you've forced this sustained static state of the mitochondria, which is not healthy for them or the cell. I can't say anything more about it yet just because we don't have all the data yet, but it's coming.""Ketones — A Surrogate Marker for InsulinWhile measuring insulin is really valuable, you need a doctor's order to test it. Fortunately, there's a good surrogate marker for insulin, namely your ketone level, because you cannot have high insulin if you have high ketones. In other words, ketones are an inverse indicator of what your insulin is. (One of the best ketone devices I know of is Keto-Mojo, as the strips are only $1 each.)""That was my initial interest in ketones, because it provided that immediate marker of what insulin is, even in a way that glucose cannot. You can have normal glucose levels and have insulin be elevated. If you're insulin-resistant, you just need more insulin to keep your glucose normal, so you can't rely on glucose.In a way, ketones then become more sensitive as a marker, a surrogate for insulin, than even glucose is. Over time, if someone's had their insulin levels in control for a sufficient period, their liver is basically burning fat at such a high rate that it's burning more fat than it needs, and so the body has this very kind of clever release or exhaust valve, which is the production of ketones,"" Bikman says.""We have to account for how energy is consumed, how it is used in the form of creating ATP or just body heat — even that's relevant in ketosis — but then third, for lack of a better word, this energy wasting, because ketones provide this kind of exhaust valve where the body is burning fat so high that it has more than it needs, and it just starts moving it out of the body, in the breath and in the urine.That needs to be considered, or at least acknowledged … Once again, insulin dictates what the body does with the energy that it has, including producing ketones and having them basically be wasted from the body.""When and What to Eat When ExercisingClearly, your diet is far more important than exercise when it comes to controlling your insulin and overall health. That said, I don't think you can achieve optimal health unless you integrate exercise. The practical question is, ""What and when should you eat when you exercise?"" My conclusion is that protein is a necessary component of a post-workout meal, and that it's best to exercise in a fasted state. Bikman agrees, saying:""With regards to protein, it is without a doubt relevant to someone doing endurance or resistance exercise. You need to make sure you get enough protein. But it appears to be no magic window with that. Basically, you don't have to get it 45 minutes or an hour after your workout. Essentially, within a 24-hour window, if you've eaten sufficient protein, then you're okay.Now, with regards to carbohydrate, there was a very neat study done with college students, where they had them exercise and then their next meal was a carbohydrate-rich meal in one group. In the other group, they fasted through that next meal … The group that ate the high-carb diet … did not have an improvement in insulin sensitivity.By ending their exercise and then having the next meal be a high-carb meal, that undid the improvements in insulin sensitivity from the exercise itself. That has ramifications, because so often someone gets done exercising and they reward themselves with something like juice at some smoothie joint, or they indulge themselves.They treat themselves with some carbohydrates thinking, 'I spent it, so I need to eat it.' What a shame. They are directly preventing some of the insulin-sensitizing benefit of the exercise, because of what they ate …Like you, I prefer to exercise fasted … I don't like having something in my gut when I'm trying to push my blood to my muscles … That blood has to come from the gut.You basically are creating this little war, this hemodynamic war where during exercise and yet having eaten something, your body is thinking, 'Wait a minute. I need to be sending blood into my guts to help move this food through the intestines and digest it. But now, my muscles are active, so I've got to push the blood to my muscles.'You're creating this split, forcing the body to prioritize where the blood wants to go. But if you leave the food in the gut, that's going to start to develop some gastrointestinal discomfort.""The Importance of Leucine Post-ExerciseOne of the most important protein sources when you're exercising is the amino acid leucine. Interestingly, and paradoxically, leucine actually activates autophagy, even though it also activates mTOR, which logically says would result in autophagy being inhibited. This paradox likely has to do with the fact that leucine is ketogenic, meaning it can turn into a ketone, and ketones activate autophagy.Leucine is so effective for muscle building, research cited by Bikman shows just 5 grams of leucine is enough to maximize muscle protein synthesis in people on an otherwise protein-deficient diet. When it comes to leucine supplements, hydroxymethylbutyrate (HBM) is a breakdown product of leucine that you can take. However, it's more expensive, and according to Bikman's reading of the literature, it has no added benefits over leucine itself.""Just leave it on the store shelf. Don't spend that higher amount. It is more money than leucine. Just stick with the leucine,"" he says. ""Leucine is one of the so-called ketogenic amino acids. It can, in fact, take that carbon skeleton of the leucine and turn it into a ketone.Some amino acids are referred to as glycolytic, where they can come in and basically turn into alanine. They can readily turn into glucose as needed. Leucine is one of the ketogenic ones, [which] can turn into ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate in particular. I'd say that if there's any benefit to HMB, you're going to get that anyway, because the leucine is going to become HMB.""Collagen Does Not Count as a Protein SourceAs a general rule, to optimize mTOR, you'll want to restrict your protein intake to about 0.5 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass (not total body weight), or 1 gram of protein per kilo of lean mass. The elderly may need up to 25 percent more.When calculating your protein intake, keep in mind you do not need to include collagen in your calculations, as it does not have the full complement of amino acids to be considered a complete protein. Collagen — provided it's a high-quality, organic grass fed source — is important for the health of your connective tissue, and will help prevent injuries. So, while you don't want to have excess protein, you almost get a free pass with collagen.""Collagen [contains] a different bunch of amino acids,"" Bikman explains. ""One in particular is hydroxyproline, one of the main building blocks for collagen in the body. I've had people kind of challenge that idea and say, 'Well, but when you eat these proteins, even in the form of collagen, it will degrade into the amino acids. The body will just kind of choose whatever amino acids it wants to put back together to make whatever proteins it wants.'That's generally true. There is a very neat rat study. We just have to assume the same thing holds in humans. I think it's a safe assumption here. They had the rats eat a radio-labelled hydroxyproline, so they could basically follow that hydroxyproline around.Sure enough, it went to the skin and to the connective tissue. They could detect where it was enriched. It was all this connective tissue-rich or collagen-rich tissue in the body. I am an advocate of collagen. The evidence supports it. It's especially relevant to someone who adheres to a low-carb diet. Vitamin C is called C for collagen.What's important is that if you're eating less vitamin C, it's comforting to know that you're fulfilling that need essentially by getting not only the collagen itself from the meat that you're eating, that connective tissue and that hydroxyproline and the other amino acids relevant to collagen, but also carnitine, which is relevant to the function and production of collagen within the body.Even a low-carb person, who's avoiding vitamin C, can rest assured their joints and connective tissues are going to be OK, because they're actually directly eating what they need rather than having the body make what they need with the help of vitamin C.""",https://t.co/7Q85BJTR5V,news

Summer diet for type 2 diabetes: Try these 5 hydrating foods to keep your blood sugar in check,"Summer diet for type 2 diabetes: Try these 5 hydrating foods to keep your blood sugar in check&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbspPhoto Credit:&amp;nbspThinkstock New Delhi: Summer has set in and the evenings are longer. This means more opportunities to enjoy picnics, pools, and days out at the beach with family and friends. But for people with type 2 diabetes, eating and drinking can present a few challenges- from how to deal with cravings for sugar and unhealthy foods to tackling fluctuations in blood sugar levels caused by the scorching heat.Yet, having diabetes doesn't have to stop you from enjoying parties and festivals. One of the best things you can do for your health is to drink plenty of water and consume more of hydrating foods that won't spike your blood sugar. It has been shown that dehydration can lead to higher levels of sugar in the blood, which may worsen your condition. Here are some of the best foods diabetics can eat to stay cool, keep their blood sugar under control.CucumbersNon-starchy vegetables like cucumbers are some of the best options for people with diabetes. They are lower in calories and carbohydrates but packed full of fibre, nutrients, antioxidants that won't raise your blood sugar. Coming in at about 96 per cent water, cucumbers are an excellent hydrating option that boosts your health in many ways.CeleryYou might want to keep celery on hand because it's jam-packed with nutrients, some of which may help prevent type 2 diabetes. For instance, the vitamin K in celery has been shown to reduce inflammation, which may increase sensitivity to insulin and improve glucose metabolism. What's more, celery is composed of about 95 per cent water and contains a significant amount of fibre, which does not raise blood sugar levels.SpinachLeafy greens like spinach and lettuce can be very hydrating. They are low in calories, fat and carbs, but high in fibre, nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Rich in phytochemicals and containing about 91 per cent water, spinach has a low glycemic index, meaning eating the vegetable will help support stable blood glucose levels.Bell peppersBell peppers are another great hydrating food that provides good amounts of fibre, nutrients, and antioxidants. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, they are also a great source of potassium, which is helpful for regulating heart function, digestion, and muscular function. Coming in at about 94 per cent water, bell peppers are relatively low in calories and carbs, making them an excellent diabetes food.ApplesApples are a nutritious fruit that contains fibre and nutrients, which may help prevent spikes in blood sugar and insulin. Apples contain sugar but it has little effect on blood sugar levels - the type of sugar found in apples is fructose. While apples contain carbs, which can raise glucose levels, the fibre in the fruit can help stabilise blood sugar in addition to providing numerous health benefits.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

"Kimchi Benefits Include Weight Loss, Lowering Blood Pressure, and More","Kimchi Benefits Include Weight Loss, Lowering Blood Pressure, and More Kimchi benefits, the traditional mix of fermented vegetables that is an indispensable component of Korean cuisine, are just beginning to be uncovered by modern scientific research. If you're a fan of Korean cuisine, you might already be familiar withÂ kimchi, a mixture of salted and fermented vegetables, because it has beenÂ a staple for centuries. But if it's your first time readingÂ about it,Â you'll be glad to discover that kimchi benefits not only those at risk of heart disease and diabetes, but also for those looking to lose weight, improve digestion, promote skin health, and so much more.Kimchi is a Nutritious Vegetable Probiotic FoodKimchi is a low-calorie, low-fat, nutrient-dense source of vitamins (especially vitamin C and beta-carotene), minerals, fiber, important phytochemicals (including beta-sitosterol, sulfur compounds, and capsaicin), and, perhaps most importantly, numerous probiotic strains (including Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis).[1] Researchers have compared kimchiÂ to yogurt, stating that kimchi can be considered a vegetable probiotic food, while yogurt is a health-promoting dairy probiotic food.[1]Kimchi Benefits for Weight LossStudies have reported numerous health benefits of kimchi and other fermented vegetables. For instance, eating kimchi can help obese people decrease body weight, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and percentage of body fat.[2]Do you want to eat foods that help you feel better, stay slim, and avoid diet-related diseases? Do you want to be healthier by eating delicious ""super foods?If so, claim your FREE copy, right now, of the definitive nutrition guide on living a longer, healthier, happier life.Kimchi benefits also improve a number of metabolic factors associated with being overweight that increase your risk of heart disease and diabetes: fasting blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure.[2] In diabetic rats, kimchi improves insulin function and lowers average blood glucose levels.[3] In healthy young people, kimchi helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar.[4]Other Kimchi Benefits Besides its effect on weight, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar, kimchi benefits that have been reported in the scientific literature include:Increased antioxidant status [4]Protection from asthma [5]Anti-aging properties [1,6]Anti-cancer benefits [1,7]Protection from atherosclerosis [8]Anti-constipation effects [1]Colon health promotion [1]Brain health promotion [1]Skin health promotion [1]Immune Stimulating Kimchi Benefits Need Further StudyOne of the other possible benefits of eating kimchi is immune system stimulation, potentially decreasing the risk of viral infections such as the flu. In animals, kimchi stimulates the growth of immune cells such as spleen cells, bone marrow cells, thymus cells, and B cells.[9] The probiotic strain lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kimchi increases the production of immunoglobulin A (IgA), an antibody that plays a critical role in immunity, in mice.[9]Only one human study, which was small and of short duration (4 weeks), has examined the immune effects of kimchi in humans.[9] Results did not show any clear effects of kimchi on the immune systems of healthy college students. Further studies that are larger and of longer duration are needed to determine the immune enhancing effects of kimchi.Utilizing Kimchi Benefits There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi, each with varying types of fermented vegetables, seasonings, and cooking methods. Tastes range from bland to spicy. Good kimchi is often described as having a balanced sour, salty, and spicy flavor and has a crunchy texture. Experiment to find brands and varieties that suit your taste, but make sure you're purchasing fermented kimchi, as non-fermented varieties are also available.

3 Awesome Benefits of a Keto Diet for Type 1 Diabetics,"Previously, I have documented how the keto diet helped my Type 1 diabetic husband gain better blood sugar control. We dispelled the myth that a keto diet is not safe for T1's. If anything it is safer than the traditional high carb diet he had been put on by his diabetes nurses and, sadly, was on for the past 26 years. I say sadly because thinking of the internal damage due to glycation caused by his blood sugar constantly getting spiked by all those carbs makes me cringe, though he has been quite lucky compared to many who have had T1 for the same amount of time. Or maybe 'lucky' isn't the right word to use here since he does take very good care of himself with regular physical exercise which would have helped reduce some of the damage, at least.Though the ketogenic diet was the original therapeutic diet for diabetics back in the day of Dr Banting, somehow science got completely off track with how to correctly treat diabetics. Thanks to the pioneering spirit of people like Dr Bernstein, we are now able to rein in this runaway blood sugar roller coaster once more. This roller coaster is no doubt fuelled by Big Pharma who want to continue to sell very expensive medical products in amounts that are not really needed if people only learn to control their blood sugar through their diet…More Evidence That Keto Works for T1 DiabeticsWorking primarily to the directives laid out by Dr Bernstein in this book, my husband's blood sugars have changed from this… …to this:Top 3 Benefits of Being on a Keto Diet for T1'sI asked my husband what the main benefits of the ketogenic way of eating were and he shared the following top three benefits:Better control in terms of near normal levels thanks of hypos (from 2-3 a day to maybe one every other week)Better control in terms of near normal blood sugar levels thanks to lack of hypos and the fear of themGreater sense of freedom in general thanks to getting off the blood sugar roller coaster. For instance, he can now go for an after dinner walk without fearing a hypo etc.When faced with a chronic illness like T1 diabetes, it is very easy to feel as if the whole situation is out of your control. Sadly some people in the medical profession prey on this feeling and they do so because they are in the pockets of Big Pharma. Take back control today! If my husband could do it after 26 years, then so can you!Love &amp; Light,Lisa",https://t.co/pKA3hPg9jc,news
Type-2 diabetes symptoms: Eat this to lower your blood sugar levels,"Type-2 diabetes is a common condition which causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to increase.According to the NHS, symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination and rapid weight loss.However, there are plenty of ways to reduce blood sugar levels, including what you eat and drink everyday.So what can add in your diet to help control type-2 diabetes? Many breads are high in carbohydrates which can raise blood sugar levels.But pumpernickel bread and 100% stone-ground wholewheat breads have low GI scores.GI stands for glycemic index and is a relative ranking of carbs in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.Pumpernickel and stone-ground whole wheat breads also have lower GI scores than regular whole wheat bread. ""Choosing wholegrain options makes sense""Diabetes UKFibre slows digestions and can help to stabilise blood sugar levels, which is good for type-2 diabetes sufferers.Diabetes UK said: ""Choosing wholegrain options makes sense.""They are high in fibre and keep you feeling fuller for longer than refined carbohydrates and take longer for the blood to break down so blood glucose levels do not 'spike' then drop rapidly.""But if you don't like pumpernickel bread, wholegrain, granary and rye bread are also recommended.Other carbohydrates include wholewheat or brown pasta and noodles, basmati or wild rice, porridge oats or muesli, and quinoa, burger wheat, couscous or yam.Are you worried about developing type-2 diabetes? It is advised to visit your local GP. TYPE-2 DIABETES: Symptoms include weight loss, frequent urination and extreme thirst (Pic: GETTY STOCK IMAGE) Alternatively, it is important to keep an eye on the following symptoms:1.

Type 2 diabetes: Lower blood sugar and reduce the risk of diabetes problems with four tips,"Diabetes is a condition in which a person has too much sugar in their blood. In type 2 diabetes, which is the most common type of the disease, this happens because the body can't produce enough insulin or the insulin produced is rejected by the body's cells. Insulin is needed to transfer sugar from the blood to the cells to be turned into energy, and if it can't do this it leads to diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has been linked to being overweight and making certain, unhealthy lifestyle choices.This means, however, the chance of developing it and the risk of problems occurring if you already have it can be reduced by making healthy lifestyle changes.Two pharmacists at LloydsPharmacy, Pareena Patel and Anshu Bhimbat, share with Express.co.uk four expert things you can do to reduce your blood sugar level:Cut your salt intakeConsuming too much salt can raise blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke - both of which are closely linked to diabetes.Always try to purchase food with the 'no salt added' label. This means no salt is added during the processing, although the product is not necessarily salt or sodium-free, as it doesn't account for food's natural salt or sodium content.Try to compare nutrition labels on food packaging when doing your food shopping. You can cut down your salt intake significantly by simply checking the label and choosing tinned goods, sauces or breakfast cereals that are lower in salt.Try the Dukan dietThe Dukan diet is a short four-week programme low in starchy carbs and fats, which is why it can be beneficial for those at risk of type 2 diabetes.The diet contains four key phases where each week you can introduce additional foods. It can help promote weight loss in a short space of time, which ultimately can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Once you have finished the programme, you should try and cut down on starchy carbs as these are well known to cause blood sugar level spikes. This is because carbs are broken down into sugar when digested.Have regular health checksHealthy levels of cholesterol are important to our overall health, however if we have too much bad cholesterol, it can impact the healthy blood flow within the body, potentially leading to blood clots.It is especially important for those at risk of type 2 diabetes to manage their cholesterol levels.A regular health check will allow you to understand your levels and make appropriate dietary and lifestyle changes, to reduce any other future health complications.Get to know GIsIt's important to learn about the type of carbs that are likely to affect your blood sugar the most, so you can work to cut these out to help reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.The glycaemic index (GI) can tell you which foods will make your blood sugar spike. It measures the effect foods containing carbs have on blood glucose levels.Where possible, avoid foods with a high GI as they are absorbed quickly, which can raise blood glucose.High GI foods include white bread, potatoes and some breakfast cereals. Low GI foods include sweet potatoes and yam, beans, lentils, oatmeal and granary bread. Try and substitute high GI foods for low GI foods.Diabetes: Four common symptomsDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.There are two main types - type 1, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells, and type 2, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin.Type 2 is more common that type 1, with 90 per cent of all diabetics in the UK having type 2.Frequent urinatingGoing to the toilet a lot more than usual, especially at night, is a common sign of diabetes.Urinating frequently is also a sign of other medical issues, such as prostate problems, so be sure to visit your GP to have diabetes confirmed.ThirstExcessive thirst, otherwise known as polydipsia, is a classic sign of diabetes. It is linked to frequent urination.As excess glucose builds up in the blood, the kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter and absorb the excess sugar, and if they can't keep up, the excess sugar is excreted in to urine, taking along fluids from body tissue.This triggers more urination, which may leave diabetics dehydrated.Blurred visionHigh levels of blood sugar can cause the lens inside the eye to swell, which can result in blurred eyesight.Very low blood sugar levels can also cause blurred vision.Weight lossIf you aren't trying to lose weight, and you notice a loss of muscle bulk or the numbers on the scales drop, this could be a sign of diabetes.This happens because insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood to the cells to use as energy.The body will then start burning fat and muscle for energy, causing weight loss.",https://t.co/AikADzfAd7,news

Breakfast options for diabetics that will help maintain blood sugar levels,"Many breakfast foods boast impressive health claims but some are in fact loaded with sugar and refined carbohydrates. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock Images)Breakfast is considered to be the most import meal of the day, which is why we must ensure that it is healthy and nutritious. But if you are a diabetes patient, you need to take extra care to ensure that your sugar intake is limited.According to Express UK, a study published by an associate professor at UBC Okanagan's School of Health and Exercise Science, Jonathan Little, found that breakfast with high-fat and low-carbohydrates can help control blood sugar levels throughout the day. Many breakfast foods boast impressive health claims, but are in fact loaded with sugar and refined carbohydrates.""The large blood sugar spike that follows breakfast is due to the combination of pronounced insulin resistance in the morning in people with Type 2 diabetes and because typical western breakfast foods – cereal, oatmeal, toast and fruit are high in carbohydrates,"" says the study.It suggests that items like cereals, grains, white bread, along with some fruits such as mango, pear and banana, sweetened yoghurt, fruit juice should be avoided.According to the American Diabetes Association, ""Eating foods at breakfast that have a low glycemic index may help prevent a spike in blood sugar all morning — and even after lunch. Eating peanut butter or almond butter at breakfast, for example, will keep you feeling full, thanks to the combination of protein and fat"".So what can type 2 diabetes patients eat in the morning that will help keep their blood sugar levels under control?* Avoid sugar-laden coffee drinks.

This Common Diabetes Blood Test May Be Producing Inaccurate Results,"Share on PinterestA study indicated that a common blood sugar level test missed 73 percent of diabetes cases. Getty ImagesA commonly used blood test may not be the best way to diagnose diabetes.Researchers say testing blood sugar levels for type 1 or type 2 diabetes without also testing for glucose tolerance can miss nearly three-quarters of all cases of these chronic diseases.The hemoglobin A1C blood test ""should not be solely used to determine the prevalence of diabetes,"" said Dr. Maria Mercedes Chang Villacreses, a postdoctorate fellow at the City of Hope's Diabetes and Metabolism Research Institute in California. ""It should be used in conjunction with the oral glucose test for increased accuracy.""Chang Villacreses led a study on the accuracy of diabetes testing that was presented at the recent annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in New Orleans.The hemoglobin A1C test shows the average level of blood sugar over a two- to three-month period. It is used to monitor the blood sugar of people known to have diabetes, but it is also a common test for diagnosing type 1 and type 2 diabetes because it doesn't require any patient preparation, such as fasting.The glucose tolerance test, on the other hand, is given after an overnight fast and again two hours later after the person consumes a sugary drink. People also must limit their carbohydrate consumption for several days prior to testing. The test measures the body's response to glucose.The study led by Chang Villacreses found that the A1C test missed 73 percent of the diabetes cases later detected by the glucose tolerance test. ""The A1C test said these people had normal glucose levels when they didn't,"" she said. ""Our results indicated that the prevalence of diabetes and normal glucose tolerance defined solely by A1C is highly unreliable, with a significant tendency for underestimation of the prevalence of diabetes and overestimation of normal glucose tolerance.""The study included 9,000 adults who didn't have a diabetes diagnosis at the time of testing. Researchers first administered the A1C test, then the oral glucose tolerance test.The A1C test was especially deficient at detecting diabetes in Hispanic and non-Hispanic black participants, researchers reported.Chang Villacreses told Healthline that researchers suspect that these study subjects may have underreported anemia and other blood diseases that are more prevalent among these racial groups.However, she said more research is needed on this issue.The A1C is considered the frontline test for diabetes, having first been recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2010, according to Dr. David B. Sacks, a member of the College of American Pathologists' Clinical Chemistry Resources Committee.The test is useful for long-term detection of blood sugar because glucose binds with red blood cells and remains affixed for up to 120 days, he said.Chang Villacreses said that the A1C test has become the standard analysis because it's much easier to administer than the glucose tolerance test, which requires people to spend a minimum of two hours in the lab.""Not everyone has that kind of time,"" she said.""The A1C test is much easier but not as accurate,"" said Chang Villacreses. ""We suggest that care of each patient has to be individualized.""For example, she said, follow up with the glucose tolerance test when people at high risk of diabetes because of age, weight, diet, inactivity, family history, or other risk factors test negative on an A1C test.""That's a very practical solution and I'd definitely support that,"" said Sacks.He also suggested that doing a fasting glucose test — which requires only a single blood test and a shorter fasting window — in conjunction with the A1C tests could yield more accurate results.People with an A1C blood sugar level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests are considered to have diabetes. An A1C blood sugar of between 5.7 and 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes. Below 5.7 is considered normal, according to ADA guidelines.With the glucose tolerance test, a blood sugar level of less than 140 mg/dL is considered normal. Between 140 and 199 mg/dL is considered prediabetes, and more than 200 indicates diabetes.Chang Villacreses stressed that the A1C remains a ""great test"" for monitoring blood-sugar levels among people already diagnosed with diabetes.Sacks noted that some research suggests that the A1C test also may be useful for identifying individuals whose health is most at risk if they develop diabetes.""The real reason we test for diabetes is to prevent complications, many of which are irreversible,"" he said. ""If we detect diabetes early enough, we can prevent these complications or at least slow them down.""Some studies have suggested that ""people who are above the cutoff for A1C are more likely to develop complications than those who exceed the cutoff for glucose tolerance,"" Sacks continued.Therefore, the relatively higher accuracy of the more cumbersome glucose tolerance test ""may not really matter for a lot of people because they may not develop complications.""""It is clear that the glucose test picks up more people,"" said Sacks. ""The question is whether it matters from a practical standpoint.""The most commonly used blood test for diabetes is far less accurate than glucose tolerance testing, researchers are reporting.In a recent study, researchers reported that the A1C test missed 73 percent of cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes that were later picked up by a glucose monitoring test.Experts say people at high risk of diabetes should get confirmatory tests even if A1C results are negative.",https://t.co/DNKWFFfm7e,news
Diabetes Burnout,"Posted by Kathleen Hoffman on May 20, 2018 in Blog, Diabetes mellitus | ""I just don't think about my diabetes. It's too complicated and I'm too busy.""""I've given up on carb counting and just eat whatever.""""If my blood sugar is out of range, I just don't care.""""Family and friends don't support me. """"I feel hopeless.""If these statements sound familiar – like the way you've been feeling – you are not alone. Living with a chronic condition is challenging and can be exhausting. It is not surprising that many people experience fatigue and burnout.For people with diabetes, there are physiological reasons for the fatigue.Â Hypo- and hyperglycemia, glucose variability are factors that can impact the central nervous system.Likewise, there is a significant amount of self-management involved in living with diabetes.The pancreas is an integral part of a complex system.Â When it is functioning properly, the amounts of insulin are perfectly attuned to the needs of the body. Expecting this type of perfection in someone whose pancreas is not functioning properly or in someone whose body cells are resistant to insulin, is not reasonable.Â Controlling diabetes, being a pancreas, is not truly possible. Unfortunately, expectations of this kind may be part of your experience with diabetes.In fact, in people living with type 2 diabetes who are compelled to start using insulin treatment can feel that they have ""failed. In fact, the language around diabetes is about ""control or ""mastering diabetes. Negative experiences can add up, low self-esteem can result and the cumulative effect is diabetes burnout. If there is a lack of help or social support from family and friends, burnout is likely to be even worse. What to do when you are experiencing burnoutUtilize technologyKeeping up with the numbers in your head can be too much and can become a significant burden. There are a number of apps available to help with carb counting. Medication management and stay on schedule as well as blood sugar trackers that track carbs, insulin and exercise can help.Get HelpNegative emotions and intense feelings need to be expressed but also effectively processed. Therapy can be useful to help with dealing with feelings depressive feelings or feelings of being at a loss.Stress ReductionWhen you experience stress, hormones like epinephrine and cortisol are released. These hormones activate the release of glucagon from the pancreas. Glucagon tells your liver to break down the glycogen it has been storing into glucose which is released into your blood. This is one way that stress affects your blood sugar. Meditation and physical activity that reduces stress are effective ways to help manage diabetes. There are mobile apps that provide guided medications to help you to reduce stress.Celebrate the small winsDon't dwell on the problems. Celebrate the small wins that you have.

To Optimize Your Blood Sugar Level,"Insulin is essential to staying alive; unfortunately, the vast majority of people have resistance to this essential hormone, speeding up the aging process and contributing to the development of degenerative diseases. Any meal high in grain and sugar carbs typically generates a rapid rise in blood glucose.To compensate, your pancreas secretes more insulin into your bloodstream to lower your blood sugar. Insulin, however, is also very efficient at lowering blood sugar by turning it into fat. The more you secrete, the more fat your body will accumulate.If you consistently consume a high-sugar, high-grain diet, your blood glucose level will be correspondingly high and over time your body becomes desensitized to insulin, requiring more and more of it to get the job done. Eventually, you become insulin resistant and prone to weight gain, and then full-blown diabetic.Prediabetes1 is defined as an elevation in fasting blood glucose between 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and 125 mg/dl. At 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, it formally becomes Type 2 diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 84.1 million American adults — about 1 in 3 — are prediabetic,2,3 and most are unaware of this fact.KetoFast: Rejuvenate Y...Dr. Joseph MercolaBest Price: $12.87Buy New $11.99(as of 10:55 EDT - Details)However, any fasting blood sugar regularly over 90 in my book suggests insulin resistance, and findings by the late Dr. Joseph Kraft — former chairman of the department of clinical pathology and nuclear medicine at Presence Saint Joseph's Hospital, Chicago, and author of ""Diabetes Epidemic and You: Should Everyone Be Tested?"" — suggests a whopping 80% of Americans are insulin resistant, and that's true even if your fasting glucose is normal.4,5The good news is that insulin resistance is one of the easiest health problems to correct. Below I review eight of my top tips for optimizing and maintaining a healthy blood sugar level.Tip No. 1 — Proper Meal TimingIntermittent fasting or compression of your eating window is a powerful approach that facilitates weight loss and helps reduce your risk of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes.In his book ""Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy and Sleep Well Every Night,"" Satchidananda Panda, Ph.D., cites research showing that 90 percent of people eat across a span of 12 hours a day, and many across even longer timespans, which is a clear prescription for metabolic disaster.Intermittent fasting, i.e., the cycling of feast (feeding) and famine (fasting) mimics the eating habits of our ancestors and restores your body to a more natural state that allows a whole host of metabolic benefits to occur.6With regard to insulin resistance, research shows intermittent fasting promotes insulin sensitivity and improves blood sugar management by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates.7While there are a number of different intermittent fasting protocols, my preference is fasting daily for 18 hours and eating all meals within a six-hour window. If you're new to the concept of intermittent fasting, consider starting by skipping breakfast and have your lunch and dinner within a six-hour timeframe, say 11 AM and 5 PM, making sure you stop eating three hours before going to bed.The latter is important, as it helps protect your mitochondrial function. Recent research8,9 shows men who are at risk of Type 2 diabetes can improve their glucose control, thereby lowering that risk, simply by eating all their meals within a nine-hour timeframe — even if they do not implement any other dietary changes.Research10,11 has also shown men who eat supper at least two hours before bedtime have a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer, and women have a 16% lower risk of breast cancer than those who eat dinner closer to bedtime. For more details on why late-night eating is so detrimental, see ""Eating Early Dinner Aids Weight Loss and Lowers Cancer Risk.""When you do eat, focus on healthy protein in moderate amounts and minimize net carbs like pasta and bread, exchanging them for healthy fats like butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and raw nuts. This will help shift you into fat burning mode.On a related side note, when eating, relax and take your time! Research shows rushed eating, which typically occurs when you're stressed, has a significant impact on your blood sugar level. When you become stressed your body also secretes cortisol and glucagon, both of which affect your blood sugar levels as well.12 You can learn more about this in ""How Stress Can Affect Your Blood Sugar Level.""Tip No. 2 — Monitor Your Blood Sugar LevelAs mentioned, while prediabetes13 is clinically defined as having a fasting blood sugar level between 100 and 125 mg/dl, I strongly believe any blood sugar over 90 mg/dl puts you in the danger zone for insulin resistance. Your blood sugar is measured through a glucose test, of which there are four types:Fasting plasma glucose test — When you fast overnight and take your blood sample in the morningOral glucose tolerance test — Similar to the fasting blood sugar test, overnight fasting is required for this, and the person's fasting blood sugar level is measured. Afterward, a sugary liquid is provided and the levels are then tested for the next two hoursHemoglobin A1C test — This test checks the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin and will indicate your average blood sugar level for the past two to three monthsRandom plasma glucose test — This makes use of a blood sample that is taken at a random timeYou could also do 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring, which I've done in the past, although it's pricey and probably not necessary for most people.At the time, I used a Dexcom monitor, which involves inserting a sensor beneath your skin for a week, which takes continuous glucose readings every few minutes. It really helped me fine-tune and evaluate how different foods impacted my glucose levels, and helped me understand the importance of feast-famine cycling.All of that said, for most people, a simple at-home glucose test,14 where you prick your finger and deposit a drop of blood onto a glucose testing strip, will do the job. Ideally, test yourself two to three times a day: first thing in the morning, before your first meal, and a couple of hours after your last meal.Your blood glucose levels will vary throughout the day. According to conventional recommendations, if you are healthy and do not have diabetes, your fasting blood glucose upon waking should be below 100 mg/dL. I recommend aiming for a fasting (when you wake up) level below 90 mg/dL.Before meal time, your glucose level should read between 70 to 99 mg/dL. After meals — or what's called ""postprandial"" and is usually taken two hours after eating — the level should be below 140 mg/dL.There are two measurements used for blood sugar levels. In the U.S., the measurement is in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). In the U.K. and Canada, the measurement for blood sugar is in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). To convert to mg/dL, multiply the amount by 18. For example, if a person in the U.K. says that their blood glucose result is 7 mmol/L, in the U.S. it's read as 126 mg/dL.Tip No. 3 — Monitor Your Blood KetonesAnother valuable test is the blood ketone test, which will tell you whether you're in nutritional ketosis or not. I recommend starting your intermittent fasting routine and monitoring your blood ketones as you go along. The KetoCoachX monitor15 is currently one of the best and least expensive ketone monitors on the market.You're in nutritional ketosis once your blood ketone level is above 0.3 to 0.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).16 Ideally, perform the test first thing in the morning while still in a fasted state (i.e., before ingesting anything). Having a fasting ketone level above 1 mmol/L is a sign you're in deep ketosis.Once your fasting ketones are greater than 0.3 mmol/L, then you can start incorporating partial fasting as described in my book, ""KetoFast: Rejuvenate Your Health With a Step-by-Step Guide to Timing Your Ketogenic Meals.""The partial fasting regimen described in ""KetoFast"" essentially mimics ancestral eating patterns, allowing your body to work optimally by allowing for periods of breakdown and cleanout, and periods of rebuilding and rejuvenation.Among the many health benefits of cyclical fasting is improved circulating glucose and lipid levels.17For a summary of my KetoFast protocol, see ""Avoid the Dark Side of Fasting and Ketosis With KetoFasting.""Tip No. 4 — Radically Limit Net Carbs Until You Are Metabolically FlexibleAlong with intermittent fasting, you'll also want to adopt a cyclical ketogenic diet, which involves radically limiting carbs (replacing them with healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein) until you're close to or at your ideal weight. As with intermittent fasting, this will allow your body to start using fat as its primary fuel rather than carbohydrates.Twenty grams of carbs a day is on the low end of what's typically recommended to maintain nutritional ketosis, although some may be able to eat up to 50 grams a day and still maintain a ketogenic state.The only way you'll know how many total carbs, fiber and net carbs you eat is to keep a food diary. The simplest way of doing this is to use an online nutrition tracker. Also remember you need to measure your ketones to determine if and when you're in nutritional ketosis.One of the primary reasons you develop insulin resistance is because you're eating too many net carbs (total carbs minus fiber), too much protein and too little healthy fat. For optimal health, your body must be able to burn fat for fuel, and this is an ability that is lost when you consume too many net carbs on a daily basis.When your body is able to burn fat for fuel, your liver creates ketones (water-soluble fats) that not only improve your glucose metabolism18 but also burn far more efficiently than carbs, thus lowering inflammation by creating fewer damaging reactive oxygen species and secondary free radicals.If your ketones are above 0.3 mmol/L, as described in the section above, you can start increasing the amount of healthy carbs back into your diet and start cyclical ketosis.To get you started, see my previous article, ""Ketogenic Diet: A Beginner's Ultimate Guide to Keto."" A far more detailed exposition on nutritional ketosis and how to implement a cyclical ketogenic diet can be found in my book, ""Fat for Fuel,"" which is the prequel to ""KetoFast.""Tip No. 5 — Increase Healthy FatsA key to making nutritional ketosis work is to replace the lost carbs with healthy fats, and knowing which fats are healthy and which ones are not is a crucial distinction here. Most people will need 60 to 85 percent of daily calories in the form of fat, but not all fats qualify.Fats to steer clear of are industrially processed vegetable oils, found in most processed foods and restaurant foods. Polyunsaturated fat found in processed vegetable oils is not harmful in and of itself, but becomes so if and when you eat too much of it, and/or when the oils degrade, which occurs during refining, processing and heating (cooking).Not only can they form trans fats if heated high enough, but they can also form cyclic aldehydes, which are even more harmful. For a run-down of the dangers associated with processed vegetable oils, see ""Top 13 Reasons to Replace Dangerous Oils With Healthy Fats.""For cooking, healthy alternatives include coconut oil, grass fed raw organic butter, organic ghee, lard, tallow and olive oil. For general eating, foods high in healthy fats include avocado, olives, coconut, raw nuts such as macadamia and pecans, seeds such as black sesame, cumin, pumpkin and hemp seeds, raw cacao butter and organic pastured egg yolks.Dairy fats found in butter, cheese and yogurt have been shown to lower your diabetes risk specifically. MCT oil is another healthy fat — just be sure to avoid taking it during partial fasting days once you've started KetoFasting, as exogenous ketones will inhibit autophagy.Tip No. 6 — Drink Plenty of Clean Pure WaterNext, be sure to drink plenty of clean, purified water. Organic black coffee (meaning no milk or sugar) and tea are other healthy choices. Steer clear of all sweetened beverages, including ""diet"" drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners and fruit juices.As for how much water you need, your best bet is to use thirst and the color of your urine as a guide, along with frequency of urination.Thirst — Simply using thirst as a guide to how much water you need to drink is a simple way to help ensure your individual needs are met, day by dayColor — If your urine is a deep, dark yellow, then you are likely not drinking enough water. Light straw-colored urine is typically a sign of sufficient water intakeFrequency of urination — If your urine is scant or if you haven't urinated in many hours, that too is an indication that you're not drinking enough. Based on the results from a few different studies, a healthy person urinates on average about seven or eight times a dayTip No. 7 — Eat More Nuts and SeedsIn addition to being a good source of healthy fats, nuts and seeds are also an excellent source of magnesium, which many are deficient in. Lack of magnesium may raise your risk of insulin resistance as it plays an important role in carbohydrate and glucose metabolism. Magnesium helps your body metabolize carbs and glucose properly. As noted by Today's Dietician:19""Epidemiologic data20,21 suggest that for every 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreases by approximately 15%. The few clinical studies22,23 showing efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity with magnesium supplementation have used doses between 300 and 365 mg/day.""Some of the most magnesium-rich seeds include sunflower, black sesame, black cumin, pumpkin and chia seeds. Among these, black cumin (nigella sativa) deserves special mention, as studies have shown it can help prevent both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.In one study, black cumin improved glucose tolerance as efficiently as metformin.24 As a source of healthy fats, my preferences go to macadamias, pecans and walnuts, as they are high in fat while being lower in protein.Tip No. 8 — Properly Prescribed ExerciseLast but not least, you need exercise, focusing more on strength/resistance training than cardio. Research25 published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise found even a single session of moderate exercise can improve the way your body regulates glucose and reduces postprandial glucose spikes, and several studies have demonstrated the benefits of strength training for diabetes specifically.Among them is a 2017 study,26 which found strength training lowered women's risk of Type 2 diabetes by 30%. Adding aerobic exercise on top of it reduced the risk even further. Participants who performed at least 120 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, along with some form of strength training, had a 65% lower risk for Type 2 diabetes than those who did neither.Research27 published in April 2019 found a link between muscular strength and Type 2 diabetes incidence. People with mid-level muscular strength, measured using leg and bench press tests, had a 32% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to weaker cohorts, irrespective of cardiorespiratory fitness. No significant association between diabetes and upper level muscle strength was observed, however.A third example of this kind of research was published in BioMed Research International in 2013.28This review also investigated the mechanisms of how exercise lowers your risk of diabetes. One way by which strength training improves your glucose metabolism is by increasing glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle.GLUT4 translocation occurs as a result of muscle contraction,29 and is required for proper regulation of glucose uptake in your muscles. Strength training increases your insulin sensitivity, as lean muscle is highly sensitive to insulin,30 which helps restore metabolic flexibility.Fat for Fuel: A Revolu...Dr. Joseph MercolaBest Price: $9.75Buy New $12.15(as of 06:35 EDT - Details)By using insulin more efficiently, your body also ends up using more glucose, leaving less to circulate in your bloodstream — hence the improvements in glucose control.31,32 ""Increased energy expenditure and excess postexercise oxygen consumption in response to resistance training may be other beneficial effects,"" the review paper33 notes.High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has also been shown to effectively reduce your risk for diabetes. In one such study,34 older overweight Type 2 diabetics improved their glucose regulation in just six HIIT sessions done over the course of two weeks.Participants performed 10 bouts of 60-second cycling at 90 percent of their maximum heart rate, interspersed with 60 seconds of rest (total time spent exercising was one hour per week). Overall, the average 24-hour blood glucose concentration was reduced from 7.6 mmol/L (± 1.0) to 6.6 mmol/L (± 0.7) following the exercise.According to the authors, ""Our findings indicate that low-volume HIIT can rapidly improve glucose control and induce adaptations in skeletal muscle that are linked to improved metabolic health in patients with Type 2 diabetes.""Sources and References The Best of Joseph Mercola",https://t.co/aRlEbjiZye,news

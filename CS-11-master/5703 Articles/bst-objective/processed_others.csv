Zenith Labs Blood Sugar Premier Review - Controlling Blood Sugar?,"Keeping our blood sugar levels in check is quite a challenging task. We not only have to watch what we eat, but also exercise regularly and stay away from sedentary habits. At the same time, we have to juggle a busy work schedule along with the stresses of modern life. Stress and unhealthy food are the two main culprits in knocking our blood sugar out of whack. However, it is these two aspects that are unavoidable in this day and age. Fortunately, though, science has given us a third-party support which may help us to control our blood sugar and possibly prevent disturbing conditions like diabetes. We're talking here about Zenith Labs' Blood Sugar Premier, the reputed company's offering for assisting with blood sugar issues.Read on to find out everything you need to know about the Blood Sugar Premier, its features, benefits, and usage.About the Blood Sugar PremierThe formula of the Blood Sugar Premier is based on a new discovery about Chinese medicine. This is known as the 'Old Testament"" of such practices. When used regularly, the Blood Sugar Premier could help people with blood sugar issues to handle their problems in a natural manner.The Blood Sugar Premier supplement is meant for supporting a balanced sugar level within our blood and also promoting healthy levels of insulin. We all know that when insulin gets out of control, all sort of problems like insulin resistance, diabetes, and PCOS come into play. Since none of us wants these health issues to be a part of our lives, we should consider taking the Blood Sugar Premier in order to help us control our internal systems.How the Blood Sugar Premier WorksThe Blood Sugar Premier works through a special and unique formula. As mentioned above, it's based on the ancient tradition of Chinese medicine. This is a practice that many people are looking towards as a way to avoid taking synthetic and possibly addictive conventional medicine. The Blood Sugar Premier hence takes its efficacy from ancient herbs such as piperine, curcumin, and berberine. When combined, these three ingredients give a potent and lasting trigger for supporting proper levels of blood sugar in our bodies. In addition to this, there are several other vitamins and herbs added that contribute to the powerful effect of the Blood Sugar Premier.Advantages of the Blood Sugar PremierThere are several reasons why we should start taking the Blood Sugar Premier, if only to try it out once. Some of these are mentioned below:– The support of balanced blood sugar could prevent us from contracting diabetes and its many negative symptoms. These include sugar crashes, weakness, joint pain, and even more dangerous effects. However, it must be kept in mind that the Blood Sugar Premier is not a substitute for diabetes medicine and should be taken after consulting our regular doctor.– The supplement promotes healthy levels of insulin. This would reduce insulin resistance, which is a symptom of PCOS and diabetes as well. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility among women, so the Blood Sugar Premier is providing a much needed service if it controls insulin resistance.– Taking the Blood Sugar Premier can help us lose weight and body fat as well. This is because mismanaged blood sugar levels and insulin resistance both contribute to weight gain and a resistance to weight loss. When these negative factors are dealt with, the body would soon start responding to a proper diet and exercise in the normal fashion.– Regular intake of the Blood Sugar Premier can help in enhancing overall mood and increasing energy levels. This would be a great boost, since sugar crashes and the effect of low blood sugar could make one feel weak and lethargic. Taking this supplement would hence enable us to get things done on time and enjoy our lives more. – The capsules of the Blood Sugar Premier are easy to take no matter where we are. All we have to do is take two capsules twice a day with water. We can even slip the bottle into our purse or pocket and take them to work or on a trip. The capsules can easily go into pill boxes with no fear of spoilage or leakage, as is the case with liquid or powder supplements.Ingredients of the Blood Sugar PremierIf we're going to place our trust in the Blood Sugar Premier we need to know about its three key ingredients. Fortunately, the official website for this supplement doesn't hold back on giving us information about them. It's hence worth looking at the following elements and briefly discussing these:– BerberineBerberine is mainly used for dealing with inflammation of the body cells. When taken regularly and in the right amounts, it can even break down the fatty deposits surrounding the pancreas. This would help the body to reset its blood sugar management system and proceed normally. Berberine is an extract derived from the Chinese Goldthread Plant, but there's no need to go out in search of it now. Zenith Labs has provided us with a convenient and modern formulation that's both easy and convenient to take.– CurcuminCurcumin is derived from nature turmeric root, which has many healing benefits in both Indian and Chinese herbal medicine. It's also helpful for dealing with harmful inflammation in the body, which is what usually causes blood sugar levels to go awry.– PiperineTurmeric needs something to help it absorb into the body and actually work its magic. otherwise, it would simply pass through without giving much benefit. For this purpose, Zenith Labs has added piperine into the mix of Blood Sugar Premier. Piperine is a black pepper molecule that can activate the curcumin when it's taken into the body. This has been tested and found to be beneficial for healthy insulin levels and the promotion of non-inflamed cells.How to Take the Blood Sugar PremierWe should take one capsule of the Blood Sugar Premier in the morning with our breakfast, and one in the evening with dinner. If our physician recommends a higher dose, as can be possible with overweight or extreme cases, the dose can be increased to four capsules a day.Buying the Blood Sugar PremierFortunately, the Blood Sugar Premier is available to us in three convenient packages. We can start off by trying just one bottle, which gives us a whole month's supply. Alternatively, we may get three bottles or six in one go. An individual bottle would cost much more when bought separately, though. Since buying the bottle in bulk is cheaper, we might get our friends in on the deal or stock up on the supplement once we've determined that it's right for us. We may save over $30 in this manner. Conclusion – Is Blood Sugar Premier Worth Trying?Blood sugar levels are no joke, so we should take all the help we can get in order to control them. While we should get a doctor's approval first, the Blood Sugar Premier certainly seems like a viable option. It's made up of natural ingredients with well-researched formulation. We don't know how long the supplies would last, though, so it's best if we visit the official website and place an order soon.

Retinal Support - Sugar Balance Support,"Sugar Balance: Circulatory and Retinal SupportAbout diabetic retinopathy Diet &amp; nutrition Lifestyle ReviewsDamage occurs to the retina when blood vessels in the eye become enlarged and leak putting pressure on other parts of the retina. In some casesnew capillaries grow abnormally crowding the retina structure and distorting and damaging vision.The National Institutes of Health attributes blood sugar imbalances as contributing factors not only to diabetic retinopathy,but to cataracts and glaucoma.Complementary TreatmentSince we consider most eye conditions to be a reflection of the health of the whole body, lifestyle choices and diet can play a major factor in cultivating and maintaining good vision. Below are some recommendations:Vision loss resulting from blood sugar imbalance may be largely preventable with diligent care by you and from your physician. Certain nutrients such as vandyl sulfate, gymnema sylvestra, chromium, zeaxanthin, lutein, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C and other vitamins, enzymes and omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful. Diet &amp; NutritionJuice fresh, organic drinks daily. We recommend ginger, garlic, asparagus, leeks, jerusalem artichokes, parsley, spinach, beets, celery, pumpkin, carrots, cabbage, raspberries, chlorophyll, (not too much fruit).Learn more about whyjuicing is important and effective.Drink plenty of purified water daily.Eat cold water fish (including salmon, mackerel, sardines) 2-3 times a week.Include more fiber in your diet, and nibble rather than gobble.Take digestive aids (in a natural form) if needed to improve digestion.Certain nutrients including antioxidants, amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, and fish oil may help those with diabetic retinopathy and may help to preserve vision.Researchers report that patients with diabetic eye disease have lower levels of folic acid and red cell folate levels, and that the greater the deficiencythe greater the severity.1Researchers find that curcumin, found in turmeric, is a neuroprotective role in treating diabetes.2, 4Vitamin D deficiency is associated with risk and severity of diabetic eye disease.3Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant compound improves insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 diabetes.6,7,8Astaxanthin has protective actions of microalgae against endogenous and exogenous advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in human retinal pigment epithelial cells.9,10Bilberry may lessen neovascularization in the retina, which complicates retinopathy. Bilberry is also used to improve night vision and to decrease vascular permeability and capillary fragility; most interest has been focused on its anthocyanin-related antioxidant effects.11,12 CoQ10 has strong antioxidant properties and protects proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.13DHA, a component of omega-3s, reduces inflammation such as the inflammation in the retina seen in diabetic retinopathy. DHA is also a precursor for a biochemical compound known as neuroprotectin D1, which also helps protect against damage from inflammation and reduces cell death within the retina.14,15Glutathione is one of the super antioxidants that neutralizes the full range of free radicals. Patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes are unable to adequately synthesize glutathione because of a lack of natural precursors in the body.16,17Grape seed extract stimulates the body's Nrf2 pathway (activating the antioxidant defenses of the body)25 and upregulates thioredoxin (a protein that acts as an antioxidant and is important for cell-to-cell communication).26Lutein/zeaxanthin/lycopene all address inflammation, a problem in diabetic eye disease. Such patients tend to have low levels of these carotenoids compared to diabetics who do not have eye disease.18, 19Taurine has been reported to protect visual function during diabetes and to help prevent damage due to oxidative stress and inflammation.20,21 Trans-resveratrol helps protect nerve cells from damage, promotes healthy insulin sensitivity, encourages enhanced mitochondrial function, promotes a healthy inflammatory response, and protects against the effects of a high-fat diet.22,23,24LifestyleAvoid cortisone. This drug raises blood sugar.Limit medications you don't really need, working closely with your doctor.Exercise is very important for you. A brisk daily or 4-5 days a week walk can be helpful in maintaining overall health. Research demonstrates thatthose who do not get much exercise have a more difficult time managing their sugar balance.Manage weight by maintaining a healthy balanced diet. See dietary recommendations for detailed information.Yoga. Research suggests that 12 minutes of yoga6 every daybrings about a measurable reductions in inflammation - an issue in diabetic retinopathy.Be sure to work closely with your doctor. Don't change insulin or diabetes-related medications without consulting your doctor.European researchers have found that optogenetics, in which light-sensing proteins areintroduced into the eye, may be helpful in treating retinal degenerative conditions like diabetic retinopathy.Conventional TreatmentThere are two surgical treatments for diabetic retinopathy:Laser Surgery. Argon-laser photocoagulation is a type of laser surgery used to treat macular edema and proliferative retinopathy (advanced diabetic retinopathy). Generally, laser surgery is used to stabilize vision, not necessarily to improve it.27 Laser surgery includes focal and scatter laser treatment. Focal laser treatment seals leaking vessels.28 Scatter laser treatment (used for proliferative retinopathy) shrinks the abnormal blood vessels. Both of these treatments can often result in loss of peripheral vision. Vitrectomy is the surgical removal of the vitreous gel in the center of the eye. In some people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, bleeding into the vitreous (vitreous hemorrhage) makes laser photocoagulation treatment impossible because the blood obscures the surgeon's view of the retina. Vitrectomy, which is performed under local or general anesthesia, typically on an outpatient basis, removes the cloudy vitreous and replaces it with a salt solution, or air (which is a mixture of gases—mainly nitrogen and oxygen), but also small amounts of carbon dioxide and substantially lower amounts of many other inert gases such as argon, neon, and helium. Eye drops are used for a few weeks after the surgery. This solution has a low surface tension and therefore does not have a negative effect on the retina. The surgery typically includes steroid drops to minimize inflammation, antibiotic drops to prevent infection, and dilating drops to provide comfort and minimize scarring of the pupil. The gases from air are reabsorbed by the body in a week to two months and are replaced by natural vitreous fluid that the eye is constantly producing. Silicone oil is also sometimes used and may result in a quicker visual recovery after surgery, no restriction on air travel, no special head positioning after surgery, and longer duration of effect. But it needs to be removed later in a procedure similar to vitreous humor removal.Side effects of vitrectomyShort-term sensitivity to glare and/or double vision. 5-10% risk of needing further retinal surgery30-43% likelihood of developing a cataract Elevated pressure inside the eye especially in people who have glaucomaFurther bleeding into the vitreous gelRetinal detachmentFluid buildup in the clear covering of the eye (corneal edema)Infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis) Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) injections include drugs such as Lucentis, Avestin, Regeneron, and/or Eylea. They are administered via injection for retinal bleeding or edema, and help to shrink new blood vessels. Treatment using these injections can last up to five years, with a gradual decrease of injections over time. Recovery time depends on the extent of the diabetic retinopathy. Depending on the extent of the blood leakage, it may take weeks or up to months for the blurriness to improve; full vision does not always return. As a side note, dilated eye exams may be needed less often as the disease stabilizes. However, it is important to note, that if the underlying mechanism is not addressed, these treatments are a temporary solution. The signals (VEGF) in the body to create new blood vessels are still present, so eventually more new blood vessels will develop.Intravitreal corticosteroids have been successfully used in the eyes of patients with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME), similar to diabetic retinopathy.29 The epidemiology of DME is not well studied and the diagnosis is challenging since proper diagnosis and classification is not possible with non-stereoscopic retinal photos.Footnotes1.

Blood Sugar Ultra Review - Controlling Sugar Levels Without Side Effects?,"High or fluctuating blood sugar can be quite dangerous for a human being, not to mention the diseases that they bring on as well. Imbalance in blood sugar levels leads to diabetes, PCOS, and several other health problems that might not go away for a lifetime. If we have problematic blood sugar levels, now is the time to start controlling them. If we don't we might face shorter life spans, a lowered quality of life, and several difficulties in other aspects as well. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are the two most common results of blood sugar issues. Naturally, these conditions don't make us look good or feel good about ourselves. As a result, depressive and anxiety disorders can also rise up to make our lives even more difficult. Science and research have not been stagnant on this issue, and we do have a plethora of methods for controlling blood sugar levels. While many people do try out the conventional medical route, there might be a safer, more effective path found in the Blood Sugar Ultra. With this, we might be able to find our problem dealt with from within instead of just handling the symptoms. Let's discuss this further below.About the Blood Sugar UltraThe Blood Sugar Ultra is mainly a dietary supplement that's formulated with ingredients designed to relieve the matter of rising blood sugar. The name itself will tell us that it just might be an excellent manner of reducing these levels in a safe, natural, yet potent manner. Many doctors might prescribe pills, injections, and extremely strict diets in order to bring the situation under control, but these might not always be possible. The pills and injections might have serious side effects, and cause issues with our body organs as well. Since the Blood Sugar Ultra is comprised of naturally sourced ingredients, we can be somewhat reassured that the side effects wouldn't be anything but beneficial.How the Blood Sugar Ultra WorksIn order to understand how the Blood Sugar Ultra supplement works, we must also understand why we contract Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and the other health problems related to blood sugar levels. This happens because our pancreas is not functioning properly, producing less insulin than we need to process everything we eat. As a result, all that sugar and glucose that we consume raise our blood sugar levels and can also cause fat deposits within our body. Since many diabetics require insulin injections, it's clear that we need to take steps for enhancing insulin production within our body. The ingredients in the Blood Sugar Ultra are geared towards doing just that. While the injections might work for some time, a natural method is obviously better in effect and durability. The ingredients are then the major reason for the Blood Sugar Ultra working so well for many users. Through the regular use of this supplement, many have found relief from the symptoms as well as an overall better state of physical health. With the proper diet and medical consultation, we might even be looking at a way to get rid of diabetes as much as possible.What to Expect from the Blood Sugar UltraThe Blood Sugar Ultra might not work right away, or even within a short period of time. It might take a few weeks, or even a month for the benefits to show up. When they do, however, we may expect a chance to live life to its full potential. This is by getting our energy and vitality back through controlled blood sugar levels. Plus, the Blood Sugar Ultra helps us achieve the benefits we need in an organic, natural manner. This assures us that we're moving towards a more normal life in the healthiest way possible. Those who have qualms about taking synthetic fillers, chemicals, and conventional medicine, in general, will also be delighted by this offering. Ingredients of the Blood Sugar UltraAs we've mentioned above, the Blood Sugar Ultra functions due to the nature and formulation of the ingredients inside those capsules. It's heartening to see that the ingredient information is released to the masses. This way, we can research all the components and confirm whether they really are good for controlling blood sugar levels.There's just one main ingredient, which is an extract from the Morus Indica plant. Laymen would know of this as the mulberry plant. The derivation of this ingredient is done through silkworms, who primarily feed upon mulberry leaves. We should check with our primary medical practitioner to make sure we're not allergic to mulberry in any form. If all's clear, the Blood Sugar Ultra just might be the supplement to control our blood sugar. Mulberry leaf extract is instrumental in improving three main functions of our internal systems. These are the blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and heart function. By taking a regular dose of this extract, we can look forward to an overall improved blood lipid profile. We can also do the research on mulberry leaves and find out just how beneficial it is for the proper level of insulin production. As long as we also watch our diets and include some exercise into our lifestyle, this ingredient could freely work wonders within our system.Side EffectsWe can also decide whether or not to take this supplement by working out whether we stand the risk of allergies from these ingredients. Hence, it's wise to check the full ingredient list and also keep in mind the details for the main ones, which are mulberry leaf and Morus Indica.Bonus MaterialsUpon purchasing the Blood Sugar Ultra, the users will be able to receive two bonus reports for absolutely free of cost. A brief description about each of these reports is given below:– The Lean Liver Jumpstart – This guide is equipped with delicious recipes that are not only easy to make but are also very nutritious.

Amazon Alexa Launches its First HIPAA-Compliant Medical Skills,"The multitrillion-dollar health care industry is one hell of a market, especially with well over 70 million baby boomers hitting an age when health care is a necessity, not to mention 80 million millennials who are finally getting around to having kids. So, it makes sense that Amazon, which has been investing heavily in experimental health care projects and trials of its signature smart speaker in hospitals, would start creating HIPAA-compliant medical skills for its voice assistant, Alexa.HIPAA stands for the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which has two main purposes: First, to provide continuous health insurance coverage for workers who lose or change their jobs and, more importantly to Amazon, to standardize the electronic transmission of administrative and financial transactions.Amazon ran a trial of smart speakers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the last year, acquired online pharmacy PillPack for millions of dollars, and commanded its flagship division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to expand its HIPAA-compliant abilities.There are some hurdles for companies to jump through to get on Alexa's health care platform, but a bunch of big companies have a huge start. Amazon launched a site that enables companies to describe the health care skills they have in mind, giving Amazon a platform by which to vet the developers who want to apply to the program.The program has launched with six new Alexa health care skills from major providers, payors, pharmacy benefit managers, and digital health coaching companies. The biggest is probably Cigna Health, whose users can command Alexa to ask Cigna Health Today for a daily tip.""With our industry-leading voice skills, we are meeting customers where they are — in their homes, in their cars — and making it simpler to create healthier habits and daily routines. Through our Amazon Alexa skill, customers can simply use voice to understand the full range of their health benefits and receive personalized wellness incentives for meeting their health goals, empowering them to take control of their total health,"" said Stephen Cassell, senior vice president of Global Brand and Customer Communications for Cigna in Amazon's release.Other commands include the ability to ask Express Scripts where your order is, schedule an urgent care appointment with Swedish Health, book an appointment in the Carolinas with Atrium Health, or check blood sugar results with Livongo.",https://t.co/G7DdjpoXdY,others
"Aloe Vera helps control BS, A1C Levels & Limit Diabetes Complication","Aloe Vera gel has packed with magic ingredients of numerous medicinal properties; it appears to help reduce blood-glucose &amp; glycosylated hemoglobin levels.Aloe VeraAloe Vera plant: Aloe Vera is a stemless or very short-stemmed succulent (having thick, fleshy, water stored leaves) plant growing to 60 to 100 cm (i.e. 24 to 39 inches) tall. The leaves are thick and fleshy, green, or grey-green; margin of the leaf is serrated (saw-toothed) and has small white teeth.Aloe Vera nativity is unclear and may be from Africa; the modern gardeners have widely grown Aloe Vera as an ornamental plant.What is Aloe Vera Juice?Aloe Vera juice is from the leaves of the aloe plant by just removing the marginal saw-toothed spikes and the green layer of the leaf. Inside this, you can find a watery gel with yellow sap wash it out. Because consuming this sap may cause dysentery, but it can help treat constipation.Crash this clean Aloe Vera's jelly to become watery liquid called Aloe Vera juice. It is always best to take it as a fresh juice, but even commercially available Aloe Vera juices are effective. Consuming this Aloe Vera juice can help various health conditions, for details looks at the Aloe Vera benefits.VIDEOAloe Vera help lower blood sugar levelCo-administration of conventional drug and herbal medicine may cause potential interactions that lead to adverse events. So get doctor's consent before starting herbal treatment.The mechanism of action of Aloe Vera to reduce blood-glucose levels is by enhancing glucose metabolism.Additionally, the glucose-lowering effect could be by an antioxidant mechanism; it attenuates oxidative damage in the brains of streptozotocin (a naturally-occurring chemical that is particularly toxic to the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas) induced mice and reduced peroxidation levels in the kidneys of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Aloe Vera scientific evidence in blood sugar managementBlood sugar and triglyceride levels in the treated group fell. The results suggest the potential of aloe vera juice for use as an antidiabetic agent.

Nutrients 2016, 8(7), 388.Unlike conventional drugs, herbal medicines are complex mixtures of bioactive compounds. Season, growing condition, processing method can vary the constitutions of the bioactive compound.14 Medicinal Uses of Aloe VeraAloe Vera possesses anti-diabetic, anti-dyslipidemia, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant property, which may help prevent heart disease and strokes. Numerous studies show Aloe has a beneficial effect in the prevention of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.Aloe vera can nourish the body with minerals, vitamins, enzymes, and glycol-nutrients. Thus, Aloe vera beneficial from the head to toe.Control blood sugar - taking two tablespoons of aloe vera juice per day can lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Many types of research show the aloe gel contains active constitutions that reduce blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels (A1C).Lowers cholesterol level, oxygenate the blood, protect the body from stress, and reduce high blood pressure.Improves digestion – It is useful for indigestion, liver problems, stomach ulcers, intestinal worms, and many other conditions. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a digestive disorder result in heartburn. Consuming 1 to 3 ounces of aloe gel at mealtime could reduce the heartburn severity.Useful for constipation – Aloe vera is a natural laxative; 0.04 to 0.17 grams of dried juice is sufficient to relieve constipation.Skincare - Aloe vera gel is widely known to relieve sunburn and help heal wounds. It helps many skin conditions; use internally or externally such as for wounds, burns, rashes, sores, herpes, fungus, vaginal infections, acne, sunburn, psoriasis, warts, etc. It protects the skin from the aging effects of sunlight.Immune booster – Internally taking it increases immunity, thus helps cancer patients by stimulating the development of non-cancerous cells and white blood cells. Fight breast cancer - it has the potential in slowing the growth of breast cancer.Reduce Inflammation - It can help to slow down or inhibit inflammation.Fight infection – useful for urinary tract infections and kidney infections.Healthy joints - This may help painful joints due to stiffness and improve joint flexibility.Reduces dental plaque - Aloe vera in tooth gels is effective in fighting cavities.Treat mouth ulcers - Aloe vera can accelerate the healing of mouth ulcers.Improves mood - Aloe Vera reduced depression and improve memory.Adaptogen - is something that boosts the body's natural ability to adapt to external changes and resist illness.

It contains over 75 different ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, enzymes, sugars, anthraquinones or phenolic compounds, lignin, saponins, sterols, amino acids, and salicylic acid.Vitamins and Minerals are C, A, E, B vitamins, B-carotene, Zinc, Calcium, Copper, Magnesium, Manganese, and Phosphorous.It contains at least five different enzymes and likely more. It contains twenty-two amino acids. Plant sterol is a plant-based compound, potent anti-inflammatory agents.Gibberellin is a growth factor, which assists in healing. Polysaccharides, including B1-3 and B1-4 Glucomannan known for their immune stimulating effects, Based on its constituent make up; aloe has a wide array of applications.Possible side effects of Aloe VeraOther than occasional allergic reactions, there is no serious problem in the use of aloe gel, both internally and externally.If aloe is useful in your diabetes treatment, you should closely monitor your glucose levels.If possible, you can lower your medication in steps. Otherwise, hypoglycemia may occur.The laxative effect (yellow sap from aloe vera) of aloe may cause abdominal cramps, pain, and severe diarrhea, with subsequent fluid and electrolyte disturbances.This form may deplete potassium, predisposing people who use it to cardiac abnormalities. However, after removing the aloe vera skin there is yellow sap appears, if you properly remove these sap in running water, then these laxative effect disappears and provide abdominal benefit by calming down the digestive system. Additive hypokalemia may also occur when it is coadministered with other drugs that deplete potassium, such as diuretics or corticosteroids.",https://t.co/w0KR58gGA5,others
The Fat Burning Kitchen,"Attention Men &amp; Women Over Age 50 Struggling To Lose Weight... Discover How The Foods You're Eating Every Day Are Making Your Fat Cells SICK... Making it IMPOSSIBLE to lose weight, while also damaging your joints, disrupting your hormones, rapidly aging your skin, and even leading to Diabetes. Which means if you've been struggling to lose weight, whether it's months, days, or even years, then please pay close attention to the article below because you're going to discover it's NOT your fault... Sound insane? Please do yourself a favor and take 2-minutes out of your busy day to read this very important health article... by Mike Geary, aka 'The Nutrition Watchdog' Certified Nutrition Specialist, Best-Selling Author May 23, 2019 How did you feel when you woke up this morning? Were you refreshed and able to jump out of bed… …or did it take a while to force yourself up and out of bed, after being rudely shaken out of your slumber by that stupid alarm clock buzz, buzz, buzzing in your ear? Did your body feel ""young"" and energetic as you got up, or... ...Were you achy and groggy from another restless night's sleep? When you looked yourself in the mirror, did you see a fresh, young face, or… …Did you stagger into the bathroom, ankles and knees creaking, hunched over from back pain and tightness, and see an old version of yourself staring back through the mirror? With bags under your eyes, dry &amp; graying hair, wrinkled &amp; dry skin? When you looked down as you got dressed did you see a fit, lean, and healthy body, or… … Did you see an ever-growing stomach, soft, ""flabby"" fat, and a body that's become weak, tired and soft? What goes through your mind as you look at yourself? Are you happy with the way you look and feel, or… … Are you frustrated by your life, with your lack of health, and with your inability to lose weight and keep it off? Do you mumble to yourself, ""What the hell? How did I get to look and feel like this?"" Are you at ease and peaceful, or stressed as you get ready for your day? Do you have to drink multiple cups of coffee before you can even think about being productive and nice? Do you drink more throughout the day, or even worse, use energy drinks and soda, because you have wild energy swings where you go from feeling good and energetic… to crashing and feeling like you need a nap? Do you get winded easy? Lose your breath after you've gone up a flight of stairs, or as you rush out the door to your car? How's your digestion? Do you have comfortable bowel movements, or is your life all about digestive issues like constipation, bloating, bouts of diarrhea, and indigestion? How many times have you promised yourself you were going to lose weight, and maybe even did, but then put it all back on… and more? How many times in the last couple years have you started a ""diet"" or workout program? Once, twice, 10 times? How do your failures make you feel? If you and I were sitting face-to-face, and I asked you point blank, after all you just read, ""How do you feel?"" What would you say? Look, weight gain, and weight loss, are serious concerns of yours, and I get it… … but these other issues are also very serious: Joint pain, muscle weakness, digestive issues, ""old"" skin and hair, stubborn belly fat, zero energy, and an addiction to carbohydrates… … and they're ALL connected. You may be thinking this all sounds crazy, but let me ask you this... How many of the following are you currently struggling with? Stubborn belly fat that will NOT go away, regardless of the diets you try Painful or uncomfortable bloating (especially after eating meals) Fat gain in strange places (chest in men, belly in ladies, for example) Painful joints Digestive issues (IBS, gas, stomach discomfort, constipation and/or diarrhea) Dry, aging skin &amp; hair (looking older than you really are...) Energy swings (low energy before eating, high after... then crash) Constant craving of carbohydrates Trouble sleeping (can't fall asleep and/or stay asleep) Moody and irritable if you get too hungry Indigestion Your gut &amp; stubborn belly fat... There is growing evidence showing the connection between a ""leaky"" gut and issues such as weight gain, thyroid problems, Type-2 Diabetes, a lack of energy, digestion problems (constipation, bloating, gas, diarrhea, indigestion, etc.). Basically, your gut works like this… Your entire digestive system, from your mouth to your hind end, is one long tube that's actually outside your body… even though it's inside. This long tube has very strong barriers that keep toxic substances OUT of your body, and when these barriers are damaged, as in the case of leaky gut, then food particles and toxins that are not supposed to make it into your blood stream and lymph system, are there, which then makes organs like your liver have to work double time to get rid of this toxicity. This heavy workload then makes your liver get sluggish and bogged down (imagine yourself having to do the job of 10 people in half the time and how that would make you feel)… When your liver gets sluggish it makes it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to burn fat, because that's where your fat gets processed… … but it all starts in your gut. Your intestines have small hair-like features that line their walls that help shuttle food along, aid in digestion, and help shuttle nutrients from your digestive system into your bloodstream to be used by your body. Unfortunately the foods you eat, including many foods falsely labeled as ""healthy"", as well as too much stress, a lack of sleep, too much alcohol, a lack of Vitamin D, and more can damage this delicate system... ... Causing toxins to be ""leaked"" into your body, leading to weight gain, an inability to LOSE weight, achy joints, constipation, bloating, rapidly aging skin, zero energy, hormone problems, etc. What foods can lead to such a horrible situation? The biggest culprits are the ""health foods"" you eat every day, and have been told are the healthiest by big food corporations, your doctor, health teachers, and even the government. You often hear vague claims in the news that ""sugar is bad for you"" or that ""wheat and gluten are bad for you"", but do you truly understand what these foods do to your insides? Most people DON'T understand the reasons... ...and the fact is that some of the foods you're going to discover can not only DESTROY your digestive system, but also hormones and metabolism. Not only that, but as you'll see below, there's a common plant-based food that you probably eat in restaurants frequently (I bet you ate this at least ONCE in the last week), and this common plant food is proven to CAUSE heart attacks! You'll also discover exactly what you need to understand to eat in a way that BOOSTS your metabolism, balances hormones, FIGHTS stubborn belly fat, heals your gut, and increases your energy, regardless of your ""bad genetics"". So let's get right to it… The 3 reasons you should NEVER eat wheat -- Yes, even ""whole wheat"" There are 3 main reasons why wheat is a terrible food for your body and does more harm than good... Reason #1 -- Wheat causes blood sugar disruption, Glycation of your cells, increases AGING, weight gain &amp; boosts Diabetes risk Before I tell you why wheat can actually speed up the aging process in your body, let's clarify some simple biochemistry in your body... This deals with ""glycation"" in your body, and substances called Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs). These nasty little compounds called AGEs speed up the aging process in your body including damage over time to your organs, your joints, and of course, wrinkled skin. So with that said, what is one of the biggest factors that increase production of AGEs inside your body? This may surprise you, but high blood sugar levels over time dramatically increase age-accelerating AGEs in your body. This is why type 2 diabetics many times appear that they have not aged well and look older than their real age. But this age-increasing effect is NOT just limited to diabetics. So, let's get back to how ""whole wheat"" relates to this... Here is a little-known fact that's often covered up by the massive marketing campaigns by giant food companies that want you to believe that ""whole wheat"" is healthy for you... ... But the fact is that wheat contains a very unusual type of carbohydrate (not found in other foods) called Amylopectin-A, which has been found in some tests to spike your blood sugar HIGHER than even pure table sugar. In fact, amylopectin-A (from wheat) raises your blood sugar MORE than almost any other carbohydrate source on earth based on blood sugar response testing that's documented in studies. This means that wheat-based foods such as breads, bagels, cereals, muffins, and other baked goods often cause MUCH higher blood sugar levels than most other carbohydrate sources. If you don't believe me, here's something you should know... I ran personal blood sugar tests on myself using a blood glucometer about 45 minutes after eating 2 slices of wheat bread vs eating a bowl of oatmeal, with equivalent grams of carbohydrates. The blood sugar test results of wheat vs oatmeal: 2 slices of whole wheat toast: 45 minutes after consumption: Blood sugar spiked from 86 fasting level to 155 1 Bowl of Oatmeal (equivalent grams of carbs to 2 slices wheat toast) 45 minutes after consumption: Blood sugar increased from 86 fasting level to 112 As you know now, the higher your average blood sugar levels are over time, the more AGEs are formed inside your body, which makes you age FASTER. Clearly, the whole wheat spiked blood sugar MUCH higher than the oatmeal, and if you don't know, 155 is a massive blood sugar reading that will certainly contribute to faster aging if you eat wheat frequently... and most people eat wheat without even thinking about it at almost EVERY meal...Yikes! Not only that, but the high blood sugar spikes caused by wheat also makes your body pump out more insulin which makes you pack on more body fat... Not fun at all! These massive blood sugar spikes from eating wheat daily also cause damage over time to your blood sugar regulation system, harming your pancreas, causing insulin resistance, and eventually causing type 2 Diabetes. I think we have a strong case against eating so-called ""healthy"" wheat! Reason #2 -- Gluten and other gut-damaging compounds The topic of gluten is on fire in the media lately... ...But most people are confused as to whether there's any real health risks with gluten for the average person that doesn't have Celiac disease. The truth is that even if you are not officially ""gluten intolerant"" or ""gluten sensitive"", there are hundreds of published studies that indicate that gluten can cause inflammation in your digestive system, and even cause ""permeability"" in your gut, which can lead to a health condition that's on the rise lately called Leaky Gut, as well as other digestive issues and autoimmune problems. Scientists theorize that the reason gluten is causing these digestive system problems is due to the excessive hybridization of wheat over the last 50 years, which has created newly modified gluten molecules that are foreign to the human digestive system compared to the ancient wheat that humans ate for several thousand years historically, and even compared to the wheat that your grandparents ate 50+ years ago. Reason #3 -- Antinutrients and mineral blockers in wheat The third reason that wheat is terrible for you is that it contains what's called ""antinutrients"", which are naturally occurring compounds in the wheat plant, but can cause undesirable effects in humans that eat too much of them. One of these antinutrients is called phytates, which blocks the absorption in your body of certain minerals like zinc, iron, manganese, and calcium if you eat wheat too often. Again, most people eat wheat with almost every meal (cereal in the morning, bread on sandwich at lunch, and pasta or bread at dinner), so this can cause a mineral deficiency in your body over time that leads to many health conditions. Wheat has other mineral blockers and antinutrients aside from phytates, such as lectins. Lectins are another constituent of wheat that causes gut irritation. Yet another reason to minimize or eliminate wheat from your diet. There's absolutely nothing ""essential"" about wheat in the human diet...It simply does more harm than good...period. Many people often ask me... ""But what about the FIBER in wheat? I thought that's why it's supposed to be healthy?"" Sorry, you can get ALL of the fiber you need from fruits, veggies, and nuts, without the digestive system damage and massive blood sugar issues that are caused by wheat. Note: It's important to keep reading this page because I'll show you how to get access to ALL of my best secrets for AVOIDING wheat, but still eating amazingly delicious meals that BOOST your metabolism, BALANCE your hormones, FIGHT diabetes, and also help reduce abdominal fat. It's easier than you think, so don't think that eating healthy has to be ""boring"" like so many people foolishly believe. The 3 reasons you should NEVER use Vegetable Oils... Although vegetable oil has a healthy sounding name, it's NOT made from vegetables...As you might already know, vegetable oil actually comes from any combination of corn oil, soybean oil, canola oil, safflower oil, and/or cottonseed oil, ALL of which are absolutely terrible for your health. In fact, they are downright deadly, and I'm not exaggerating. Here's why... Reason #1 -- Vegetable oils usually contain deadly trans fats, even if non-hydrogenated You already KNOW that trans fats are deadly, so I won't go into all of the science as to why trans fats kill you and DAMAGE your cell membranes in your body...leading to all sorts of scary health problems like cancer, obesity, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and more. Knowing these facts, I'm sure you already know to stay away from foods that contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. You've heard that a million times before. However, what you probably DON'T know is that even non-hydrogenated vegetable oils (all vegetable oils are refined) also contain some trans fats due to the extremely high heat, solvents, and pressure they are exposed to during the refining process. And yes, this includes so-called ""expeller pressed"" vegetable oils as well. All of this high heat and high pressure processing along with the use of hexane solvents actually forces some of the polyunsaturated content of vegetable oils (yes, even so-called ""healthy"" canola oil) to be transformed into trans fats and something even worse that we'll talk about in a minute called ""MegaTrans"". According to Dr. Mary Enig, PhD, and Nutritional Biochemist, ""Although the Canadian government lists the trans fat content of canola at a minimal 0.2 percent, research at the University of Florida at Gainesville, found trans fat levels as high as 4.6 percent in commercial liquid canola oil"". And this is the garbage that the government and giant food conglomerates are marketing to you as a ""healthy oil""! Don't fall for it. Reason #2 -- Vegetable oils contain oxidized ""mutated fats"" that are worse than trans fat &amp; CAUSE heart attacks All vegetable oils contain oxidized fats due to the refining process and chemical reactions with the polyunsaturated fat content of vegetable oils. Expert Nutrition author, Catherine Shanahan, MD, calls the fats in vegetable oils ""MegaTrans"", because they are similar in chemistry to trans fats, but even WORSE. And MegaTrans from vegetable oils are found in almost ALL processed packaged foods, as well as virtually ALL restaurant fryers. French Fries proven to immediately harm your arteries after eating them: Free radicals formed during the refining of vegetable oils create these ""mutant"" fats, which damage your cell membranes &amp; chromosomes, and create massive inflammation in your body. The free radicals in vegetable oils also damage your arteries, which can directly lead to a heart attack. Please be aware that this isn't just a long-term risk of eating vegetable oils daily. There are also studies that show immediate dysfunction in your arteries, also called endothelial function. Catherine Shanahan, MD, cites in her book Deep Nutrition a study from New Zealand that showed that subjects who ate french fries from a restaurant fryer displayed immediate harm to their endothelial function of their arteries, going from a normal 7% dilation before eating the french fries to almost NO dilation at all (only 1%) AFTER eating the french fries. This is one thing that can cause a heart attack. If you think I'm exaggerating, think again... Dr Shanahan also surveyed hundreds of patients that were admitted to the hospital for a heart attack, and discovered that every sing le patient that just had a heart attack had consumed foods made with vegetable oils with their last meal before the heart attack...Scary huh! Think about THAT next time you order the fries with that sandwich on the menu! It really is THAT serious. Always ask to replace french fries that come with most meals with side veggies, fruit, or a salad instead. That may very well be the difference between dying tomorrow or enjoying many more years on this beautiful planet. Reason #3 -- Vegetable oils cause massive imbalances with your Omega-6 to Omega-3 fats ratio One of the other MAJOR reasons that vegetable oils are killing you is they are mostly made up of inflammatory omega-6 fats, while having very little anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats. The healthiest ratio from the scientific literature appears to be a ratio of 2:1 or even 1:1 for your omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. However, most vegetable oils skew your ratio as high as 20:1 or even 30:1 in favor of harmful inflammatory omega-6 fats. And worse yet, these omega-6 fats are NOT the innocent type found in nuts, they are the ""mutant"" damaged MegaTrans type that harm the tissues of your body. This Omega fat imbalance can be YET another reason why vegetable oils lead to heart disease, cancer, obesity, and many other degenerative diseases that WILL shorten your life significantly if you don't cut out the vegetable oils ASAP. As a quick note, the solution to all of these major problems with vegetable oils is to use healthy oils like coconut oil, olive oil, macadamia oil, avocado oil, and grass-fed butter, all of which are MUCH healthier than vegetable oils and don't cause any of the problems we've described in this section of the article. The TRUTH about sugar... You can't just ""burn off"" sugar... You've heard a million times from health experts, bloggers, and on the news that sugar is terrible for you, but most people don't truly understand WHY it's so bad... In fact, most people falsely think that if they eat sugar, they can just exercise a little bit harder that day or the next day so they can ""burn it off""... Unfortunately, that kind of thinking will lead you to an early grave. It's not as simple as just ""burning off sugar""... It's about what sugar does internally to the cells of your body, and how sugar gums up your internal workings, causing disease. Once again, I'm not exaggerating here, so pay close attention... If you knew exactly why sugar is so bad for you and exactly what it does to your cells in your body, I promise that you would think twice about eating that piece of cake, candy, sugary soft drink, fruit juice, or ice cream, or feeding them to your children. Here are just a few of the reasons that sugar is killing you... Just like we talked about above with wheat, sugar also causes extreme fluctuations in your blood sugar, and excess blood sugar causes Glycation inside your body, which accelerates the rate of aging of your organs, skin, arteries, and joints. Sugar also raises your triglycerides to dangerous levels, which can lead you to heart disease. If that weren't bad enough, eating sugar too frequently also causes type 2 diabetes in the long run because you wear out your pancreas and insulin sensitivity. And if you need even MORE reasons why sugar will kill you, sugar also slows down your white blood cells, making infection more likely, and even allowing CANCER cells a better chance to form in your body. Scary stuff huh! Of course, you already know that sugar makes you fat, and gives you excess calories without any beneficial nutrients whatsoever. To clarify, when we talk about how much damage sugar does to your body, we're NOT talking about tiny amounts such as having 5 grams of sugar from a teaspoon of honey in your tea... Small amounts of natural sugar like that are not a problem. The REAL damage occurs when you eat that piece of cake and ingest 40-50 grams of sugar in one sitting, or that bag of candy with 35+ grams of sugar, or that soft drink with 45 grams of sugar or more... Or even that so-called ""healthy"" smoothie at the local smoothie shop that contains a whopping 80 grams of sugar because of all of the fruit syrups they use in them. Now that you know why sugar, wheat, and vegetable oils are killing you and your family, maybe you'll think twice about eating cereals, breads, bagels, muffins, candy, and processed foods or fried foods from restaurants that are cooked in vegetable oil. Here are some examples of foods below that you might be eating and didn't even realize they are making you fatter, and making your fat cells ""sick""... So-Called ""Health Foods"" That Are Causing You to GAIN More Body Fat? I can't tell you how many times I've walked into the kitchen of a client of mine that has hired me for nutritional counseling, and I'm shocked by what I see... Almost every time, I see their kitchen cabinets and fridge LOADED with foods that they think are ""healthy"" (or have been deceived by clever food labels into believing are healthy), but in reality are fat-storing traps in disguise. It's not uncommon to see foods such as: whole grain breads whole grain cereals whole grain crackers (more of that wheat that's killing you) soy milk tofu or ""veggie burgers"" (non-fermented soy can be harmful to your hormones) orange juice (loaded with too much fructose that raises your triglycerides) apple juice skim milk or homogenized milk margarine (deadly trans fat or even ""MegaTrans"") pre-packaged ""diet"" dinners sport drinks protein bars (most are candy bars in disguise!) overly processed meal replacements (with more junk than healthy ingredients) rice cakes (massive blood sugar spike) pasta (more wheat to age you faster) diet ice cream or diet desserts so-called ""energy"" drinks low-fat foods (usually replaces fat with more sugar) low-carb processed foods soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil etc, etc I see this trend over and over again with almost every client when I first inspect their cabinets and the foods that they were buying that they thought were healthy. What they don't realize is that it's these exact foods that are sabotaging their fat loss efforts, increasing their cravings, and throwing their hormones out of whack.. Here's Your Simple Fat Loss Solution... So how do you repair your damaged digestive system and start melting away your embarrassing belly fat, while also increasing your energy, &amp; fighting joint pain? The simplest way is to get rid of the foods you now KNOW are damaging your system. Second, add ""fermentable fibers"" to your diet, which are also called prebiotics (sweet potato, yam, yucca, etc.) and eat a lot of fermented foods like kefir, sauerkraut, and certain types of yogurt (but most yogurts found in your grocery store are simply milk with sugar and are NOT healthy) You can also supplement with probiotics, but make sure to start slow and build up. Third, better manage your stress through better sleep patterns, exercise, and breathing techniques. Stress is known to damage your gut, so the better you handle it, the healthier your gut will be.

16 Signs Your Blood Sugar Is High & 8 Diabetes Symptoms,"16 signs your blood sugar is high &amp; 8 diabetes symptoms. The first thing that comes to mind for most people when the discussion of health and high blood sugar is brought up is diabetes. It's an extremely dangerous and deadly condition, but long before the individual is diagnosed with it, the body gives away signs that their blood sugar level is very high. This will help us stay as healthy as possible.#DiabetesSymptoms #HighBloodSugar #DiabeticMusic:https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...Summary:16. Excessive Urination/Urinating During the Night: Granted if you drink high amounts of water before you go to bed, there is a good chance you're waking up in the middle of the night to urinate. But if you're blood sugar level is too high, you could pick up a urinary tract infection which can result in excessive urinating.15. Blurred Vision: Don't overreact and go buy a pair of glasses if you begin to have temporary blurred vision. In most cases it's high blood sugar, which causes the lens in the eyes to swell up.14. Difficulty Concentrating: When the body is lacking insulin, it's unable to remove glucose from the bloodstream into the cells. This doesn't allow the body to properly function. This is why you feel tired and can't concentrate properly. High blood sugar levels can dehydrate you because the body is trying to remove excess glucose through urination.13. Dry Mouth: Because of the high glucose levels in your blood and saliva, which are caused by high blood sugar levels, your mouth becomes dry.12. Impotence: This issue which only refers to men, stems from problems that are caused by poor long-term blood sugar control. This damages the nerves and the blood vessels.11. Recurrent Infections: There are several recurring infections that need to be monitored. Dysfunction of the thyroid, adrenal and pituitary glands. Also watch out for numerous diseases in the pancreas and severe increase in blood glucose.10. Slow Healing Wounds: If you find that the smallest cuts and bruises are taking longer than usual to heal, high blood sugar levels could be the cause. It affects the nerves and can lead to poor blood circulation, making it tough for blood – need for skin repair – to reach the wounded area.9. Stomach Problems: When you have high blood sugar levels, emptying the food from your stomach could be delayed. This can lead to bloating, distention, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. 8. Constant Fatigue or Extreme Tiredness: If your thyroid level is low, there is a good chance you are going to feel tired, sleepy or depressed. In order to fight infections, it takes energy, which can result in constant fatigue and high blood sugar levels.7. Thirst: When you have high blood sugar levels, your kidneys are forced to work overtime to filter and absorb the excess sugar. In order to achieve that, liquids need to flow through the body in order to urinate the sugar.6. Dry and Itchy Skin: When there is poor blood circulation flow through the body, it causes itchy skin. The most common areas of the body that become itchiest are the lower parts of your legs.5. Always Hungry: You may be one of those people that have a big appetite, and that's fine. However, for people who normally do not have a large appetite, this could be because you're lacking a hormone called incretin. Incretin reduces the flow of sugar from the liver after consuming a meal. If you lack this hormone, food empties quicker and you'll be hungry again shortly after dinner, which increases your blood sugar level.4. Excess Abdominal Weight/Fat: This is one of the most common signs that you have high blood sugar levels. The food that you have consumed was not all able to get into the cells as energy which would nourish the cells, so in turn, you feel hungry again.3. Nerve Problems: Simply put, if your blood sugar levels are high, it can damage the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the nerves, which can lead to nerve problems.2. Skin Changes: If you begin to experience discoloration and certain growths on your skin, your blood sugar level may be high. Also, you may notice dark, thick areas of skin may begin to form on the back of your neck and your hands as well.1. Tingling and Numbness: This goes hand-in-hand with nerve damage. If you experience tingling and numbness in certain areas of your body, your blood sugar level may be high. This type of nerve damage is called neuropathy.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Subscribe to Bestie : https://goo.gl/tUqro6----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",https://t.co/IAzT0HMZBc,others

More importantly, look forward to healthily losing weight.Think of it this way. Wouldn't you feed processed cheap seeds to the birds in your area? You would get a decent birdhouse, stock it with amazing nuts and seeds that nature provides and enjoy watching them in your garden while you eat healthy too.The very first step is to open your cupboards and get rid of any artificial foods, processed meals and fill them with fresh organic foods. Make sure they're in their purest form as possible.Throw away all takeout pamphlets and if you're an avid PC user, put a web blocker app on your pc or phone to block ads from takeouts in your area.2. Eat Foods that Burn FatEating healthy foods is great, but eating foods that help you burn fat are even better. You can make mediocre changes in your dishes that end up making you a walking fat burning machine melting fat away as if it were nothing.Below we will look at a variety of foods that can help you melt the fat off your body.• PeppersChili peppers originate from Mexico, although there have been other types of Chili that originate from other countries. They contain high amounts of Vitamin A, C, and K. These vitamins reduce the risk of disease as they are full of antioxidants, but the main benefit is that they keep your metabolism ticking over.• Green TeaGreen Tea originally comes from China and is considered the healthiest drink on the planet due to the effects the high amount of antioxidants and nutrients have on the body.Apart from being a way to help you lose weight, green tea improves your brain function and can help you become more aware.• BuckwheatBuckwheat is originally from Asia but is now grown in North America. It was originally grown to feed cattle but since has grown popular amongst humans too.Buckwheat is one of the few natural, gluten-free wheat, which contains resistance starch, and also contains manganese, magnesium, copper, phosphorus, and iron.• GrapefruitThis wonderful fruit was first discovered in Barbados, although it has a sour taste, it's quite sweet too.Grapefruit has a generous amount of fiber which can help you feel quite full, which is the reason why it has been listed as helping you lose weight.• Lean Poultry and FishPoultry and fish are both high in protein and other nutrients but what we're after is the weight loss properties.Fish such as Salmon contains fatty acids that help kick-start your metabolism and poultry such as eggs provide you a healthy breakfast to give you enough energy to get through the day.• LentilsLentils are a great addition to many soups and stews which make you feel less hungry and contain a variety of health benefits.They help reduce your blood sugar levels and lower your LDL cholesterol levels but improve your gut health overall.• BlueberriesBlueberries originate from North America and can be used with a variety of dishes or enjoyed on their own.

It's a hunger suppressant, and by eating an apple, it makes all the more sense.• AlmondsAlmonds originally came from the Middle East, but now California is responsible for more than 75% of the world's almond production on one big farm.Almonds are low in carbohydrates but have a larger amount of fiber which helps suppresses your hunger while giving you the benefits of getting a lot of vitamins.• Greek YogurtGreek yogurt can help you in so many ways, but its primary use is utilizing the protein that benefits bones, muscles, hair, skin, and blood.Greek yogurt is a high protein, high fat and low carb diet and eaten in moderation will keep your metabolism intact and help you lose weight.• SpinachSpinach comes from Ancient Persia but now is grown everywhere, mostly in the USA and China. It's a big favorite for most people and is very healthy.There are many benefits of Spinach such as reducing blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of cancer and improve your vision.3. Plan your Meal PrepGetting ready to cook breakfast or lunch, you're probably organizing yourself and prepping the kitchen and getting all the ingredients ready. This is called meal planning.There are some people that plan a few weeks of exactly what they need, and there are some that simple that walk around the local market grabbing whatever they like.There is no set way to meal prep correctly, and it'll depend on person to person. What works great for your friend may not work great for you. Meal preparation is all about being organized, and the below tips will help you achieve that.• Look at Different RecipesPull out those old recipe books; browse the internet for recipes that look great to you. Speak to friends and family for recommendations; write them down and put them away safely to access them at a later date.• Organize YourselfGet a cheap calendar or fridge calendar and plan what you are going to eat for the next week. Dedicated each day to a different meal type so that Monday will be fish, Tuesday will be soup. Etc.Pick one day of the week that will be your shopping week. Look at what you will be cooking for the next week and only get those ingredients. Grab a few freezer bags and containers as any leftovers can be consumed later saving you money.• Complete your PreparationAs soon as you can, prepare your food, so wash all your greens, cut all your veg and store them in easy to use containers. The more you prepare now, the less you need to worry about later on.A handy tip is to use plastic tub containers to store your meals in. Only get what you require as you don't want to clutter your home. A washable black marker will be a lifesaver as you'll be marking the plastic tubs with each day of the week as to when you're supposed to eat that specific meal.If you plan your meals according, it will stop you from binge eating. You eventually become mindful of what you eat and will start to see yourself lose weight.4. Become Active and Drop WeightDiet and exercise are important to your overall health and mid-section. It's beneficial if you can do a mixture of aerobic exercise like running and resistance training like weight training.By setting a goal like a few inches lost or a couple of pounds dropped will give you something to focus on and help you achieve your goals.Consume around 500 calories less than you normally would and exercise at the same time. These two go hand in hand, and you will see the weight drop off.Just don't starve yourself and exercise all the time. That is cause for you to burn out and put the weight back on.By eating clean, you will increase your energy levels throughout the day as you will be primed to take on any exercise you plan. Avoid large meals as they will make you feel tired and bloated which makes the feeling of exercise a past time.An exercise and clean eating combination offer many health benefits, but the main one is that your brain will function at optimal levels.5. Stay HydratedWater makes up more than half of the fluids in your body, so drinking enough water will keep your body working correctly. If you avoid water, you may feel tired, find it hard to work out and can even suffer from headaches.While the recommendation is to drink around 3 liters of water per day, it will vary from person to person but in general women need 11 cups of water per day and mean need 16 cups of water per day.Drinking water provides you with many benefits such as:• Increasing your Brain PowerIf you think caffeine can you provide you energy, think again. The next time you need a mental boost, ditch the coffee and drink water. Your brain is three-quarters water, so it's best to keep it topped up.• Assists with Weight ManagementWater helps you get rid of toxins and fatty-by products and help you feel full. Water can improve your metabolism which aids in burning fat; it's also a natural hunger suppressant.The General Rule Is:Drink as much water as you possibly can.There is no need to count how much you drink,just drink enough and it will help you lose weight.You don't have to struggle to lose weight, focus on the above points and you'll be miles ahead of everyone else. You'll have much more energy from weight loss, and clean eating will make that all easier.",https://t.co/fBaoZtnD7u,others
Mango Nutrition Helps Lower Blood Sugar & Boost Brain Health,"Just the taste of mango can create a delightful tropical experience for your taste buds, but did you know that the mighty mango also delivers a healthy dose of vitamins, minerals and enzymes to benefit health? Not only that, but mango nutrition is also a great high-fiber food and high-antioxidant food as well. It's no wonder, then, that the mango is often referred to as the ""king of fruits.""The name mango come from the Tamil word mangkay or mangay — however, when Portuguese traders arrived and settled in Western India, they embraced the name manga, which eventually gave way to the modern-day version of mango.Throughout history, every part of the mango — including the fruit itself, its skin, leaves, bark of its tree and even the pit — has been used as a health remedy in one form or another. But before diving headlong into all things ""mango nutrition,"" here's more of a backdrop on the sweet and delicious mango.What Are Mangos? Types of MangosNot to be confused with a tropical American hummingbird going by the same name, the mango is an oval-shaped, creamy, juicy and fleshy tropical fruit. It is actually considered a drupe or stone fruit, meaning it has a characteristic outer fleshy part surrounding a shell (pit or stone) with a seed inside. Coconuts, cherries, plums, peaches, olives and dates are also drupes.With a flavor often described as a cross between a peach and a pineapple — and like the benefits of pineapple, providing well over 20 vitamins and minerals — the mango is the fruit of a large evergreen that grows almost exclusively in the tropics and sub-tropics. Mangos can vary in skin color — from green to red or yellow to orange — but the inner flesh of the mango is typically golden yellow.Mango seeds traveled with humans from Asia to the Middle East, East Africa and South America in approximately 300 or 400 A.D. and were first cultivated in Malaysia, Eastern Asia as well as Eastern Africa, but Portuguese explorers introduced mangos to the people of Africa and Brazil.The popularity of the mango has continued to grow and today, the mango currently hold the honor of being named the most widely consumed fruit in the world. And know this: In India, giving someone a basket of mangos is considered an act of friendship.Mangos have long been used in traditional forms of medicine thanks to their healing properties and the extensive mango benefits that this stone fruit has to offer as well. In Ayurvedic medicine, the mango is believed to be very nourishing and thought to help promote proper elimination, soothe the throat and increase fluids in the body by creating moisture.Meanwhile, in Traditional Chinese Medicine, mangos are used to strengthen digestion, build up bodily fluids and ease coughing. Mangos are also thought to increase the body's inner heat, which can improve circulation and nourish qi, which is the vital energy of the organs.Mango Nutrition FactsBelonging to the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae and going by the scientific name Mangifera indica L., mangos are filled with vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. Each serving is also relatively low in mango calories, making it an incredibly healthy and nutrient-dense food. So which nutrients are present in mango?One cup of raw mango fruit contains approximately:107 calories28 grams carbohydrates1 gram protein0.4 gram fat3 grams dietary fiber45.7 milligrams vitamin C (76 percent DV)1,262 international units vitamin A (25 percent DV)0.2 milligram vitamin B6 (11 percent DV)1.8 milligram vitamin E (9 percent DV)6.9 micrograms vitamin K (9 percent DV)0.2 milligram copper (9 percent DV)257 milligrams potassium (7 percent DV)23.1 micrograms folate (6 percent DV)0.1 milligram riboflavin (6 percent DV)0.1 milligram thiamine (6 percent DV)In addition to the nutrients listed above, the mango nutrition profile also contains a small amount of niacin, magnesium and pantothenic acid — as well as powerful antioxidants like zeaxanthin, quercetin, astragalin and beta-carotene.Mango Nutrition: Top 11 Mango BenefitsLowers Blood Sugar LevelsRegulates Blood PressureBoosts Brain HealthMay Protect Against Macular DegenerationSupports Strong BonesOptimizes Heart HealthCombats Cancer Cell GrowthSlows Signs of AgingIncreases Immune FunctionImproves Digestive HealthMay Protect Against Asthma1. Lowers Blood Sugar LevelsRich in fiber plus an array of power-packed antioxidants, adding mango to your diet can have a big impact on blood sugar levels. For example, one study out of Oklahoma actually found that supplementing with mango for 12 weeks significantly reduced blood sugar levels in obese adults.The fiber in mangos may also help promote normal blood sugar levels. Fiber passes through the gastrointestinal tract undigested, slowing the absorption of sugar in the process. With three grams, or up to 12 percent of your daily fiber needs ,in a single serving, enjoying mangos as part of a well-rounded healthy diet can support overall glycemic control.2. Regulates Blood PressureSometimes called ""the silent killer,"" high blood pressure affects an estimated 70 million American adults, and about one in five is completely unaware that he or she has it. High blood pressure places extra strain on the heart, forcing it to work harder to pump blood throughout the body so it can continue to work efficiently.Mangos are rich in magnesium and potassium, which are two essential nutrients that are absolutely vital when it comes to regulating blood pressure. Plus, they're also naturally low in sodium, a micronutrient that should be limited in those with high blood pressure.3. Boosts Brain HealthConsidered one of the best brain foods, mango nutrition is packed with vitamin B6, which is essential for maintaining brain function. In fact, some research suggests that a deficiency in this key vitamin could contribute to impaired cognitive function and neurological decline. Vitamin B6 and other B vitamins are also crucial for maintaining the function of brain neurotransmitters and aid in supporting a healthy mood as well as regular sleep patterns.4. May Protect Against Macular DegenerationAge-related macular degeneration is a common condition that causes destruction of the macula, the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision. It can lead to night blindness, blurry, distorted vision and even blindness.In addition to the wealth of vitamins and minerals supplied by the mango nutrition profile, this powerful fruit also contains the antioxidant zeaxanthin. Zeaxanthin works to filter out harmful blue light rays, thereby playing a protective role in eye health as well as possibly preventing macular degeneration symptoms. Studies show that increasing your intake of key antioxidants like zeaxanthin can help increase macular pigment density to preserve vision and prevent macular degeneration.5. Supports Strong BonesMangos are an excellent source of bone-building vitamin K, cramming in up to 9 percent of your daily needs in just one cup. This important nutrient is involved in bone metabolism and helps maintain adequate amounts of calcium in the bone tissue. Interestingly enough, a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition actually found that a vitamin K deficiency may be associated with lower bone density and an increased risk of fractures. (10)6. Optimizes Heart HealthHeart disease is a major problem in the United States and around the world, accounting for an estimated 31.5 percent of global deaths in 2013. Fortunately, switching up your diet and adding more nutrient-rich foods like mango to your menu may help optimize heart health to protect against heart disease.Mangos contain high amounts of pectin, a type of soluble fiber that can help naturally lower cholesterol levels in the blood. Combined with the low sodium levels as well as high amounts of potassium and B vitamins, mango nutrition may help keep your heart healthy and reduce the risk of heart disease.7. Combats Cancer Cell GrowthAs previously mentioned, mangos are high in pectin. Pectin not only helps lower cholesterol levels in the blood, but may also guard against prostate cancer, according to some in vitro studies. A compound within pectin combines with galectin-3, a protein that plays a role in inflammation and cancer progression. Additionally, high dietary intakes of vitamin C and beta-carotene, an antioxidant found within the mango, have also been linked to increased survival rates in men with prostate cancer.Plus, one in vitro study conducted by the University of Queensland even found that extracts of mango flesh and peels were effective at blocking the growth of breast cancer cells as well. Although research is still in the early stages, this suggests that mangos may be a helpful part of natural cancer treatment protocol.8. Slows Signs of AgingMangos are jam-packed with several anti-aging nutrients that can help slow the signs of aging to keep you looking youthful for as long as possible.In particular, mangos are rich in vitamin A, a micronutrient that helps promote tissue repair and is often used topically to fight wrinkles and skin aging. They're also loaded with vitamin C, an antioxidant that protects against oxidative damage and boosts the production of collagen. Collagen is a type of protein that can slow signs of aging by reducing joint pain and preserving skin elasticity.9. Increases Immune FunctionYour immune system is your body's first line of defense against unwanted invaders and has everything to do with keeping you healthy and feeling your best. Squeezing in about 76 percent of the vitamin C you need for an entire day, mangos can help support a healthy immune system to ward off illness and infection.A study in the Annals of Nutrition &amp; Metabolism actually found that getting enough vitamin C in your diet could help reduce the duration and severity of respiratory infections like the common cold, plus decrease the incidence of other conditions, such as malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea infections.10. Improves Digestive HealthWith three grams of fiber in a single cup of fresh mango nutrition, adding this nutritious fruit to your daily diet can do wonders when it comes to the health of your digestive tract. Fiber can help add bulk to the stool to increase stool frequency in people with constipation. High-fiber foods like the mango may also help protect against other gastrointestinal conditions, including hemorrhoids, GERD, intestinal ulcers and diverticulitis.11. May Protect Against AsthmaAs you may recall from the mango nutrition lineup, mangos are chock-full of beta-carotene and vitamin A. Due to this, it could potentially act as an asthma natural remedy. Asthma occurs as a result of inflammation in air passages, resulting in temporary narrowing of airways transporting air from the nose and mouth to the lungs. This leads to difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, chest tightness or even death.Studies show that levels of vitamin A and beta-carotene may be lower in children with asthma. Although it's unclear exactly what role these essential nutrients may play, these findings indicate that they may have some impact on allergic diseases, such as asthma.Mango vs. PapayaThe mango and papaya are two types of tropical fruit that have garnered a good amount of popularity for their delicious taste and versatility. Both are sweet, fleshy and loaded with an impressive array of important nutrients.That said, there are several notable differences between these two fruits. For starters, they each belong to a different family of plants. Mangos are native to South Asia, whereas papayas are thought to originate in the tropical regions of the Americas. In terms of appearance, the papaya is more oblong and has several seeds inside while the mango houses a single pit.When it comes to nutrition, both are considered incredibly nutrient-rich ingredients. In a single cup, papaya packs in more vitamin C, vitamin A and folate, but the same amount of mango is higher in fiber, vitamin B6 and vitamin E.Where to Find and How to Use MangosThere are a number of different types of mangos out there, each of which has slight differences in taste and appearance. Although there may also be some minute distinctions between Kent mango nutrition vs. Alphonso mango nutrition, honey mango nutrition (also known as Ataulfo mango nutrition) and Kesar mango nutrition, they can all be used in similar ways and are brimming with important vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that your body needs.When selecting your mangos, get your hands on them and press them slightly. They should ""give"" somewhat from the pressure of your fingertips, and then you should see a slight depression on the mango's surface. That is the easiest way to select a ripe mango that is ready to be enjoyed.If your mangos are still a bit unripened, place them in a paper bag in a warm place, which will help them ripen within two days. However, you can also choose to keep unripened mangos at room temperature, which will take them about a week to ripen. Storage in the refrigerator, however, will make them last for somewhere around two weeks.Wondering how to eat a mango to take advantage of the many mango benefits that this tasty fruit has to offer? There are so many ways to enjoy mangos, but perhaps one of the best ways is to have it fresh — all by itself. You can dice it or slice it, but either way, it's a heavenly treat!You can also add it to other like kinds of fruits, including fresh pineapple, kiwi and papaya, making a delectable tropical fruit salad. It's also great added to your healthy smoothie recipes. You can even jazz it up to create a savory salsa with mango, papaya, jalapeño, chipotle pepper and cayenne pepper and pair it with heathy dipping chips or use it to top off your favorite type of tacos.Mango RecipesThere are plenty of options for how to eat a mango and a number of tasty mango recipes to choose from. Here are a few delicious and nutritious ideas to help get you started:History/FactsNative to southern and southeast Asia, the mango is one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics. The common mango, or Indian mango, is the only mango tree routinely cultivated in several tropical and sub-tropical areas. It originated between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago in what is now present-day eastern India, Pakistan and Burma.Prior to their appearance and cultivation in California in approximately 1880, mango cultivation is thought to have begun in Florida and Hawaii earlier in the 1800s.As the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines, as well as the national tree of Bangladesh, the mango fruit and its leaves are used ritually to decorate religious ceremonies, community festivals and celebrations as well as weddings. It should come as no surprise to note that many stories in Indian mythology mention the mango plant. In fact, Buddha is said to have meditated in a mango grove under the shade of a mango tree.India holds the title of being the world's major producer of mangos — with over 1,000 varieties of mangos available — although China, Mexico, Brazil and Thailand cultivate mangos as well. In the U.S., Florida is the chief producer of mangos.The mango is not only fascinating due to its longevity and popularity as a fruit, but it also has some unusual relatives. Did you know that mangos are from the same family as pistachios and cashews? It's true. Likewise, mango trees can grow to great heights — anywhere from 65 to 100 feet tall. They can also live for extended periods of time. In fact, some mango trees have lived for more than 300 years and continue to bear fruit at such a ripe old age.PrecautionsAlthough there are plenty of benefits of mango, there are some downsides that need to be considered as well.Since mangos are of the same family as pistachios or cashews, if you have an allergy to these nuts, then you should probably avoid mangos. Additionally, mangos are also very distant relatives of poison ivy, so some people may be sensitive to them. Some people with latex allergies have also had a cross-reaction to mangos, so use caution and be sure to address any concerns with your doctor.Many people also wonder: Can you eat mango skin? Mangos and their peels contain tiny amounts of urushinol, which can trigger dermatitis in those sensitive to it and may also cause food allergy symptoms like itching, burning and swelling of the skin, so it's best to avoid the skin whenever possible.Finally, keep in mind that there are a relatively high amount of calories in mango compared to other fruits, so don't gorge on more than one at a time. Instead, have a great dessert finish to a healthy meal, or mix with some protein (like goat milk or coconut milk) for breakfast or enjoy alongside some whey protein for a snack.Final Thoughts on Mango NutritionThe mango is a delicious tropical fruit that is native to South Asia and enjoyed for its sweet flavor and extensive nutrient profile.Each serving of fresh fruit contains a relatively low amount of mango calories, plus plenty of fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A and vitamin B6.What are the benefits of eating mango? Thanks to its impressive nutritional content, potential mango nutritional benefits include lower blood pressure and blood sugar levels, improved heart and brain health, increased immune function, decreased signs of aging, better digestive health, and more.You can eat mangos as is for a guilt-free sweet treat or try adding them to smoothies, fruit salads, savory salsas or even tacos.Enjoy this tasty stone fruit as part of a well-balanced, nutritious diet to maximize the potential benefits and help improve your overall health.Read Next: Plum Benefits Your Digestion &amp; Cardiovascular HealthFrom the sound of it, you might think leaky gut only affects the digestive system,but in reality it can affect more.

Can Diabetes Be Prevented? 5 Tips To Hamper Blood Sugar Disease,"Type 2 diabetes is a common disease that usually develops in people who have a family history of blood sugar illness. Those who are diagnosed with prediabetes even obese people are also at a higher risk of the condition. Luckily, there are ways to prevent its development. Five of them are found below.Fiber-Rich FoodDietary fiber prevents obesity and diabetes. It is usually found in plant foods such as grains, vegetables and fruits, according to University Health News Daily. The most common sources of insoluble fiber are wheat bran, whole grains, cucumbers, skins of apples and grapes. Soluble fiber, on the other hand, aids in better digestion and is commonly found in beans, nuts, fruits, oats, seeds, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes and asparagus.The recommended intake of these fiber-rich foods is 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams for men. Specifically, you may also opt to eat at least two or three cups of these vegetables and fruits per day. Three servings of beans, lentils or peas a week, eating whole-grain bread instead of white bread and eating brown rice instead of white rice also does the trick.Healthy DietAs per Mayo Clinic, low-carb and glycemic index diets help you lose weight, but their long-term benefits in preventing diabetes remain unknown. Although these help you avoid obesity, which is a common cause of the blood sugar disease, it is more important to mind your nutrient intake than prioritizing weight loss.The recommended healthy diet for diabetics requires the patient to consume three meals a day at regular times. This helps you generate sufficient insulin and supports medication. Strict compliance with a diabetic diet also controls your blood sugar levels and manage your weight.The American Diabetes Association endorses the plate method that tells which portions of your plate is allotted for a particular ingredient. The portions are as follows: fill half of the plate with non-starchy vegetables such as tomatoes and spinach; a quarter of the plate must be filled with protein-rich food such as tuna, lean pork or chicken; the last quarter should then be allotted for whole grains such as brown rice or green peas.Physical Fitness ProgramAccording to WebMD, excess weight puts you at a higher risk of diabetes. You can regulate your pounds by performing regular aerobic and resistance training exercises that let you shed off weight fast, lower your blood sugar levels and boost your sensitivity to insulin.The recommended physical exercise for diabetics is a combination of aerobics and resistance training. You can perform at least 30 minutes of low-to-moderate-intensity aerobic exercise five times per week. For those who opt for a lighter exercise, ellipticals and stair-climbing also work.Avoid Trigger FoodsAccording to Help Guide, a diabetic must avoid trans fats contained in deep-fried foods. Fast foods are also high in sugar along with white bread, sugary cereals and refined pasta. Processed and red meat also trigger higher insulin levels and low-fat products that contain added sugars such as fat-free yogurt.Regular CheckupsAnother way to avoid diabetes is opting for a regular checkup with an endocrinologist. Even if you perform regular exercises and eat healthily, you regularly need to check on your body's insulin levels.You can prevent diabetes by seeing your doctor and undergo an exam every three to six months. This procedure checks on your blood pressure and other parameters to know if you harbor diabetes symptoms. Seeing your dentist every six months also helps you check if you are diabetes-free.",https://t.co/CpFvsc3N0k,others

Migraines and Blood Sugar,"Migraines and Blood SugarSusie called me, unable to keep her massage appointment with me due to her migraine headache. She was my massage therapist, very effective at what she did. One massage from Susie was all I needed every month, and I felt strong and limber.She had had migraine headaches her entire life but they had come on strong in the last few weeks. We discussed what might be triggering them and found that one possible reason why she was having the migraines was related to poor eating habits.For example, this particular headache came on around 10 p.m. and the last meal she had eaten was lunch at 3 p.m. She wasn't usually a breakfast eater, which means she essentially only had one meal that day, plus a snack.Low Blood Sugar Is Often OverlookedMigraine headaches are a symptom of low blood sugar in some people. Normally, here's how the blood sugar system works in the body:You eat a meal. The foods in that meal are broken down by enzymes and the sugar in the food is released to the blood. The blood sugar rises.Your pancreas detects the rise in blood sugar and then produces insulin to bring the blood sugar level within the normal range, 80-120 mg/dl.If the blood sugar level initially rose too high, the pancreas had to produce more insulin than what is normally needed. The result is that the blood sugar can go down into the low blood sugar zone. It will stay there until you eat again.The lunch she had eaten had a fair share of high Glycemic index foods, so we can expect that her blood sugar level initially rose too high. This released a higher than normal amount of insulin which brought her blood sugar down too low. Her migraine headache started around 7 p.m., which is the expected time that low blood sugar would start to cause a migraine headache or other symptoms.Ad Results for migraine therapyThe Basics about Low Blood Sugar SymptomsWhen you eat a meal, your blood sugar level should stay within the normal zone for at least 4 hours. This means you should not be hungry, should not have cravings, and should not feel fatigued for at least four hours. However, by incorporating high Glycemic index foods, you can expect to be hungry in as little as 1 hour later after completing your meal. The symptoms of low blood sugar may also accompany the hunger. Here's a list of those symptoms:FatiguePassing outAngrySlurred wordsCan't concentrateIrritableHeadacheTake things personallyBad cravingsDepressedWill eat anything in sightNo will powerHallucinationsPsychotic symptomsIf migraine headaches are caused by low blood sugar, the answer is meal planning, not a pharmaceutical drug. Meal planning allows Susie to keep her blood sugar levels stable all day long, and avoid getting any migraine.Where the idea came from that people can go without eating breakfast is unknown. The fact is that your human physiology is made to run on small frequent meals during the day over a 10-12 hour period of time, with the exception of when you are fasting. Trying to buck the system by skipping meals creates erratic patterns that increase the stress in the body.If you are eating meals erratically and have migraine headaches, change this one thing and eat regular meals for a month. Keep a journal of how many migraine headaches you get. I know you'll be amazed at what you learn during this month! Ad Results for migraine therapy",https://t.co/gqm9n2i6KC,others
How to Lower Blood Sugar,"Originally published on HVMN by Ryan RodalWhat does it mean if you have high blood sugar? Maybe you are under immense stress, or haven't had the best diet lately, or have been fairly inactive. Even a big, carb-heavy meal will lead to higher blood sugar. Just because you once registered high blood sugar doesn't mean you're immediately at risk of poor health. But consistently high blood sugar should be taken seriously. It's usually related to a few health concerns—most often, diabetes. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are characterized by high levels of blood sugar (or blood glucose).Type 1 diabetes usually begins in childhood and is considered an autoimmune condition. In cases of type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces little-to-no insulin. Generally, type 1 is caused by a genetic predisposition—meaning most people are born with it.Type 2 diabetes is far more common, accounting for a majority of all cases. This form of diabetes is typically developed in older children and adults, but can occur in people of all ages. In type 2 diabetes, the body fails to properly use and store glucose because it doesn't respond to insulin. Obesity is one of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.Diabetics also tend to have other health issues, often relating to processes involved with the heart, kidney, eyes, and blood vessels. According to a study from 2015, type 2 diabetes has become worryingly prevalent in the American population; 12% – 14% of adults are estimated to have the disease.1Even before diagnosis, having higher-than-recommended blood sugar levels can be harmful to your health and may ultimately be a sign that you are on the path to developing type 2 diabetes. This is called ""pre-diabetes."" Pre-diabetes means that you have blood sugar levels that are higher than recommended (possibly due to insulin resistance), but below what is considered in the diabetic range. An additional 38% of the population has been diagnosed with pre-diabetes.What role does elevated blood sugar play in diabetes, pre-diabetes, and obesity? And how can you lower your blood sugar? Do you even need to lower it in the first place?Let's explore the science behind the data to understand how blood sugar is correlated to these health concerns.Science Behind Blood SugarMany people use the terms ""sugar"" and ""glucose"" interchangeably, but their differences are nuanced. All forms of sugar consumed must be converted into glucose as a fuel source for the body; this energy is created through a process called glycolysis. Any extra glucose from the diet is stored in the body as glycogen.When present, the brain and body prefer to burn carbohydrate (and thus glucose). The brain is reliant on carbs, but the rest of the body can switch to burn fat in between carb-rich meals. Glucose stores are low compared to the seemingly endless bodily fat stores. Thus, on a typical eating plan, carbs or sugars are regularly consumed and metabolized into glucose to be used as energy for the brain.However, if you don't eat carbs, small amounts of glucose can also be made through non-carbohydrate food sources through a process called gluconeogenesis. The body can also slowly learn to make ketones from fat, and ketones can supplement glucose as brain food. While glucose can power the body, uncontrolled levels can lead to complications.Diabetes is a disease characterized by high blood sugar (glucose) levels. In healthy humans, blood glucose levels are controlled by the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. The insulin acts as a regulator, lowering blood glucose levels as needed.When you eat certain food, blood glucose levels increase. Insulin is secreted from the pancreas to normalize levels through the uptake of glucose into the body's cells. In people with type 2 diabetes, cells don't respond correctly to insulin. The result? Blood sugar doesn't get into cells and thus, can't be stored for energy. When sugar can't enter these cells, that's when high levels of blood sugar occur (this is called hyperglycemia). Connection Between Weight and Blood SugarAlthough a definite link cannot be established, there is some evidence to suggest weight gain is often associated with increased blood glucose. A study showed weight gain increased risk of diabetes among overweight adults.2 Weight loss was shown to have major beneficial effects over time. Every kg of body weight lost annually was associated with a 33% lower risk of diabetes.2For people who are considered overweight and have high blood glucose, improving body composition may help lower blood glucose levels thereby lowering the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing WeightMaintaining a healthy weight is key for overall health.Many studies have shown being overweight has been linked to hypertension and type 2 diabetes.3 There is no one-size-fits-all weight for each and every person. However, for many people having a body mass index (BMI) below 25 is considered within the normal weight range. BMI calculators online can help determine whether or not you are considered overweight.4Even modest weight gain can have a substantial impact on the development of diabetes.5Careful monitoring and maintenance of weight is important for overall health, especially in the case of diabetes prevention.

Lowering Blood Sugar Through DietThe most direct way to impact blood sugar levels is through healthy diet. Blood sugar or blood glucose is directly affected by the foods that we eat; carbohydrates are readily converted into glucose, entering the bloodstream and becoming blood sugar.It's important to make the right dietary choices to minimize the risk of high blood sugar, and potentially developing type 2 diabetes. Instead of a diet, think about these strategies as lifestyle changes. Consume the Right CarbsThe body converts dietary carbs into glucose to be used as energy. Because carbs are so readily converted into glucose, foods high in carbohydrate have the largest impact on blood sugar levels (which normally increase after a high-carb meal). But when you consistently consume too much sugar, the pancreas will secrete extra insulin; and over time, it can't produce enough to keep blood glucose at normal levels.One way of maintaining healthy blood sugar is to simply eat the right type of carbohydrates.Just like calories—not all carbs are created equal. Every source of carbohydrates has a Glycemic Index (GI), which is a ranking of carbohydrates in food relative to how blood glucose is affected. Carb sources with a GI index of 55 or less digest slowly, causing a lower and slower rise in blood glucose. Commonly, they're referred to as ""complex carbs."" Carb sources with a GI index closer to 100 are considered ""simple carbs,"" broken down quickly to be used as energy.But what makes a carbohydrate complex or simple? Often, it's how processed the food is. More processed, sugary items have likely been stripped of all natural fiber, leaving it to be rapidly metabolized into glucose. Whole grains, on the other hand, will have a lower glycemic index (GI).Consuming low GI carbohydrate sources may help manage blood sugar levels to stay within normal range.Foods with a low glycemic index include meats, oats, beans, lentils, legumes, sweet potatoes, corn, yams, some fruits, and all non-starchy vegetables. Consume Little or No CarbsInstead of considering what types of carbs you'll eat, another approach is to consume little-to-no carbs. Studies have shown that limiting carbohydrates is an effective strategy for improving glycemic control.Consuming very few (or zero) carbs and higher amounts of fat can control blood sugar and limit your glycemic response, which can help prevent diabetes. There have been numerous instances in which diabetics have benefited from low carbohydrate diets. Andrew Koutnik, a graduate researcher at the University of South Florida found that type 1 diabetics were able to lower their blood sugar levels to normal range on a low carb diet.7 He says, ""I simply took the foods in my diet with the highest elevation in blood glucose and replaced them with nutrient-dense fat sources."" His TED Talk provides anecdotal evidence of using low carbs to combat type 1 diabetes.In 1976, another researcher named Bruce Bistrian discovered that seven cases of type 2 diabetes were reversed within one year on a low-calorie ketogenic diet, which employs a low-carb, high-fat eating regimen.8,9 Individuals on a ketogenic diet saw better improvements in health compared to a low-glycemic index diet.10 Increase Fiber IntakeFiber can help you control blood sugar levels.In diabetics, soluble fiber can slow the absorption of sugar and help improve blood sugar levels by controlling glucose and insulin spikes.11 If you have (or are at risk of) type 2 diabetes, introducing high-fiber foods into your diet may help control high blood sugar. Fiber will pass through your digestive tract and will not cause a large spike in blood sugar, and it has been shown to be helpful in managing type 2 diabetes.The national fiber recommendations for individuals over 50 is to consume 30g – 38g daily for men and 25g per day for women. Another guideline is to simply consume 14g of dietary fiber per every 1,000 calories in your diet. Try adding more fiber to your diet if you are looking to lower your blood sugar. Count Calories and Monitor Food IntakeBeing overweight or obese has been linked to high blood sugar and an increased risk of diabetes. Like it or not, one of the best ways to lose weight is through a caloric deficit, consuming less energy than you expend. A healthy weight has been proven to help lower blood sugar levels, thereby lowering your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.13Ever been to a restaurant and got served a plate the size of your head? Portion control can be difficult, but today, when portion sizes seem to get bigger and bigger, it can be a method to help you lose weight. Although not as precise, studies have shown that portion control has been an effective way to help obese individuals lose weight.14 General ""I'll finish eating when I'm satisfied"" portion control may work for some people, but precise methods will provide more consistent results. Some of the best ways to make counting calories easier include:Use a food scale: it can be difficult to accurately determine caloric intake without determining precise serving sizesUse a food diary app: there are several free apps that will record calories and servingsLearn to read food labels: you should learn to read serving sizes to more accurately record meals in your food diaryEat slower: studies have shown the speed at which you eat can have a direct effect on obesity, BMI, and waist circumference. Eating slower may prevent weight gainCounting calories and constantly monitoring food intake may be time-consuming, but it can pay dividends for weight loss, which means dividends for overall health. Additional Ways to Lower Blood SugarDiet may be the most direct and obvious way to keep your weight within healthy levels and help you control blood sugar. In addition to diet, there are also other techniques to supplement your journey along the way. Sleep MoreIt's no secret adequate sleep is essential for overall health and well-being. Sleep can help lower stress, strengthen our immune system, and decrease blood pressure. Sleep is also important for mental function including: alertness, memory consolidation, mood regulation, and physical health. Poor sleeping habits also affect blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.Slow wave sleep (SWS) is thought to be the most restorative sleep stage, as it affects hormonal changes. These hormones impact glucose regulation. Studies show when people do not get enough SWS, they have decreased levels of insulin sensitivity without an adequate compensatory increase in insulin release. This leads to an increased risk of diabetes due to reduced glucose tolerance.16 Reduced sleep quality may contribute to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.The benefits of a good night's rest are important for maintaining hormonal balance and glucose regulation. But just how much sleep should you be getting? The amount of sleep required will differ depending upon age. For adults, seven to nine hours of sleep are recommended. At HVMN, we know getting enough sleep is vital for performance. That's why we developed Yawn—it's our non-habit-forming sleep aid shown to decrease time it takes to get to sleep and improve sleep quality, leaving you feeling refreshed upon waking.17,18,19 Drink Apple Cider VinegarApple cider vinegar has many benefits to overall health and wellness. Studies have suggested ingesting vinegar before sleeping may favorably impact waking glucose concentrations in people with type 2 diabetes.20The everyday kitchen staple can influence the body's response to sugar by improving insulin sensitivity, with studies indicating vinegar can improve postprandial insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant subjects.21An easy way to incorporate apple cider vinegar into your diet is by creating vinegar-based salad dressings. You can also mix two teaspoons into a glass of water and drink it that way. The use of apple cider vinegar is an inexpensive remedy to potentially improve blood sugar levels. Exogenous KetonesA low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diet and the state of endogenous ketosis is a great way to bring blood sugar down over time. Focusing on consuming healthy fats, along with general carb restriction, will undoubtedly lower insulin and glucose.Interestingly, exogenous ketones such as HVMN Ketone can also regulate blood sugar in the short term. But it doesn't require weeks of dieting to get into ketosis, so the effects on blood sugar are fundamentally different, because the body can still consume carbs and be in ketosis with HVMN Ketone.Studies have shown that HVMN Ketone lowers blood sugar and may even reduce the insulin spike if you consume carbs.22 Maybe it's not just the macros of the food you don't consume—maybe the food you do eat can have a direct blood-sugar lowering effect. Exercising RegularlyRegular exercise in conjunction with a proper diet can help you maintain or lose weight. People with type 2 diabetes can benefit from aerobic exercise, because physical activity is effective for reducing visceral fat as well as liver adipose tissue.A single bout of exercise can increase insulin sensitivity for up to sixteen hours through multiple adaptations in glucose transport and metabolism.23 When you exercise, blood sugar is more effectively used for energy and muscle contraction.Exercise can come in several forms including walking, running, biking, swimming, boxing, and weight lifting. The most important part of exercise is making the time to do it.Regularly Monitor Blood Sugar LevelsRegular monitoring of blood sugar levels will help determine where you stand. If you are pre-diabetic, it's important to get levels down to normal range to prevent full diabetes from occurring.24 If you already have type 1 or type 2 diabetes you must regularly check and log blood sugar levels to prevent seizures or a diabetic coma.If you are not pre-diabetic, type 1, or type 2, it is still important to check readings regularly. Blood sugar levels are fluid and always fluctuating. Based on test results, you can adjust your diet (or medication if applicable) to help regulate blood sugar levels.There are different ways of checking blood sugar.Fasting Plasma Glucose Monitoring: fasted glucose levels are considered the baseline, used to compare against times when sugar was ben consumed. In order to obtain fasted plasma glucose, don't eat for twelve hours prior to measurement. Then, prick your finger and obtain a small drop of blood to be used on a test strip. The strip is then placed into a glucose meter that reads blood sugar levels. Normal fasted glucose levels range from 100 – 125. If your blood sugar is 126 or higher you may be at risk for diabetes or pre-diabetes.Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: in this method, you are given a measured dose of glucose (approximately 75g) after taking the fasting glucose test. Blood is tested prior to the intake of glucose, immediately afterwards, and two hours later. The two hour measurement is most important. Normal range is considered blood glucose of less than 140. If your blood sugar is 140 – 199 after the second test, you may be at risk for pre-diabetes. If your blood sugar is 200 or higher after the second test, you could be at risk for diabetes.Hemoglobin A1C: this method of blood sugar testing provides data over a three month period. As blood sugar levels are elevated over time, the sugar molecules will bind with the hemoglobin. Some of the sugar molecules will bind with the hemoglobin. The HbA1C tests determines the percentage of hemoglobin with bound glucose and is considered a much better measurement of long term glucose control. Using a percentage of glycosylated Hb, the HbA1C tests determine the percentage of hemoglobin with bound glucose. Hb A1C tests consider A1C levels of 4.5 – 5.6 range to be normal. An A1C test of 5.7 – 6.4 is considered pre-diabetic and 6.5 or higher is considered diabetic.Glucose levels can vary significantly depending on many outstanding factors, like sleep and diet. It's important to continually monitor levels on a regular basis to get a clearer picture of health.Lowering Blood Sugar for Overall HealthKeeping your blood sugar within normal recommended ranges is important for overall health.By effectively controlling these levels you are less likely to develop diabetes. Make smart lifestyle decisions, including practising regular exercise along with having a proper diet. There is no excuse when it comes to your health. Stay healthy. Stay strong.

Initial Blood Sugar Levels in Allegedly Diabetic Police Detainees in South London over a 4 Year Period. J Forensic Sci &amp; Criminal Inves. 2016; 1(1): 555554. DOI: 10.19080/JFSCI.2016.01.555554 Go to When questioned as part of the routine risk assessment by the custody sergeant, when prisoners are bought to a police station, some may then falsely declare themselves to be ill or on medication for chronic illnesses. This results in a referral to either the custody nurse or the duty FME. The motives for these false allegations are varied, but the risks of giving such false information especially relating to type, dosage and frequency of medication are potentially fatal. In those who have declared themselves to be diabetic it has occasionally been felt that in retrospect not all of them were being truthful. A review has been done of the results over a 4-year period of those who had declared themselves to be diabetic and agreed to have a blood test done. This has shown that 65% have a blood sugar level in the normal range on initial testing. The importance of repeated blood sugars during their detention is stressed for monitoring and as part of the handover to the next clinician. It is vital that these results be logged in the official custody record for later reference. Incidents have occurred when diabetics have pretended to inject their insulin in the misguided anticipation of a transfer to hospital when they become ill. All dosages of insulin should be double checked and self administration by the patient very carefully observed. The treatment of hypoglycemia using easily available and measured sugar portions from high street coffee shops is also discussed from a practical and common sense approach that is so often required in custodial medicine. Keywords: Diabetic; Hypoglycemia; False allegations; Blood sugar level; Insulin; Custodial medicine Go to The announcement on 17th August 2015 by Diabetes UK of the 60% increase of diabetes in the last ten years, mainly (90%) Type 2 and linked to poor diet with high sugar levels and consequent obesity, is of concern. The cost in terms of morbidity and mortality, as well as financial, is huge accounting for 10% of the £10 billion NHS expenditure on diabetes being spent on medication alone. Vascular complications from diabetes result in 135 foot amputations every week. Recent figures for the UK show that two thirds of all adults were overweight with a quarter being clinically obese and that on in 12 British adults now has diabetes. In 2015 more than 120,000 patients were newly diagnosed with diabetes [1]. This rise is also reflected in those members of the general public that find themselves in police custody, although that may be a conservative figure given that those who find themselves in custody are more often that not those in the lower income brackets and who tend to eat fast foods with a high sugar content. There is also of course the unknown number of people who have diabetes, but have yet to be diagnosed.Although admittedly anecdotal, it is a well accepted premise, that prisoners in any form of custodial situation and when in a medical consultation with a doctor or nurse, may well declare illnesses that do not exist, exaggerate those that do or allege symptoms and conditions that are false, along with a past medical history that is both confused and/or deliberately untrue. There has been a number of papers published dealing with the medical and mental assessment of police detainees, their clinical care and medication [2-4]. It is then a regrettable fact that doctors working with such patients in a custodial milieu should be very cautious about accepting patient information given by detainees at face value. Information and awareness about diabetes is increasing in the general population and subsequent GP visits, as mentioned earlier, have resulted in the recent rise in the diagnosis of all types of this illness in the UK. Conversely it is often misperceived, and thus sometimes falsely declared by prisoners, as a dangerous illness, which, if handled sensibly, it is not. If diabetes is declared the doctor should always suggest that the patient consent to a base line capillary blood sugar level at the initial consultation and again subsequently to show a pattern or of if treatment is clinically indicated. Any suggestionof treatment with tablets or insulin without doing a blood sugaris clearly negligent either way. In such circumstances the use ofa medical template as an aide-memoire is often very helpful [5].The usual clinical targets for diabetics is to aim for the range of anon-diabetic. These are blood sugar levels two hours after foodof 3.9 – 8.0 mmol/L and levels before food of 3.5 – 5.5 mmol/L.However, used here as a rule of thumb in custodial situations, a""normal"" range of 4.0 mmol/L to 10.0 mmol/L has been appliedfor those fit to detain.Case I: As mentioned earlier, forensic medical examiners who takeall they are told at face value do themselves no favours and mayrisk their patient's well-being if they treat them on this basisduring such consultations. The philosopher's ""middle way"" isthe best approach; write everything down and then decide onclinical signs and clinical history what is or may be credible. Inthe case of declared diabetes; the patient being offered a capillaryblood test to allow a reasoned clinical decision to be made inrelation to management and treatment if required. Responsesto clinical questions on their diabetes such as: ""Insulin-insulin"",""10mls twice a day ""or"" the nurse does all my injections"" areunlikely to impress and have all been heard. The occasionaloutright refusal to allow a blood test does not necessarily meanthey are not diabetic, but is suggestive of this being the case.The excuse of a needle allergy, when it is of course a phobia notan allergy, is common, but noting tattoos or body piercings andthen commenting on this makes this less likely to be pursued.It is dangerous, however, to discount the possibility entirely;in clinical medicine never say never and never say always. Theimportance of the initial base line figure, when time and dateare recorded in the custody record, is that this allows sequentialmonitoring by following colleagues of the blood sugar in a casewhen a true diabetic just happened to have a blood sugar inthe normal range at that time. Some doctors do not record theblood sugar in the custody record on the grounds of patientconfidentiality; this is misinterpretation of ethics, unhelpfuland foolish. Persistent normal levels over several hours, whenmeasured and recorded in the custody record by subsequentduty doctors, often persuades the patient to admit that he orshe is not diabetic. One detainee gave an excellent history andvery believable insulin figures, but when later challenged overrepeated normal blood sugars admitted he was not diabetic, butthat his mother was and he regularly helped her as she had verypoor eye-sight. Such a history is a very dangerous thing to allegewith the risk of being believed and then of accepting treatmentrather than admit lying or in the hope of being hospitalised. Thescenario of becoming unconscious for another reason and thenbeing mismanaged, on the basis of the history given, is evenworse. For one prisoner the good news was that he was not aninsulin dependent diabetic; the bad news that he would not begoing to hospital, as he has angrily and volubly demanded, witha chance of escape. In the end it is all about the patient's safety in custody.Apart from their diabetes, medication that they may havebeen prescribed for other conditions is often taken in a poorlycompliant manner; when they remember or can be botheredor not at all. It is of vital importance to ask when they last tookany medication as this may have been weeks, even monthsago even though they will have told you they are ""on it"". Suchcustodial patients may also be abusing a variety of illegal drugsincluding heroin, crack and cannabis. The effects on metabolicrate of these depressants and stimulants can be considerableand clinical histories are sometimes bizarre. Often heroin andcrack are abused together either as a 50-50 melange ""speed ball""if injected or as a ""snowball"" if smoked which further confusesmatters rather than evening things out. The concomitant use ofalcohol, often including a dependency, is also a problem. Thecurrent use of the word ""issue"" instead of ""problem"" is bizarreand unhelpful. Alcohol, though itself a body carbohydrate load,requires energy to be metabolised and excess alcohol may infact lower the available blood sugar. The smell of ketones onthe breath of a hypoglycaemic insulin dependent diabetic maybe mistaken for the smell of ethanol, when in conjunction withapparently intoxicated behaviour. If missed this may well resultin tragically fatal results and a death in custody when they areput back in a cell to ""sober up"".This has been the experience of the author, but thankfullywithout the death, when an elderly IDD insisted that he was notdiabetic and refused to have a blood test. A blood test, takenwithout his consent, revealed a blood sugar of 2.2mmol/L. Thisdecision, though technically in law a common assault by theauthor, proved both life saving for the patient and professionsaving for the FME. When given sugar orally and his blood sugarlevel had returned to normal, the patient denied all memory ofthe conversation and could not understand why he had deniedbeing diabetic. In retrospect this was most probably a state ofincipient delirium prior to him losing consciousness as his bloodsugar became critical. Conversely a genuine IDD, who had beensuitably and fully assessed by the author feigned injecting hisinsulin and managed, unseen, to squirt it on the wall instead. Hethen demanded, not unreasonably, to be fed saying he was veryhungry and ended up in hospital for three days to be sorted out,this being exactly what he had wanted. Following these incidentsa review of the blood sugar levels of all patients seen over a fouryear period, who had declared themselves to be diabetic, wasdone (Figures 1-4). This was for ad hoc FME duty periods of06:30 to 18:30 hours between the 27th May 2011 to 26th May2015. Since the Glucometer used has a memory and applies timeand date stamps this was possible. Go to The two samples of white sugar from each source wereweighed unopened on a set of Fuzion FZ-350 electronic scales[6] bought by the author from the somewhat bemused ownerof the local ""bong-shop"" or ""head shop"" in Brixton, where drugsparaphernalia are sold. The average weight for all the sample sachets of white sugar was 2.84 grams with Costa, Whole Foodsand Prêt having the best regularity in weight. Perhaps it is alsonow high time for any suppliers of these sugar portions to givethe weight in grams on the packaging? This should also be thecase for all Airline sugar packs, so that when the tannoy call goesout for a physician to assist during an in-flight medical crisis,he or she is aware of the amounts and can calculate accordinglyfor treating a diabetic hypoglycaemia. On a recent Swissair flightthe author was provided with both straws (5.2gm and 5.0gm)and sachets (4.4gm and 4.5gm); the respective weights beingascertained on returning home.All measurements were done using a Bayer Contour-USBblood glucose meter with Bayer Contour® test strips [7] TheContour® meter provides a quantitative measurement ofglucose in a drop of blood from 0.6 mmol/L to 33.3 mmol/Land with a mini LCD display is default programmed to visuallysuggests seeking medical assistance if below 2.8 mmol/L orabove 13.9 mmol/L. The reading is based on measuring theelectrical current produced by the reaction of glucose withFAD glucose dehydrogenase and potassium ferricyanide; theelectrical current produced being proportionate to the amountof glucose present in the measured capillary sample. The meter,with a USB connection, has the advantage of being programmableon a PC, with default settings being able to be changed and isrechargeable at the same time. It also allows a number of extrabits of information to be keyed in when capillary blood sugarlevel is measured. The excellent internal program on Java scriptalso automatically produced the four detailed charts used toillustrate this paper. The price of the test strips are £25.00 for50, giving a 50p cost each time.It should always be remembered that a low blood sugar ismore critical than a high blood sugar and the author has seenpatients with levels of 30 mmol/L and above who had no idea,until told, that their levels were that high. In the absence of aGlucometer or when having run out of test strips or the machinedoes not work and a diabetic patient has said that they: ""don'tfeel very clever"" and is clearly unwell, then giving some sugarwhilst waiting for an ambulance is a sensible and possibly lifesavingdecision. Some doctors use the ""Rule of 15"" when treatinghypoglycaemia, but I do not advocate it for reasons of the delay.The old-style ""sliding scale"" is often the best and the one usedhere, but as a clinical decision it is that of the treating physician,albeit after discussion with the patient who will often, aftermany years, knows a great deal about their own diabetes and, if honest and sensible, can do much to help manage their illnessduring a difficult and stressful period.With the closure of many police station canteens andthe current, and probably continued absence, presumablyfor financial reasons, of the old Metropolitan Police CateringServices white sugar pack (3.8gm) as a measured and easilyavailable source of sugar, the author has found the portions or""straws"" of sugar available at the many UK High Street coffeeshops invaluable to have in a jacket pocket; but never, of course,stored with the Glucometer. White sugar contains 3.96 caloriesper gram and has a very consistent granule size whilst brownsugar has a higher water content and contains 3.73 calories pergram and the granules tend to be a little smaller in size. Thusgram for gram, white sugar has more calories, but measure formeasure, brown sugar will have more calories. Only white sugarwas used in this study and was given by the sublingual routewith the inevitable dissolved portion being gradually swallowed.(Table 1)With sublingual administration the sugar is in contact withthe mucous membrane under the tongue and diffuses through it.The connective tissue under the epithelium contains a profusionof capillaries; the sugar diffuses into them and rapidly enters thevenous circulation. It is thus direct, rapid and is unaltered bythe enzymes present in the saliva (the sero-mucous saliva fromthe sub mandibular glands being stimulated by the presenceof the sugar) before entering the blood stream and becomingavailable for use. Conversely sugar absorbed in the intestines ismuch delayed and subject to first-pass metabolism in the liverbefore becoming available in the general circulation. The singlewhite sugar portions were obtained from Greggs, AMT, Costa,Nero, Waitrose, Prêt, McCafé and Whole Foods and survey of theweights in grams of ""straws"" available is seen in the chart below: Go to How much will one gram of refined white sugar raise theblood sugar of a non-diabetic? Well, it depends on weight, sinceweight is part fluid volume. If they weigh, in these modern timesthe now near mythical 64 kilos or 140lbs, then one gram willraise it by around 0.22 mmol/L; if they weigh twice that much, itwill only raise it half as much and vice versa if they weigh 32kilosor 70lbs. The maths of dilution remains the same though BMIsof most of our patients have risen considerably. The 64 kilo/140pound insulin dependent diabetic needing urgent treatment forhypoglycaemia has an ""advantage"" as they are not producinginsulin and cannot offset the added glucose. So 1 gram of sugarwill raise their blood sugar by about 0.22 mmol/L regardlessof what their blood sugar was before. Treatment with glucagoninjection is available in the medical cabinet at all UK Met policecustody suites if the detainee is unconscious, but speed may beof the essence and sugar is much simpler answer whilst awaitingthe ambulance. If of course, they are still conscious and capableof cooperation. The need for them to go to A&amp;E once their bloodsugar level is reasonable remains debatable, but today's doctorshave become so risk averse, especially in custodial medicine,that such transfers are becoming almost inevitable. Go to This showed that over a four year period 65% of those testedhad a blood sugar within the normal range with 4% being belowtarget and 31% being above the target range. It is interesting tonote that in the first year 24 blood glucose levels were measuredof which 58% were in target:; in the 2nd year 27 of which 70%were in target, in the 3rd year 55 of which 65% were in targetand in the last year 88 of which again 65% were in target. Therehas been a marked increase in the numbers of diabetics in thegeneral population, most probably due to the increase in obesityand this appears to be mirrored in the custodial populationespecially over the last two years when in year three it doubledand then when it increased again by 60 % in year four. Howeverthe percentage of in target blood levels did not increase and infact, pro rata, has therefore decreased in the last year. Go to All the patients had declared themselves to be diabetic,hence the measurement of an initial blood sugar. A larger andmore complex met-analysis could be done relating also toage, sex, time, insulin dependence, tablet dependence or dietcontrolled, but in this initial study the question of initial andconsequent blood sugar levels, following police arrest of analleged diabetic, was all that was considered. This showed that65% of the patients presenting as self-declared diabetics hada normal blood sugar at their first custodial assessment. Thecaveat should still remain that this measurement should berepeated after a suitable time to attempt confirm or deny theinitial information and allowing treatment and monitoring ifabnormal. In the past we often worried more about diabetics;perhaps after viewing these results those concerns shouldbe more concentrated on the increasing numbers of alcoholdependent detainees withdrawing whilst in custody and therisks of fitting and possible death.

11 Reasons Why Berries Are Among the Healthiest Foods on Earth,"By Franziska Spritzler, RD, CDEBerries are among the healthiest foods you can eat.They're delicious, nutritious, and provide a number of impressive health benefits.Here are 11 good reasons to include berries in your diet. 1. Loaded With Antioxidants Berries contain antioxidants, which help keep free radicals under control.Free radicals are unstable molecules that are beneficial in small amounts but can damage your cells when their numbers get too high, causing oxidative stress (1).Berries are a great source of antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol. In addition to protecting your cells, these plant compounds may reduce disease risk (2, 3).One study showed that blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries have the highest antioxidant activity of commonly consumed fruits, next to pomegranates (4).In fact, several studies have confirmed that the antioxidants in berries may help reduce oxidative stress (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).One study in healthy men found that consuming a single, 10-ounce (300-gram) portion of blueberries helped protect their DNA against free radical damage (8).In another study in healthy people, eating 17 ounces (500 grams) of strawberry pulp every day for 30 days decreased a pro-oxidant marker by 38% (9).SummaryBerries are high in antioxidants like anthocyanins, which may protect your cells from free radical damage. 2. May Help Improve Blood Sugar and Insulin Response Berries may improve your blood sugar and insulin levels.Test-tube and human studies suggest that they may protect your cells from high blood sugar levels, help increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce blood sugar and insulin response to high-carb meals (10, 11, 12, 13).Importantly, these effects appear to occur in both healthy people and those with insulin resistance.In one study in healthy women, eating 5 ounces (150 grams) of puréed strawberries or mixed berries with bread led to a 24–26% reduction in insulin levels, compared to consuming the bread alone (13).Moreover, in a six-week study, obese people with insulin resistance who drank a blueberry smoothie twice per day experienced greater improvements in insulin sensitivity than those who consumed berry-free smoothies (14).SummaryBerries may improve blood sugar and insulin response when consumed with high-carb foods or included in smoothies. 3. High in Fiber Berries are a good source of fiber, including soluble fiber. Studies show that consuming soluble fiber slows down the movement of food through your digestive tract, leading to reduced hunger and increased feelings of fullness.This may decrease your calorie intake and make weight management easier (15, 16).What's more, fiber helps reduce the number of calories you absorb from mixed meals. One study found that doubling your fiber intake could make you absorb up to 130 fewer calories per day (17).In addition, the high fiber content of berries means that they're low in digestible or net carbs, which are calculated by subtracting fiber from total carbs.Here are the carb and fiber counts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of berries (18, 19, 20, 21):Raspberries: 11.9 grams of carbs, 6.5 of which are fiberBlackberries: 10.2 grams of carbs, 5.3 of which are fiberStrawberries: 7.7 grams of carbs, 2.0 of which are fiberBlueberries: 14.5 grams of carbs, 2.4 of which are fiberNote that a typical serving size for berries is 1 cup, which converts to about 4.4–5.3 ounces (125–150 grams) depending on the type.Because of their low net carb content, berries are a low-carb-friendly food.SummaryBerries contain fiber, which may increase feelings of fullness, as well as reduce appetite and the number of calories your body absorbs from mixed meals. 4. Provide Many Nutrients Berries are low in calories and extremely nutritious. In addition to being high in antioxidants, they also contain several vitamins and minerals.Berries, especially strawberries, are high in vitamin C. In fact, 1 cup (150 grams) of strawberries provides a whopping 150% of the RDI for vitamin C (20).With the exception of vitamin C, all berries are fairly similar in terms of their vitamin and mineral content.Below is the nutrition content of a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of blackberries (19):Calories: 43Vitamin C: 35% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)Manganese: 32% of the RDIVitamin K1: 25% of the RDICopper: 8% of the RDIFolate: 6% of the RDIThe calorie count for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of berries ranges from 32 for strawberries to 57 for blueberries, making berries some of the lowest-calorie fruits around (20, 21).SummaryBerries are low in calories yet rich in several vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C and manganese. 5. Help Fight Inflammation Berries have strong anti-inflammatory properties.Inflammation is your body's defense against infection or injury.However, modern lifestyles often lead to excessive, long-term inflammation due to increased stress, inadequate physical activity, and unhealthy food choices.This type of chronic inflammation is believed to contribute to conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity (22, 23, 24).Studies suggest that the antioxidants in berries may help lower inflammatory markers (25, 26, 27, 28).In one study in overweight people, those drinking a strawberry beverage with a high-carb, high-fat meal noticed a more significant decrease in certain inflammatory markers than the control group (28).SummaryBerries may help reduce inflammation and decrease your risk of heart disease and other health problems. 6. May Help Lower Cholesterol Levels Berries are a heart-healthy food.Black raspberries and strawberries have been shown to help lower cholesterol in people who are obese or have metabolic syndrome (29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34).In an 8-week study, adults with metabolic syndrome who consumed a beverage made from freeze-dried strawberries daily experienced an 11% drop in LDL (bad) cholesterol (31).What's more, berries may help prevent LDL cholesterol from becoming oxidized or damaged, which is believed to be a major risk factor for heart disease (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37).In a controlled study in obese people, those eating 1.5 ounces (50 grams) of freeze-dried blueberries for 8 weeks noticed a 28% reduction in their oxidized LDL levels (37).SummaryBerries have been shown to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and help protect it from becoming oxidized, which may reduce your risk of heart disease. 7. May Be Good for Your Skin Berries may help reduce skin wrinkling, as their antioxidants help control free radicals, one of the leading causes of skin damage that contributes to aging (38).Though research is limited, ellagic acid appears responsible for some of the skin-related benefits of berries.Test-tube and animal studies suggest that this antioxidant may protect skin by blocking the production of enzymes that break down collagen in sun-damaged skin (39, 40, 41).Collagen is a protein that is part of your skin's structure. It allows your skin to stretch and remain firm. When collagen is damaged, your skin may sag and develop wrinkles.In one study, applying ellagic acid to the skin of hairless mice exposed to ultraviolet light for eight weeks decreased inflammation and helped protect collagen from damage (41).SummaryBerries contain the antioxidant ellagic acid, which may help decrease wrinkling and other signs of skin aging related to sun exposure. 8. May Help Protect Against Cancer Several antioxidants in berries, including anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol, may reduce cancer risk (42, 43, 44).Specifically, animal and human studies suggest that berries may protect against cancer of the esophagus, mouth, breast, and colon (45, 46, 47, 48, 49).In a study in 20 people with colon cancer, eating 2 ounces (60 grams) of freeze-dried raspberries for 1–9 weeks improved tumor markers in some participants, though not all (49).Another test-tube study found that all types of strawberries had strong, protective effects on liver cancer cells, regardless of whether they were high or low in antioxidants (50).SummaryBerries have been shown to reduce markers associated with tumor growth in animals and people with several types of cancer. 9. Can Be Enjoyed on Nearly All Types of Diets Berries can be included in many kinds of diets.Though people on low-carb and ketogenic diets often avoid fruit, you can usually enjoy berries in moderation.For example, a half-cup serving of blackberries (70 grams) or raspberries (60 grams) contains less than 4 grams of digestible carbs (18, 19).Liberal amounts of berries can be incorporated into paleo, Mediterranean, vegetarian, and vegan diets.For people who want to lose weight, the few calories in berries make them ideal to include in meals, snacks, or desserts.Organic and wild berries are now widely available in many parts of the world. When they're not in season, frozen berries can be purchased and thawed as needed.The only people who need to avoid berries are those who require a low-fiber diet for certain digestive disorders, as well as individuals who are allergic to berries. Allergic reactions to strawberries are most common.SummaryBerries can be enjoyed on most diets, as they're low in calories and carbs and widely available fresh or frozen. 10. May Help Keep Your Arteries Healthy In addition to lowering cholesterol, berries provide other benefits for heart health, including improving the function of your arteries.The cells that line your blood vessels are called endothelial cells. They help control blood pressure, keep blood from clotting, and perform other important functions.Excessive inflammation can damage these cells, inhibiting proper function. This is referred to as endothelial dysfunction, a major risk factor for heart disease (51).Berries have been found to improve endothelial function in studies in healthy adults, individuals with metabolic syndrome, and people who smoke (29, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56).In a controlled study in 44 people with metabolic syndrome, those consuming a daily blueberry smoothie showed significant improvements in endothelial function, compared to the control group (56).Though fresh berries are considered healthiest, berries in processed form may still provide some heart-healthy benefits. Baked berry products are considered processed, whereas freeze-dried berries are not.One study found that although baking blueberries reduced their anthocyanin content, total antioxidant concentrations remained the same. Arterial function improved similarly in people who consumed baked or freeze-dried berries (57).SummaryBerries have been found to improve arterial function in several studies in healthy people, those with metabolic syndrome, and people who smoke. 11. Delicious Alone or in Healthy Recipes Berries are undeniably delicious. They make a wonderful snack or dessert, whether you use one type or a mix of two or more.Though they're naturally sweet and require no additional sweetener, adding a bit of heavy or whipped cream can transform them into a more elegant dessert.For breakfast, try berries topped with either plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or ricotta cheese, along with some chopped nuts.Another way to include berries in your diet is as part of a salad.To discover the nearly endless versatility of berries, browse the internet for healthy recipes.SummaryBerries are delicious when served alone, with cream, or in healthy recipes. The Bottom Line Berries taste great, are highly nutritious, and provide many health benefits, including for your heart and skin.By including them in your diet on a regular basis, you can improve your overall health in a very enjoyable way.

Amazon Alexa Launches its First HIPAA-Compliant Medical Skills,"The multitrillion-dollar health care industry is one hell of a market, especially with well over 70 million baby boomers hitting an age when health care is a necessity, not to mention 80 million millennials who are finally getting around to having kids. So, it makes sense that Amazon, which has been investing heavily in experimental health care projects and trials of its signature smart speaker in hospitals, would start creating HIPAA-compliant medical skills for its voice assistant, Alexa.HIPAA stands for the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which has two main purposes: First, to provide continuous health insurance coverage for workers who lose or change their jobs and, more importantly to Amazon, to standardize the electronic transmission of administrative and financial transactions.Amazon ran a trial of smart speakers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the last year, acquired online pharmacy PillPack for millions of dollars, and commanded its flagship division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to expand its HIPAA-compliant abilities.There are some hurdles for companies to jump through to get on Alexa's health care platform, but a bunch of big companies have a huge start. Amazon launched a site that enables companies to describe the health care skills they have in mind, giving Amazon a platform by which to vet the developers who want to apply to the program.The program has launched with six new Alexa health care skills from major providers, payors, pharmacy benefit managers, and digital health coaching companies. The biggest is probably Cigna Health, whose users can command Alexa to ask Cigna Health Today for a daily tip.""With our industry-leading voice skills, we are meeting customers where they are — in their homes, in their cars — and making it simpler to create healthier habits and daily routines. Through our Amazon Alexa skill, customers can simply use voice to understand the full range of their health benefits and receive personalized wellness incentives for meeting their health goals, empowering them to take control of their total health,"" said Stephen Cassell, senior vice president of Global Brand and Customer Communications for Cigna in Amazon's release.Other commands include the ability to ask Express Scripts where your order is, schedule an urgent care appointment with Swedish Health, book an appointment in the Carolinas with Atrium Health, or check blood sugar results with Livongo.",https://t.co/e7TZ781vVj,others

Burn Carbs and Lower Blood Sugar with Turmeric- Thomas DeLauer,"Burn Carbs and Lower Blood Sugar with Turmeric- Thomas DeLauer: The trick is to know when to utilize specific foods, and in this case, a specific spice. Turmeric has so many properties, but its carb control properties are amazing! http://www.thomasdelauer.comFat loss is simple - in order to lose fat, you need to learn to control your insulin levels. Your pancreas releases insulin when you eat, and even larger quantities of insulin are released when you have a carb-heavy meal. This happens because carbs are converted to sugars in your blood, and the insulin is needed to control your blood sugar. When you snack consistently and eat a lot of carb heavy foods, your pancreas does not have the time it needs to rebuild insulin for your next meal. Insulin remains in your blood for about 2-3 hours after a meal, and if you eat lots of carbs your pancreas never has a break from working to produce more insulin. Over time this leads to the pancreas not being able to release sufficient insulin, which can lead to type-2 diabetes.Glucagon and insulin: glucagon and insulin work together in a balancing act. When blood sugar levels drop, glucagon tells the liver to release stored glucose to maintain blood sugar levels. This is when fatty acids and ketone bodies are released, which equals fat burning. Insulin and glucagon cannot be present at the same time, so if we are consuming lots of carbs and always eating we always have insulin in our blood, and glucagon doesn't have the chance to kick start fat burning. So, consuming carbs leads to a higher insulin release, hampering fat loss and eventually leading to type-2 diabetes. What can you do?Snack less and eat fewer carbs, allowing your insulin levels to drop. You can also add turmeric into your diet. Traditionally used in Chinese medicine Asian cuisine, turmeric has been utilized for many years. Recently the blood sugar lowering effects of turmeric have been found in studies.A 2008 study published in Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research found that both mice with diabetes and those without experienced lower blood glucose levels when curcumin was added to their diets for 6 weeks. When you lower your blood sugar you thus lower your blood insulin levels, allowing glucagon to get your fat burning mode started. Simply add turmeric to your meals to reduce your blood sugar levels and thus the amount of insulin released after your meals. Combine this with eating fewer carbs and you can help to control insulin, allowing for fat loss.1. Carbohydrates and Blood Sugarhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritio... 2.

Control Your Sugar Level Now,"Diabetes is a metabolic condition, which is characterized by pathological changes with regard to insulin metabolism and blood sugar levels. All over the world, there are millions of people who suffer from this chronic disorder, requiring permanent treatment (often in the form of insulin shots). There are several types of diabetes, each with its own manifestations, but all require careful monitoring of blood sugar levels and adequate management/treatment.Main diabetes types – type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetesType 1, also known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune condition. What happens is that the overactive immune system attacks the pancreas, affecting insulin production. This causes people to become dependent on artificial insulin. Type 2, more commonly referred to as diabetes mellitus, affects the use of insulin by the body. Insulin is produced in a normal manner but the body develops resistance to it, causing high blood sugar levels. This is the most common type of diabetes and it is often diagnosed in obese people.Gestational diabetes, as the name clearly expresses it, occurs during pregnancy. The placenta produces insulin-blocking hormones, reducing the body's sensitivity to insulin and leading to increased blood sugar levels. The condition must be carefully monitored but it usually resolves after birth. What are the symptoms of diabetes?A person who suffers from diabetes might present increased hunger and thirst, as well as feel easily fatigued or dizzy. Weight loss can occur, accompanied by the need to urinate frequently and a blurry vision. One can also have lesions that heal with difficulty. Additional symptoms can be present in accordance with each gender. For example, women might suffer from dry and itchy skin, as well as recurrent infections (such as those affecting the urinary tract; also, yeast infections are common). Men might suffer from erectile dysfunction and low libido, as well as have reduced strength in their muscles. What are the causes of diabetes?There is no known cause behind the appearance of type 1 diabetes. Suspected causes include the genetic predisposition and viral infections, the latter causing the immune system to become overactive. As for type 2 diabetes, it can be passed from one generation to the other, but there are lifestyle factors contributing to its appearance. For example, obesity – especially concentrated in the abdominal area – increases the risk of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is clearly caused by the hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. In discussing the diagnosis of diabetes, one must make mention of various risk factors. Apart from obesity and having a family history, potential risk factors include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, age (over 45 years), leading a sedentary lifestyle and having been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Pre-existent conditions, such as the polycystic ovary syndrome and even one's race can increase the risk of diabetes (for example, African Americans present a higher risk of developing this condition). Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes can give birth prematurely and even the baby might present the risk of developing diabetes later on in life.ComplicationsDiabetes can lead to life-threatening complications, such as stroke and heart disease. Other complications include diabetic neuropathy, loss of eyesight, and kidney failure.Management and treatment of diabetesInsulin administrationInsulin shots are the standard management solution for type 1 diabetes. Depending on one's need, these can have an effect that ranges from rapid to long acting. One must constantly monitor the blood sugar level and watch out for physical symptoms that might indicate the need for a new dose. Insulin shots can lead to side-effects, such as nausea, profuse sweating or shaking. Medication The medication plan for type-2 diabetes can include specific drugs to lower the blood sugar levels and ensure the effective usage of insulin. Commonly prescribed drugs include metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors. Exercise and dietType-2 diabetes can be kept under control with the help of lifestyle changes. One must lose excess weight and follow a diet rich in fresh and nutritious foods. Eating at fixed intervals is encouraged. High-sugar foods must be avoided, as well as alcohol. Physical exercise is encouraged but one must pay attention to the signs of low blood pressure (such as dizziness or confusion).Diabetes and mood swingsSuffering from a chronic condition such as diabetes can lead to mood swings, as well as anxiety and depression. As the blood sugar fluctuates, one might feel nervous and stressed. It is important to recognize these problems and get help; for example, one can opt for cognitive behavioral therapy and counseling. You can use the Care Clinic's health app as a mood tracker and record your emotional symptoms, identifying a connection between these and your blood sugar levels. The application can also be useful in managing other aspects related to your condition. For instance, you can record your treatment plan and set up medication reminders, making sure you are getting your shots at fixed intervals. A health diary can also be useful in keeping track of blood sugar levels and also to record the results of different tests.",https://t.co/5S8ZYeVXhD,others

"Kidney Beans Health Benefits: Weight Loss, Cancer Prevention And More","Kidney beans are native legumes mainly found in Central America and Mexico that are rich in nutrients like fiber, which promotes better digestion, among other things. Check out the different health benefits kidney beans have to offer.Weight LossObesity causes major health problems and is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases. Following a healthy diet helps you prevent obesity and ensures weight loss. Kidney beans are among the essential ingredients that can help you achieve this goal.A study published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine claimed that obese adults who were recommended to eat beans four times a week as a part of their healthy diet lost significant weight. Those who were not eating the plant-based food lost the weight longer than those who ate legumes.Below are the different health benefits kidney beans can offer.Prevent CancerKidney beans are rich in fiber and have a very low glycemic index (GI). The latter is a method that measures how the food you eat affects the rise of blood sugar levels after every meal. Bean starch is more beneficial to the body than other high-carb foods.Kidney beans contain starch that aids in weight management. Its alpha-galactosides and the starch content act as prebiotics that move from your digestive tract to your colon. There, they are fermented by healthy bacteria. The result thereof forms short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, propionate and acetate that improve colon health and prevent cancer.Regulate Blood SugarHigh blood sugar levels increase your risk of heart disease. As per Healthline, beans are better at controlling blood sugar than most dietary sources of carbohydrates such as broccoli. Observational studies also confirmed that eating beans which are low-glycemic foods reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes that results from high blood sugar levels. Thus, eating kidney beans that have low-glycemic content improves your body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels, which is very helpful for people suffering from type 2 diabetes.Dietary TipsRaw beans are high in a toxic protein called phytohaemagglutinin, which is more potent in kidney beans. Experts advise that we should soak the beans in water before cooking or eating them. This eliminates the toxin, making it healthier and safer to eat.",https://t.co/Ycyl8ncpAi,others
Glycated Hemoglobin HbA1c,"Protein Description 3B75Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a derivative compound that results when Hemoglobin (Hb) is exposed to high levels of blood sugar for prolonged periods of time. Sugar is extremely cytotoxic and readily binds to proteins throughout the body. Glycosylation causes structural changes in the protein, preventing Hemoglobin from achieving optimal 3D conformation and biochemical function.Protein LocationHemoglobin the most abundant protein inside red blood cells and transporter oxygen molecules throughout the body. Red blood cells aren't the only location we find Hemoglobin in nature. Various forms of Hemoglobin can be found throughout the body performing various functions other than transporting oxygen. Hemoglobin can even be found in plants, and even legumes. In plants, oxygen molecules can break down molecular function of some proteins. Hemoglobin works to protect these molecular machines by savaging for oxygen, preventing damage.Protein StructureHemoglobin is a relatively large protein, it's reported resolution is 2.1 Å. Composed of four protein chains, 2 Alpha chains and 2 Beta chains, each chain has a single ring-like HEME Group (red x 4) with a single iron atom in its core. Attached across its surface are glucose and fructose molecules that bind to multiple residues across the protein's surface.Hemoglobin AnatomyStructureResiduesAtomsChain α1411069 (x 2)Chain ß1461123 (x 2)HEME Group143 (x 4)Oxygen12 (x 4)Glucose112 (x 16)Glycated Hemoglobin A1cHemoglobin makes for an ideal target to determine long-term exposure to elevated levels of glucose, because Hemoglobin is easily drawn from the body in blood samples. When the blood stream is saturated with too much sugar, hemoglobin begins to accumulate sugar particles on its surface. Hemoglobin is a strong and robust protein, but even it suffers marginally because of sugar accumulation. To our scientific advantage, the accumulation of sugar on hemoglobin can be measured. From this measurement, we gain insightsThe Hemoglobin A1c Diabetes Blood TestWhen sugar binds to hemoglobin, it's a permanent bond that doesn't break. This means that as long as that particle of Hemoglobin is still circulating in that blood cell, hemoglobin collects more sugar. Because red blood cell's lifespan is only about 3 months, the Glycated Hemoglobin A1c test is a great snapshot of blood glucose control for the last 3 months.By simplifying a complex biochemical process, the material interactions of the model relayed intuitively the dangers of high blood sugar, while the educator relayed positive self-management practices.The Glycated Hemoglobin HbA1c blood test, or more commonly known as the ""A1c"" blood test, is an important test given to people around the world, many of those at risk of developing diabetes. The test is the universally preferred method of diagnosing the onset of type 2 pre-diabetes and the only blood test that does not need overnight fasting. Achieving improved A1C scores is an important milestone in lifestyle intervention programs focused on reversing pre-diabetes.Photos of the Interactive Glycated Hemoglobin HbA1cAs important as this blood test is, the A1C blood test is universally misunderstood; too often confused with acute blood sugar readings. The Interactive Hemoglobin A1C protein model solves this problem by transforming a misunderstood blood test result into an interactive scientific experience. The interactive model simulates the glycosylation of hemoglobin using magnets to bind glucose (blue) directly to the model surface.Explaining the A1c Test to Kids Living with Type 1 DiabetesShortly after completing the design and fabrication of the Hemoglobin A1c Teaching Model, we tested the effectiveness of using it to teach children living with type 1 and 2 diabetes about the HbA1c test. The goal of the experiment was to explain to children the importance of checking their blood glucose regularly, explain what the HbA1c blood test analyses, and how prolonged exposure to glucose causes high HbA1c scores. We contacted the Diabetes Youth Foundation of Indiana to see if they'd like to try using our model during their yearly summer camp retreat.HbA1c Model questionnaire taken by children at diabetes summer campFour age groups of children were introduced to the model during their a lecture explaining the HbA1c test. The children's diabetes educator used the magnetized pieces of glucose (blue) to show how sugar binds to proteins, letting the magnetic properties of the materials explain glycosylation. To represent increased HbA1c scores, the educator would attach more glucose pieces to the model. By simplifying a complex biochemical process, the material interactions of the model relayed intuitively the dangers of high blood sugar, while the educator relayed positive self-management practices. After the class, the children were asked to answer a few questions about the A1c test and the information they learned while playing with the model. The results were more than fantastic. The diabetes educator reported that every single child took away new information about the test and the importance of good blood glucose control.Model DescriptionsBiologic Models has a variety of Hemoglobin based models. In specific, we have two types of Glycated Hemoglobin A1c and Oxygenated Hemoglobin, each in different materials and sizes. Please see the description below to learn more about each product and functionality.Interactive Glycated Hemoglobin A1c Model (Acrylic Plastic)This model of Hemoglobin A1c is based on x-ray crystallography data sets: 1HHO, and 3B75. These models are cast by hand in high quality, durable and washable plastics. Model dimensions are 4in x 3cm x 3in. Each model comes with a custom made display base.3D Print Glycated Hemoglobin HbA1c and Oxygenated Hemoglobin Hb (Full-color Sandstone)These are the 3D printed protein models of Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) and Oxygenated Hemoglobin (Hb), created from PDB ID: 1HHO, and 3B75. The globulin chains (2x A,B) of this model are tinted shades of pink-white, HEME groups red, and Oxygen Molecules Blue. This model also visualizes the HbA1c diabetes blood test by showing how sugar molecules (cyan) attach to proteins. When compared to our normal Oxygenated Hemoglobin (Hb), healthcare educators and physicians can quickly explain both the HbA1c blood test and why it is so important for patients to control their blood glucose.",https://t.co/BOrFHbkhX1,others
Zenith Labs Blood Sugar Premier Review - Controlling Blood Sugar?,"Keeping our blood sugar levels in check is quite a challenging task. We not only have to watch what we eat, but also exercise regularly and stay away from sedentary habits. At the same time, we have to juggle a busy work schedule along with the stresses of modern life. Stress and unhealthy food are the two main culprits in knocking our blood sugar out of whack. However, it is these two aspects that are unavoidable in this day and age. Fortunately, though, science has given us a third-party support which may help us to control our blood sugar and possibly prevent disturbing conditions like diabetes. We're talking here about Zenith Labs' Blood Sugar Premier, the reputed company's offering for assisting with blood sugar issues.Read on to find out everything you need to know about the Blood Sugar Premier, its features, benefits, and usage.About the Blood Sugar PremierThe formula of the Blood Sugar Premier is based on a new discovery about Chinese medicine. This is known as the 'Old Testament"" of such practices. When used regularly, the Blood Sugar Premier could help people with blood sugar issues to handle their problems in a natural manner.The Blood Sugar Premier supplement is meant for supporting a balanced sugar level within our blood and also promoting healthy levels of insulin. We all know that when insulin gets out of control, all sort of problems like insulin resistance, diabetes, and PCOS come into play. Since none of us wants these health issues to be a part of our lives, we should consider taking the Blood Sugar Premier in order to help us control our internal systems.How the Blood Sugar Premier WorksThe Blood Sugar Premier works through a special and unique formula. As mentioned above, it's based on the ancient tradition of Chinese medicine. This is a practice that many people are looking towards as a way to avoid taking synthetic and possibly addictive conventional medicine. The Blood Sugar Premier hence takes its efficacy from ancient herbs such as piperine, curcumin, and berberine. When combined, these three ingredients give a potent and lasting trigger for supporting proper levels of blood sugar in our bodies. In addition to this, there are several other vitamins and herbs added that contribute to the powerful effect of the Blood Sugar Premier.Advantages of the Blood Sugar PremierThere are several reasons why we should start taking the Blood Sugar Premier, if only to try it out once. Some of these are mentioned below:– The support of balanced blood sugar could prevent us from contracting diabetes and its many negative symptoms. These include sugar crashes, weakness, joint pain, and even more dangerous effects. However, it must be kept in mind that the Blood Sugar Premier is not a substitute for diabetes medicine and should be taken after consulting our regular doctor.– The supplement promotes healthy levels of insulin. This would reduce insulin resistance, which is a symptom of PCOS and diabetes as well. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility among women, so the Blood Sugar Premier is providing a much needed service if it controls insulin resistance.– Taking the Blood Sugar Premier can help us lose weight and body fat as well. This is because mismanaged blood sugar levels and insulin resistance both contribute to weight gain and a resistance to weight loss. When these negative factors are dealt with, the body would soon start responding to a proper diet and exercise in the normal fashion.– Regular intake of the Blood Sugar Premier can help in enhancing overall mood and increasing energy levels. This would be a great boost, since sugar crashes and the effect of low blood sugar could make one feel weak and lethargic. Taking this supplement would hence enable us to get things done on time and enjoy our lives more. – The capsules of the Blood Sugar Premier are easy to take no matter where we are. All we have to do is take two capsules twice a day with water. We can even slip the bottle into our purse or pocket and take them to work or on a trip. The capsules can easily go into pill boxes with no fear of spoilage or leakage, as is the case with liquid or powder supplements.Ingredients of the Blood Sugar PremierIf we're going to place our trust in the Blood Sugar Premier we need to know about its three key ingredients. Fortunately, the official website for this supplement doesn't hold back on giving us information about them. It's hence worth looking at the following elements and briefly discussing these:– BerberineBerberine is mainly used for dealing with inflammation of the body cells. When taken regularly and in the right amounts, it can even break down the fatty deposits surrounding the pancreas. This would help the body to reset its blood sugar management system and proceed normally. Berberine is an extract derived from the Chinese Goldthread Plant, but there's no need to go out in search of it now. Zenith Labs has provided us with a convenient and modern formulation that's both easy and convenient to take.– CurcuminCurcumin is derived from nature turmeric root, which has many healing benefits in both Indian and Chinese herbal medicine. It's also helpful for dealing with harmful inflammation in the body, which is what usually causes blood sugar levels to go awry.– PiperineTurmeric needs something to help it absorb into the body and actually work its magic. otherwise, it would simply pass through without giving much benefit. For this purpose, Zenith Labs has added piperine into the mix of Blood Sugar Premier. Piperine is a black pepper molecule that can activate the curcumin when it's taken into the body. This has been tested and found to be beneficial for healthy insulin levels and the promotion of non-inflamed cells.How to Take the Blood Sugar PremierWe should take one capsule of the Blood Sugar Premier in the morning with our breakfast, and one in the evening with dinner. If our physician recommends a higher dose, as can be possible with overweight or extreme cases, the dose can be increased to four capsules a day.Buying the Blood Sugar PremierFortunately, the Blood Sugar Premier is available to us in three convenient packages. We can start off by trying just one bottle, which gives us a whole month's supply. Alternatively, we may get three bottles or six in one go. An individual bottle would cost much more when bought separately, though. Since buying the bottle in bulk is cheaper, we might get our friends in on the deal or stock up on the supplement once we've determined that it's right for us. We may save over $30 in this manner. Conclusion – Is Blood Sugar Premier Worth Trying?Blood sugar levels are no joke, so we should take all the help we can get in order to control them. While we should get a doctor's approval first, the Blood Sugar Premier certainly seems like a viable option. It's made up of natural ingredients with well-researched formulation. We don't know how long the supplies would last, though, so it's best if we visit the official website and place an order soon.

Diabetes Care Tips for Diabetes Management,"Health | Diabetes | June 12, 2018 | By Lisa Marie Conklin13 Pieces of Diabetes Advice Your Doctor Might Not Tell You 1. There is no one-size-fits-all dietIt would be nice if there were a magical, precise diet to follow that would keep blood sugar levels stable for everyone with diabetes—but no such luck. ""There is no perfect ratio of carbs, protein, fats for all people with diabetes,"" says Sarah Rettinger, MD, an endocrinologist at John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.Instead, Dr. Rettinger suggests a reasonable distribution of nutrients for each meal. ""One of my favorite ways to think about meal planning is using the 'plate method.' Envision a small plate filled with one-quarter complex carbohydrates, one quarter protein, and one-half low-carbohydrate vegetables."" If you're looking for a diet plan that's a little more structured, Dr. Rettinger recommends the Mediterranean Diet, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, or a plant-based diet as healthy choices for people with diabetes.This Is How to Follow the Mediterranean Diet, Explained in 2 Minutes2. Your heart may need special testsThis may be sobering, but it's important: ""People with diabetes usually don't die from blood sugar problems, most often they die from cardiovascular-related disease, which is why you need to focus not only on blood sugars, but also blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking,"" says Kellie Rodriguez, MSN, MBA, CDE, director of the Global Diabetes Program at the Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System in Dallas, Texas. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than people who don't have diabetes.Depending on your risk factors, your doctor might offer (or you could ask about getting) a baseline EKG as part of your initial diabetes care, suggests Luigi Meneghini, MD, MBA, executive director of the Global Diabetes Program at Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System and a professor of internal medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.""After that, cardiac testing is reserved for those that develop suspicious cardiac symptoms like chest pain, pressure, change in physical endurance, shortness of break with activities, etc,"" says Dr. Meneghini.3. You should know your BP and cholesterol levelsYou probably know your blood sugar or A1C readings cold, but your blood pressure should also be checked every three to six months during routine diabetes visits. (Here's more information on what your blood pressure numbers mean.) Your doctor will keep a close eye on cholesterol too. (Here's more info on what your cholesterol numbers mean.) ""Most people with diabetes over age 40 should take a statin drug, regardless of their cholesterol level, and should start a baby aspirin after the age of 50,"" says Dr. Meneghini. 4. Get up and move every 30 minutes or soIt's no secret exercise is an important part of managing diabetes, but it's not always enjoyable or easy to squeeze into your busy day. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recently issued updated recommendations and they are so much more doable. The ADA now recommends short periods of movement every 30 minutes. ""This stimulates the muscle to use a bit of glucose and reducing sedentary time is also linked to better heart health,"" says Jill Weisenberger, MS, RDN, CDE, author of Diabetes Weight Loss Week by Week.Set a timer if you need a reminder. You could keep some light weights handy by the sofa and crank out a few biceps curls or shoulder raises while watching TV. If you're at the office, walk to your coworker's desk instead of emailing, pace the room walk while you're on a conference call, or take a short walk after a meal. ""Every single time you exercise, you boost your insulin sensitivity,"" says Weisenberger.Exercise with Diabetes: 3 Workouts for Healthier Blood Sugar5. Swap saturated fat for unsaturated versionsFats generally don't have immediate effects on blood sugar levels, so we tend to focus more on carb choices, but being smart about dietary fat is critical for two reasons, Weisenberger says. ""First, your fat choices affect the health of your heart and blood vessels. Second, when diets have a lot of saturated and trans fats, insulin resistance worsens. It improves when unsaturated fats replace the less healthy fats.""Fill your grocery cart with unsaturated fat options like avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oils, peanut and canola oil, flaxseed, and fish. Leave the butter, lard, margarine and coconut oil on the grocery shelves.6. Don't starve yourself for blood sugar control""One of the biggest issues I see with patients with diabetes is putting off eating or eating too little at mealtime order to control their blood sugars,"" says diabetes educator Alison Pelz, RD, LD, LCSW, who has a private practice in Austin, Texas. ""While this may work for a while eventually your body's biology takes over and the drive to eat large amounts of food is strong."" The result: You could lose control and possibly binge eat, which will drive up blood sugars—and guilt—often resulting in repeating the whole feast-famine eating pattern again. ""What I recommend to patients is to eat regular meals—and snacks if hungry—throughout the day. These should include all macronutrients, including carbohydrate, protein, and fat,"" says Pelz. ""This leads to more consistent blood sugars, less overeating, and feeling more at peace with food."" Here are nutritionist-approved snacks for diabetes, as well as tips for eating carbs with diabetes and the best protein choices on a diabetes diet. 7. Stock up on a good moisturizerHigh blood glucose levels can cause dry skin because the body attempts to remove the extra glucose by increasing urination. Another factor is neuropathy, in which the damaged skin nerves can cause decreased sweating and contribute to dryness and cracking of the skin. Cracking and bleeding skin isn't just a nuisance—it can increase your risk of infection. Rodriguez recommends using fragrance-free, non-greasy cream or lotion on your skin after you shower. But don't use the moisturizer between your toes. ""They could remain moist and this could lead to fungal infections,"" says Rodriguez. Here's more info on picking the right moisturizer for dry skin. 8. Ditch your flip-flopsYou may have gotten the foot-care lecture at your doctor's office, but the importance of wearing proper-fitting shoes and taking good care of your feet can't be understated. One shoe you may want to avoid: flimsy flip-flops. They tend to bang against the sole of the foot while you walk, which dries and hardens the skin and can lead to cracks. They also leave most of your foot exposed compared with more supportive sandals, which can make it more likely you could stub your toe or experience other foot injuries.9. Don't use alcohol wipes before testing blood sugarAs for your hands, keep your hands and fingers from drying out by avoiding alcohol wipes to sanitize your skin before you test your blood sugar (unless there is no soap and water available). Besides drying the skin, you have to wait for the alcohol to dry before you check your glucose as wet alcohol will affect glucose readings. Here are other rules to follow for testing your blood sugar. 10. Insulin does not damage your pancreasMost people with diabetes begin treatment with antidiabetic pills, but if your doctor suggests insulin at some point, don't worry about myths about certain side effects. ""Insulin does not damage your own pancreas; if anything, it helps it rest and maybe even helps it make more insulin,"" says Dr. Meneghini. ""It does not damage your eyes, nerves or kidneys, but actually protects them by lowering your blood sugar, which is itself the cause of the damage.""11. You may need a different toothbrushing routineWhen you have diabetes it's harder to fight infections, and this can make you more prone to gum disease, cavities due to dry mouth, and slow wound healing. These oral health conditions cause inflammation, which can in turn affect blood sugar control and worsen the condition of your diabetes, says Scott Eisen, DDS, a dentist with Catonsville Dental Care in Catonsville, Maryland. ""A dentist may prescribe a high fluoride toothpaste, a saliva-substitute to help counteract the harmful effects of dry mouth, or an antibiotic to fight infection,"" says Dr. Eisen. Be sure your dentist knows about your current medications and management of your blood glucose. Maintain good oral hygiene (that means not skipping flossing and brushing twice a day) and keep your regularly scheduled dental cleaning appointments. 12. You need to see the eye doctor regularlyYou may have heard about diabetic retinopathy, a retinal disease that can lead to poor vision and even blindness, but you may not know there are ways to prevent or slow your risk of damaging your retina—if you act now. ""Damage usually happens slowly and is due to uncontrolled blood sugars from a few years ago, not because of the extra cookie you had last night or the extra piece of cake you had last month at the wedding. It's an accumulation of damage over several years,"" says Vivienne Hau, MD, PhD, a Kaiser Permanente ophthalmologist and retina specialist in Riverside, California. If blood sugars are consistently high, diabetic retinopathy will keep getting worse. ""The blood vessels in the eye get weak, which can cause bleeding, swelling and scarring, retina detachments, and early cataracts,"" says Dr. Hau. ""In fact, studies show diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-age populations."" It's very important, she continues, to get your eyes checked at least once a year if you have diabetes. ""Finding retinopathy or other eye conditions early gives you a better chance of avoiding vision loss and blindness,"" says Dr. Hau.13. Good support makes everything easier""The daily, unrelenting needs of managing diabetes can be very challenging,"" says Rodriguez. ""Diabetes distress and depression are very common in people living with diabetes. There's no need to feel embarrassed or that you're not tough enough."" Create your own support team with your doctors, nutritionist, family, and friends. Utilize online support groups or join a support group in your area. And if you still feel like you can't get out of your funk seek counseling. ""It is a sign of strength to reach out to others,"" Rodriguez says.Reviewed by: Preeti Parikh, MD .

Foods That Can Help Control Blood Sugar in Diabetic Diet,"While medication, sleep, stress, and time of day can all play a role in diabetes management, experts agree that diet is one of the most important factors to keep in mind. That's because specific food choices can have a direct effect on your blood sugar levels, says Toby Smithson, RDN, CDE, the coauthor of Diabetes Meal Planning and Nutrition for Dummies and the founder of Diabetes EveryDay, of Hilton Head, South Carolina.Inattention to what you decide to nourish yourself with can lead to serious consequences, like an increased risk of vision problems, nerve damage, amputations, and even death. ""Managing blood glucose levels is key to preventing future complications,"" Smithson says.The reason why people with diabetes develop excess amounts of sugar in their blood is insulin resistance, the hallmark of the disease. Insulin resistance is the inability of the hormone insulin to effectively transport glucose, or blood sugar, to the body's cells to be used for energy or stored as fuel for future use. When sugar can't reach the body's cells it accumulates in the blood, potentially leading to the aforementioned complications.Regularly checking your blood sugar is one of the best ways to ensure it stays controlled, according to the Mayo Clinic. You can use a glucose meter to self-monitor your levels and observe what impact different factors — like exercise, stress, and food choices — may have. To figure out when and how often to check your blood sugar, consult your primary care provider, because these recommendations tend to vary based on the type of diabetes you have and your individual health profile.While everybody's goal may be different, there are certain kinds of foods experts agree are good and bad in a diabetes diet, based on both their nutritional value and where they lie on the glycemic index — a scale used to rank foods by how much or little they tend to cause blood sugar fluctuations. Counting carbohydrates is a good foundational approach to take. During digestion, your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose (a type of sugar), so eating too many high-carb foods can raise the amount of sugar in your blood.Also keep in mind that foods high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat can complicate your diabetes management, as they may harm your waistline, and maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for reducing insulin resistance. In fact, losing just 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can help prevent or delay the progression of type 2 diabetes if you're an adult who is at a known risk for the disease, according to the Obesity Society. Steering clear of sugary and salty foods as well as foods high in unhealthy fats can also help your heart — a must for people with diabetes, as this group is at a greater risk of heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.To stay on track with your diabetes management, start with these 10 diabetes-friendly foods that fit this description and are known for their abilities to help keep blood sugar controlled.",https://t.co/BB5x9AZMIR,others

Put the Focus on Dinner for Blood Sugar Control,"How often have you advised your patients to have a good breakfast, lunch, and supper, to have spaced-out meals, and reminded them of all the fundamentals of diabetes management so that their blood sugars can be easily controlled? And how often have you realized that they never do that? If you give your patients complex regimens that have to be taken in the morning and evening, they tend to forget doses. Most people will consume their largest meal in the evening when they get home from work. You may have many patients who are beginning to fail multiple combinations of oral anti-hyperglycemics. How do you tackle this problem? If you give your patients complex regimens that have to be taken in the morning and then again in the evening, patients tend to forget doses. Therefore, adherence may be compromised, leading to diminished diabetes control. Here are a couple of ideas that you could implement. Focus on the Largest Meal of the Day On a background of metformin, if the patient has failed other combinations, such as with a sulfonylurea or a DPP-4 inhibitor, people have added basal insulin. If your patient is failing with basal insulin and you need to take another step, remember that the largest meal is often in the evening. You could combine the basal insulin with a GLP-1 agonist, such as a combination of insulin degludec plus liraglutide. Patients could take that just once with their largest meal, which would be in the evening, and it would be very effective in controlling their blood sugars. Studies have shown that when you compare this combination with [a basal insulin], the A1c-lowering effect is similar.[1,2,3] The amount of hypoglycemia and weight gain is also decreased. This combination is probably going to be more easily followed by a patient because of these factors. It will also increase patient quality of life. If that does not control your patient's blood sugar levels, you can give a combination of a basal insulin plus a fast-acting insulin—such as degludec plus aspart—once with their largest meal, which is usually in the evening when they are relaxed and able to remember. This combination will also control their A1c and postprandial highs much better than a multiple daily injection dose because of issues with adherence. I hope that these solutions will help you manage your patients with diabetes who are losing control of their blood sugars with oral anti-hyperglycemics. Thank you.",https://t.co/CL6oGKge4u,others
Apple Cider Vinegar Diabetes Benefit,"Apple cider vinegar can lower fasting, postprandial glucose, and A1C. It can lower blood pressure &amp; cholesterol levels and improves nutrient absorption.What is Apple Cider Vinegar?Yeast ferment sugar in the fruit juices into alcohol. Acetic acid bacteria ferment it further into vinegar. Vinegar is a French word, means ""sour wine."" Vinegar means sour wine. It has been in use for over 10,000 years as a condiment, preservative, flavoring, deodorant, tonic, and as a healing agent.There are different varieties of vinegar based on the source they made from:Apples - Apple cider vinegar,Grapes - Wine vinegar &amp; balsamic vinegar,Cereals such as barley - Malt vinegar.Diluted distilled alcohol - Distilled vinegar or white vinegar.The major component of apple cider vinegar is acetic acid. Raw, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar is rich in enzymes &amp; potassium.""Hippocrates"" the father of medicine endorsed apple cider vinegar as a healing elixir and cleansing agent. Hippocrates used apple cider vinegar both as an antibiotic and as antiseptic to treat his patients.Warriors used apple cider vinegar for their strength and power. During the war, they used vinegar to disinfect and heal wounds. Recently, Apple cider vinegar has found to improve insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics. Vinegar has found effective in controlling postprandial and fasting blood glucose. Apple cider vinegar for diabetes treatmentApple cider vinegar lowers fasting sugar level, post-meal glucose spikes, and A1C. Vinegar helps earlier post-meal satiety (feeling fullness) and improved insulin sensitivity.In type 2 diabetes vinegar reduces postprandial hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia without affecting lipolysis. Ref: Vinegar Consumption Increases Insulin-Stimulated Glucose Uptake by the Forearm Muscle in Humans with T2D. Journal of Diabetes Research 2015; 2015:175204.Apple cider vinegar detoxifies your body, drop fat storage, promote digestion. Thus your insulin resistance vanishes or insulin sensitivity improves.Vinegar can improve postprandial insulin sensitivity. Acetic acid was shown to suppress disaccharidase activity and raise glucose-6-phosphate concentrations in skeletal muscle. Thus, vinegar may own property same as diabetes drug acarbose or metformin. Reference: Diabetes Care January 2004 vol. 27 no. 1 281-282.Apple cider vinegar lowers your fasting sugar level, even for people with dawn phenomena. Apple cider vinegar at bedtime lower fasting glucose by 4 to 6% in individuals with type 2 diabetes.In 2007 study with 11 type 2 diabetes shows ingesting 2 tsp. of apple cider vinegar before bedtime lower fasting blood sugar by 4 to 6%. Vinegar may change the glycolysis/gluconeogenic cycle in liver. Thus helps diabetics with metabolic disturbance and dawn phenomenon. Reference: Diabetes Care November 2007 vol. 30 no. 11 2814-2815.​Apple cider vinegar improves the postprandial sugar spikes in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It might be by slowing down sugar absorption. Ingesting vinegar 5 minutes before a meal decreases postprandial glucose in type 1 diabetes by about 20%.Reference: Vinegar Decreases Postprandial Hyperglycemia in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes. Diabetes Care 2010 Feb; 33(2): e27-e27.Apple cider vinegar improves both postprandial and fasting sugar level. Thus you can able to achieve your target A1C level whether you are type 1 or type 2 diabetes.Vinegar has acetic acid and microbes (digestive friendly bacteria and enzymes). It could provide benefits of the three different classes of diabetes drugs. It is beneficial for type 2 and type 1 diabetes. It lower fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, and A1C level. However, use of vinegar should not replace healthy eating, exercise, or any glucose-lowering medications.How apple cider vinegar can lower blood sugar levels? Many argue vinegar lower their postprandial sugar by inhibiting carbohydrate digestive enzymes. Thus carbohydrate diet has a lesser impact on your blood sugar. This argument is not buyable, because when it stops carbohydrate absorption. Later, it should cause a gas problem due to fermentation. Users claim apple cider vinegar lowered their gas trouble. This show, it is not stopping carb digestion instead, help proper carbohydrate digestion.How Apple cider vinegar help regulate insulin? ​By delaying your gastric emptying, stimulating the liver, and making the muscles consume more glucose. In simple terms, vinegar makes the body use the carbohydrates efficiently. Vinegar reduces postprandial insulin &amp; glucose spikes by increases muscle glucose uptake. Diabetics with gastroparesis should avoid apple cider vinegar because of it further slow down gastric emptying. Thus worsen diabetes control.Reference: Effect of apple cider vinegar on delayed gastric emptying in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a pilot study. BMC Gastroenterology 2007 Dec 20; 7:46.Use Apple cider vinegar &amp; Cinnamon for better BS controlCinnamon and vinegar combined might lower blood sugar even better. Ingest 4 g cinnamon and 2 g acetic acid combined before meals can produce better blood glucose lowering effect. Alternatively, you can soak cinnamon sticks in the vinegar for 2 to 3 days and drink this vinegar.

So, better to drink vinegar using straw (but not necessary) to avoid enamel corrosion.",https://t.co/xZNQDDI7ur,others
Blood Sugar Level Chart and Diabetes Information,"A doctor might order a test of the sugar level in a person's blood if there is a concern that they may have diabetes, or have a sugar level that is either too low or too high. The test, which is also called a check of blood sugar, blood glucose, fasting blood sugar, fasting plasma glucose, or fasting blood glucose, indicates how much glucose is present is present in a person's blood.What Is Blood Sugar Level?Blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is defined as the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. The body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis. The international standard way of measuring blood glucose levels are in terms of a molar concentration, measured in mmol/L (millimoles per liter; or millimolar, abbreviated mM). In the United States, mass concentration is measured in mg/dL (milligrams per decilitre) - See our mmol/L to mg/dl chart for blood sugar number conversions.When a person eats carbohydrates, such as pasta, bread or fruit, their body converts the carbohydrates to sugar - also referred to as glucose. Glucose travels through the blood to supply energy to the cells, to include muscle and brain cells, as well as to organs. Blood sugar levels usually fluctuate depending upon what a person eats and how long it has been since they last ate. However; consistent or extremely low levels of glucose in a person's blood might cause symptoms such as:AnxietySweatingDizzinessConfusionNervousnessWarning signs of dangerously high levels of blood sugar include sleepiness or confusion, dry mouth, extreme thirst, high fever, hallucinations, loss of vision, or skin that is warm and dry.A blood sugar test requires a finger prick or needle stick. A doctor might order a, 'fasting,' blood glucose test. What this means is a person will not be able to drink or eat for 8-10 hours before the test, or the doctor may order the test for a random time or right after the person eats. If a woman is pregnant, her doctor might order a, 'glucose-tolerance test,' which involves drinking glucose solution and having blood drawn a specified amount of time later. The results of a blood sugar test are measured in milligrams per deciliter.Average Blood Sugar LevelsAverage Blood Sugar Levels100 mg/dL average140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating180 mg/dL 1 hour after drinking glucose155 mg/dL 2 hours after drinking glucose140 mg/dL 3 hours after drinking glucose95 mg/dL after fasting for glucose-tolerance test for pregnant womenThe results of blood sugar tests vary by testing method and lab but generally doctors consider a fasting blood sugar of up to 100 mg/dL to be within the average range. From blood drawn 2 hours after a person eats, doctors consider a level of up to 140 mg/dL to be average. In a glucose-tolerance test for pregnant women, a level of 95 mg/dL after fasting is considered to be the, 'target,' level. A doctor who is concerned might order additional testing at 1,2 and 3 hours after a person drinks glucose. The target levels for those tests are 180 mg/dL, 155 mg/dL and 140 mg/dL. Gestational diabetes is indicated if 2 or more of the 4 levels equal or go over the desired target level.High Blood Sugar Levels'Hyperglycemia,' or high fasting blood sugar levels of between 100-150 mg/dL, might indicate pre-diabetes and levels above this range may indicate diabetes. A number of other conditions may cause hyperglycemia too, including:AcromegalyPancreatitisAcute stressRenal failureHyperthyroidismPancreatic cancerCushing syndromeHyperglycemia may also be the result of excessive over-eating or taking some prescription medications.Low Blood Sugar LevelsChart showing symptoms of low blood sugar'Hypoglycemia,' or low blood sugar, might suggest that a person is not eating enough or that they are taking too much diabetes medication or insulin. Additional causes of hypoglycemia include hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism and having taken certain kinds of medications. A blood sugar level below 60 mg/dL, or a drop of more than 100 mg/dL an hour at any time indicates hypoglycemia.Average A1C Test LevelAn A1C test is performed to measure the average of a person's blood sugar levels over the last 3 months. The results of the test are presented as a percentage. The average range falls in between 4-6%. A1C test levels of greater than 7% reveal poor diabetes management and the need for changes in the future. Some important facts about blood sugar include the following:Insulin is a hormone produced by a person's pancreas, it helps to maintain average blood sugar levelsGlucose is a simple sugar; it is one of the primary molecules that serve as energy sources for both animals and plantsHigh or uncontrolled blood sugar levels may lead to health complications such as heart disease, blindness or kidney diseaseIncreased concentration of glucose in a person's blood leads to a condition referred to as, 'diabetic coma,' or hyperglycemiaBlood Sugar ChartDiabetes Check - Blood Sugar LevelsHbA1cmg/dlmmol/llowless than 4less than 65less than 3,6Normal4653,6Normal4,1693,8Normal4,2724Normal4,3764,2Normal4,4804,4Normal4,5834,6Normal4,6874,8Normal4,7905Normal4,8945,2Normal4,9975,4Good51015,6Good5,11055,8Good5,21086Good5,31126,2Good5,41156,4Good5,51196,6Good5,61226,8Good5,71267Good5,81307,2Good5,91337,4At Risk61377,6At Risk6,11407,8At Risk6,21448At Risk6,31478,2At Risk6,41518,4At Risk6,51558,6At Risk6,61588,8At Risk6,71629At Risk6,81659,2At Risk6,91699,4Danger Zone71729,6Danger Zone7,11769,8Danger Zone7,218010Danger Zone7,318310,2Danger Zone7,418710,4Danger Zone7,519010,6Danger Zone7,619410,8Danger Zone7,719811Danger Zone7,820111,2Danger Zone7,920511,4Complications Can Arise820811,6Complications Can Arise8,121211,8Complications Can Arise8,221512Complications Can Arise8,321912,2Complications Can Arise8,422312,4Complications Can Arise8,522612,6Complications Can Arise8,623012,8Complications Can Arise8,723313Complications Can Arise8,823713,2Complications Can Arise8,924013,4Very Dangerous924413,6Very Dangerous9+261+13,6+Printable Blood Sugar Level Reference Chart(Right click and save to desktop then print)Printable blood sugar level chartImproving Fasting Blood Sugar LevelsIf a person does not have perfect fasting blood sugar levels, yet the levels are not quite high enough to be considered diabetes, they should take it as an opportunity to improve their health and achieve average blood glucose levels prior to developing type 2 diabetes. Usually, high blood sugar levels have to do with a poor diet, but even more often they have to do with a person's lack of exercise and physical activity.A number of medical studies have shown a dramatic relationship between elevated blood sugar levels and insulin resistance in people who are not very active on a daily or regular basis. Many of the same studies have also shown that the most efficient way of improving insulin resistance is to increase the amount of physical activity. Doing so helps a person to achieve weight loss, increase blood flow and circulation, as well as lower blood sugar levels.Deciding to begin exercising and become active also involves beginning to eat better. Changing eating habits alone will help, yet doing both together will supercharge a person's efforts. Try to find a cookbook filled with quality foods and meal plans that are ideal for people with diabetes, people with pre-diabetes, as well as those with high blood sugar levels who might be insulin resistant.",https://t.co/Ei8Fyh5IbY,others
Truth About Blood Sugar,"Truth About Blood SugarIt is widely held that the primary instigator of diabetes is sugar, which has led to recommendations to eat a low carbohydrate diet and avoid sugar at all costs, including fruit. Sugar and unhealthy carbohydrates from things like pastries, cakes, cookies, doughnuts, and candy are indeed bad for us and should be avoided. However, our bodies need healthy carbohydrates to function, which can be found in foods such as butternut squash, sweet potatoes, carrots, lentils, black beans, berries, apples, and other fruits. When we eat carbohydrates (regardless of the source), our body breaks them down into glucose (blood sugar), which becomes the fuel that keeps us going—and keeps us alive. When glucose levels rise, our pancreas secretes the hormone insulin. Insulin helps usher glucose out of the bloodstream and into our cells where it can be used for energy, and keeps our blood sugar levels stable. However, this process can go awry if the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin, or if some of your cells stop responding to insulin, which is called insulin resistance. In either case, blood sugar levels remain elevated, putting you at risk for type 2 diabetes.The Role of Fat Contrary to popular belief, one factor that is much more likely to put you at risk for insulin resistance and diabetes than healthy carbs such as those listed above is a high-fat diet. There are several reasons for this. First, high blood fat levels put a major strain on your liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands, which work together to manage your blood sugar levels. Your liver has to shoulder the burden of processing the fat you eat, so a high-fat diet can make the liver sluggish and unable to store and release glucose as it should. Excess fat burdens your pancreas because it needs to release enzymes to aid fat digestion. Additionally, when blood fat levels are high, the adrenals flood the body with adrenaline. While this increases digestive strength to help move fat through your system, excess adrenaline can wear away at the pancreas, reducing its ability to produce enough insulin to keep your glucose levels in check. Lastly, high blood fat levels can prevent glucose from entering cells. This is not to say that all fat, even healthy fats such as nuts, seeds, and avocados, are bad for us and need to be completely eliminated. Regardless of your chosen diet, fat intake just needs to be moderated to avoid excessively high blood fat levels when you are dealing with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. For instance, if you eat a vegan diet, reduce the amount of fat you take in from nuts, nut butters, seeds, oils, avocados, etc. If you are ovo-lacto vegetarian, cut back on eggs, dairy, nuts, seeds, oils, avocado, etc. If your diet includes animal protein, cut back to one serving of meat per day (even lean meats contain appreciable amounts of fat). Scaling back on fat in this manner helps ease the burden on your pancreas, liver, and adrenal glands, which goes a long way toward preventing and/or healing from diabetes. If you opt to maintain a high-fat diet (which may normalize your A1C levels in the short-term), it becomes especially important to limit your carb intake, as a diet high in both fat and carbs will tax your bodily systems that much more. Ultimately, reducing dietary fat and including healthy carbs of the kind listed above will help give you the best shot at healing from diabetes and help keep your A1C levels in a healthy range on a more permanent basis. The Role of AdrenalineA precursor to type 2 diabetes is hypoglycemia (when glucose levels drop below normal), which is due to a stagnant, sluggish, overburdened, or weakened liver and dysfunctional adrenal glands. In fact, both type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia typically begin with malfunctioning adrenals. When you experience chronic stress, for example, your adrenal glands secrete copious amounts of adrenaline, which is very damaging to the pancreas. Hypoglycemia can also occur if you don't eat at least a light, balanced snack—e.g., a fruit (for sugar and potassium) and a vegetable (for sodium)—every two hours. Skipping meals forces your body to use up your liver's glucose storage, driving the body to run on adrenaline, which can damage your pancreas and lead to insulin resistance. Too little adrenaline can also impair your pancreas, as it forces it to work overtime to compensate. Adrenal fatigue, in which unstable adrenals alternate between producing too much and too little adrenaline, can also harm your pancreas as it tries to compensate for dry spells of adrenaline and then gets scorched by floods of it. (for more on adrenal fatigue, click here)Healing Foods In addition to scaling back fat intake, it is important to incorporate healthy carbohydrates into your diet. Healing carbohydrates such as squash, sweet potatoes, other root vegetables and fruit contain critical nutrients for optimal health, and when the natural sugars in these healthy carbs are bonded to these nutrients, it does not wreak havoc on your blood sugar levels the way processed sugar does. Wild blueberries, papayas, blackberries, apples, and raspberries are top fruits to eat if you have type 2 diabetes or hypoglycemia. Vegetables to focus on include spinach, celery, sprouts, kale, and asparagus. These foods help detoxify the liver, strengthen glucose levels, support the pancreas, boost the adrenal glands, and stabilize insulin. To keep your blood fat in check, it is best to avoid cheese, milk, cream, butter, eggs, processed oils, and all sugars except for raw honey and fruit. While these recommendations fly in the face of conventional strategies for preventing and managing type 2 diabetes, emphasizing nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables and reducing dietary fat eases the burden on your liver, pancreas, and adrenals, helping ensure that they can perform their duties, including keeping your blood sugar as stable as possible. Make friends with healthy carbs and fruit, curtail your fat intake, and reclaim the healthy life you are meant to live!

You can also learn more about how to address type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia in Anthony William's book Medical Medium: Secrets Behind Chronic and Mystery Illness and How to Finally Heal.This item posted: 25-Feb-2016",https://t.co/YDv2D5OOKJ,others

Amazon Alexa Launches its First HIPAA-Compliant Medical Skills,"The multitrillion-dollar health care industry is one hell of a market, especially with well over 70 million baby boomers hitting an age when health care is a necessity, not to mention 80 million millennials who are finally getting around to having kids. So, it makes sense that Amazon, which has been investing heavily in experimental health care projects and trials of its signature smart speaker in hospitals, would start creating HIPAA-compliant medical skills for its voice assistant, Alexa.HIPAA stands for the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which has two main purposes: First, to provide continuous health insurance coverage for workers who lose or change their jobs and, more importantly to Amazon, to standardize the electronic transmission of administrative and financial transactions.Amazon ran a trial of smart speakers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the last year, acquired online pharmacy PillPack for millions of dollars, and commanded its flagship division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to expand its HIPAA-compliant abilities.There are some hurdles for companies to jump through to get on Alexa's health care platform, but a bunch of big companies have a huge start. Amazon launched a site that enables companies to describe the health care skills they have in mind, giving Amazon a platform by which to vet the developers who want to apply to the program.The program has launched with six new Alexa health care skills from major providers, payors, pharmacy benefit managers, and digital health coaching companies. The biggest is probably Cigna Health, whose users can command Alexa to ask Cigna Health Today for a daily tip.""With our industry-leading voice skills, we are meeting customers where they are — in their homes, in their cars — and making it simpler to create healthier habits and daily routines.

"Study finds diabetes drug may prevent, slow kidney disease","A drug that's used to help control blood sugar in people with diabetes has now been shown to help prevent or slow kidney disease, which causes millions of deaths each year and requires hundreds of thousands of people to use dialysis to stay alive.Doctors say it's hard to overstate the importance of this study, and what it means for curbing this problem, which is growing because of the obesity epidemic.The study tested Janssen Pharmaceuticals' drug Invokana. Results were discussed Sunday at a medical meeting in Australia and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.About 30 million Americans and more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes , and most cases are Type 2, the kind tied to obesity. It occurs when the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, which turns food into energy.This can damage the kidneys over time, causing disease and ultimately, failure. In the U.S., it's responsible for nearly half a million people needing dialysis, and for thousands of kidney transplants each year.Some blood pressure drugs lower this risk but they're only partially effective. The new study tested Invokana, a daily pill sold now to help control blood sugar, to see if it also could help prevent kidney disease when added to standard treatments.For the study, about 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease from around the world were to be given Invokana or dummy pills. Independent monitors stopped the study early, after 4,400 people had been treated for about 2.5 years on average, when it was clear the drug was helping.Those on the drug had a 30% lower risk of one of these problems — kidney failure, need for dialysis, need for a kidney transplant, death from kidney- or heart-related causes, or other signs that kidneys were failing.For every 1,000 people taking the drug for 2.5 years, there would be 47 fewer cases of one of these problems, researchers estimate.Rates of serious side effects were similar in the drug and placebo groups including leg, foot or toe amputations, a concern raised by a previous study of Invokana. One side effect, when the body can't produce enough insulin, was more frequent among those on Invokana but rare overall.Janssen, which is part of Johnson &amp; Johnson, sponsored the study and many authors work or consult for the company. The drug costs about $500 a month in the U.S. Out-of-pocket costs for patients may be different, depending on insurance.The importance of this large and well-done study ""cannot be overstated,"" Drs. Julie Ingelfinger and Clifford Rosen, editors at the medical journal, wrote in an accompanying article.In recent years, several studies have found that Invokana and some similar drugs can lower heart risks. The new results, showing that Invokana also may stall or prevent kidney failure, expand the potential benefits of the drug.___Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

How Bananas Affect Diabetes and Blood Sugar Levels,"When you have diabetes, it is important to keep blood sugar levels as stable as possible.Good blood sugar control can help prevent or slow the progression of some of the main medical complications of diabetes (1, 2). For this reason, avoiding or minimizing foods that cause big blood sugar spikes is essential.Despite being a healthy fruit, bananas are pretty high in both carbs and sugar, the main nutrients that raise blood sugar levels.So, should you be eating bananas if you have diabetes? How do they affect your blood sugar? If you have diabetes, being aware of the amount and type of carbs in your diet is important.This is because carbs raise your blood sugar level more than other nutrients, which means they can greatly affect your blood sugar control.When blood sugar rises in non-diabetic people, the body produces insulin. It helps the body move sugar out of the blood and into the cells where it's used or stored. However, this process doesn't work as it should in diabetics. Instead, either the body doesn't produce enough insulin or the cells are resistant to the insulin that is made.If not managed properly, this can result in high-carb foods causing big blood sugar spikes or constantly high blood sugar levels, both of which are bad for your health.93% of the calories in bananas come from carbs. These carbs are in the form of sugar, starch and fiber (3). A single medium-sized banana contains 14 grams of sugar and 6 grams of starch (3).Bottom Line: Bananas are high in carbs, which cause blood sugar levels to rise more than other nutrients. In addition to starch and sugar, a medium-sized banana contains 3 grams of fiber.Everyone, including diabetics, should eat adequate amounts of dietary fiber due to its potential health benefits. However, fiber is especially important for people with diabetes, as it can help slow the digestion and absorption of carbs (4). This can reduce blood sugar spikes and improve overall blood sugar control (5).One way of determining how a carb-containing food will affect blood sugars is by looking at its glycemic index (GI). The glycemic index ranks foods based on how much and how quickly they raise blood sugar levels. The scores run from 0 to 100 with the following classifications: Low GI: 55 or less.Medium GI: 56–69.High GI: 70–100.Diets based on low-GI foods are thought to be particularly good for people with type 2 diabetes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10).This is because low-GI foods are absorbed more slowly and cause a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels, rather than large spikes. Overall, bananas score between low and medium on the GI scale (between 42–62, depending on the ripeness) (11). Bottom Line: In addition to sugar and starch, bananas contain some fiber. This means that the sugars in bananas are more slowly digested and absorbed, which could prevent blood sugar spikes. The type of carbs in your banana depends on the ripeness. Green or unripe bananas contain less sugar and more resistant starch (12, 13). Resistant starches are long chains of glucose (starch) that are ""resistant"" to digestion in the upper part of your digestive system (14).This means that they function in a similar way as fiber, and won't cause a rise in blood sugar levels.However, they may help feed the friendly bacteria in your gut, which has been linked to improved metabolic health and better blood sugar control (15, 16, 17, 18). In fact, a recent study on blood sugar control in women with type 2 diabetes found some interesting results. Those supplementing with resistant starch had better blood sugar control than those who didn't over an 8-week period (19). Other studies have found resistant starch to have beneficial effects in people with type 2 diabetes. These include improving insulin sensitivity and reducing inflammation (20, 21, 22, 23). The role of resistant starch in type 1 diabetes is less clear.Bottom Line: Green (unripe) bananas contain resistant starch, which doesn't raise blood sugar and may even improve long-term blood sugar control. Yellow or ripe bananas contain less resistant starch than green bananas and more sugar, which is more quickly absorbed than starch.This means that fully ripe bananas have a higher GI and will cause your blood sugar to rise faster than green or unripe bananas (13). Bottom Line: Yellow, ripe bananas contain more sugar than green, unripe ones. This means they cause a bigger rise in your blood sugar level. Ripeness isn't the only factor when it comes to the amount of sugar in your banana.Size also matters. The bigger the banana, the more carbs you will be getting. This means that a larger banana will have a greater effect on your blood sugar level.This portion-size effect is called the glycemic load.Glycemic load is calculated by multiplying the glycemic index of a food by the amount of carbs in a serving, then dividing that number by 100.A score of less than 10 is considered low, 11–19 is medium and more than 20 is high.Here's the approximate amount of carbs in the different sizes of bananas (3): Extra small banana (6 inches or less): 18.5 grams.Small banana (about 6–6.9 inches long): 23 grams.Medium banana (7–7.9 inches long): 27 grams.Large banana (8–8.9 inches long): 31 grams.Extra large banana (9 inches or longer): 35 grams.If all these bananas were fully ripe (GI of 62), then their glycemic load would range from 11 for an extra small banana to 22 for an extra large banana.To ensure you don't cause your blood sugar to rise too much, it's important to be aware of the size of the banana you're eating.Bottom Line: The size of the banana you eat determines its effect on your blood sugar level. The larger the banana, the more carbs you'll consume and the greater the rise in your blood sugar will be. Most generic dietary guidelines for diabetes recommend following a healthy, balanced diet which includes fruit (24, 25, 26).This is because eating fruits and vegetables has been linked with better health and a lower risk of disease, such as heart disease and some cancers (27, 28, 29). Diabetics are at an even greater risk of these diseases, so eating enough fruits and vegetables is important (30, 31). Unlike refined sugar products like candies and cake, the carbs in fruit such as bananas come with fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. More specifically, bananas provide you with fiber, potassium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. They also contain some antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds (32).A recent study looked at the effect of limiting fruits on the blood sugar control of 63 people with type 2 diabetes (33). They found that advising people to eat no more than 2 pieces of fruit per day resulted in people eating less fruit.However, they also found that eating less fruit did not improve blood sugar control, weight loss or waist circumference. For most people with diabetes, fruits (including bananas) are a healthy choice.One exception to this is if you're following a low-carb diet to control your diabetes. Even a small banana contains around 22 grams of carbs, which may be too much for your diet plan.If you are able to eat bananas, it's important to be mindful of the ripeness and size of the banana to reduce its effect on your blood sugar level. Bottom Line: Fruits like bananas are a healthy food that contains fiber, vitamins and minerals. You can include bananas in your diet, even if you have diabetes. If you have diabetes, it's perfectly possible to enjoy fruit such as bananas as part of a healthy diet.If you like bananas, the following tips could help minimize their effects on your blood sugar levels: Watch your portion size: Eat a smaller banana to reduce the amount of sugar you eat in one sitting.Choose a firm, nearly-ripe banana: Pick a banana that's not overly ripe so that the sugar content is slightly lower.Spread your fruit intake throughout the day: Spread out your fruit intake to help reduce the glycemic load and keep your blood sugar stable.Eat them with other foods: Enjoy your bananas with other foods, such as nuts or full-fat yogurt, to help slow down the digestion and absorption of the sugar.If you're diabetic, remember that all carb-containing foods can affect people's blood sugars differently.Therefore, you might want to monitor how eating bananas affects your blood sugar and adjust your eating habits accordingly.",https://t.co/k19mA25maE,others
Beer and blood sugar - Q2 Q&A 16 - Podcast Ep. 423,"VIDEO2. Beer and blood sugarThom says:Robb and Nicki: Thanks each a lot for the work you do to teach the Paleo/Keto group.

The outcomes I've skilled are nothing wanting miraculous. That has led me to grow to be an enormous advocate for the life-style and to share it with anybody who will hear. I do heating and air-con service, which affords me the chance to share it with many individuals.My query is that this: You could have talked about many instances that we should always do as many N=1 experiments to see what works for us individually. I've been retaining tabs on my blood sugars, blood stress, O2 and coronary heart price ranges in addition to a number of scientific blood assessments (I do not go to the physician fairly often, since all they wish to do is shove medication in me each time I am going in). Through the years I have been capable of hone in on nearly all of meals or existence that make me really feel good and those that make me really feel not-so-good. That stated, I wished to pose a query to you. I've carried out this check again and again and am very shocked by the outcomes. If I've a typical dinner with a salad or veggies of some kind and a few meat, then pair that with low carb wine or tequila, lime and soda water (each very low carb drinks), my blood sugars will likely be someplace between 130 and 180 two hours later. Nevertheless, if I've beer (sometimes darkish, as a result of I desire the porters and stouts) and examine my blood sugars two hours later, I am normally under 100 and generally as little as 80 or 78. I've examined these variables again and again all through this previous 12 months (sure, I like my drink) and I get the identical outcomes. Nevertheless, I HAVE seen that the lighter beers, reminiscent of ales or lighter IPA's don't maintain my blood sugars fairly as low.Have you learnt of something that may clarify this phenomenon?I've many extra questions I wish to ask you, however I am going to depart it at this one for now. Once more, thanks each for all you've got carried out and are doing to maintain this group going.

Before placing him on my chest he had obviously already been cleaned with a towel to remove all the blood and fluid from his body.Now while I was already prepared for this moment, my mum who was in the delivery room with me couldn't understand why I would not want my child to be bathed immediately. In all honesty i didn't tell her before hand because I knew she was going make a big deal out of it and try to change my mind. But I knew she would not argue with me too much in the delivery room and I had already told my husband not to allow her say otherwise if I slept off.While I knew it was going to be strange to her I had already on Children'sMD that there were benefits of delaying the first bath of my baby by 24hours. whereas I wanted to be awake and fully alert fro his first bath. Babies are born covered in a white substance called vernix, which is composed of the skin cells your baby made early in development. Vernix contains proteins that prevent common bacterial infections. Vernix is nature's protection against these infections.Think of vernix as a sort-of natural antibacterial ointment. Your baby is born covered in this anti-germ barrier. Bathing a baby too soon after birth can cause low blood sugar. Here's why: in the first few hours after birth a baby has to adjust to life outside the uterus, including losing the placenta as a source of blood sugar. Bathing causes crying, stress and the release of stress hormones. Stress hormones can cause a baby's blood sugar to drop, which can make a baby too sleepy to wake up and breastfeed, causing the blood sugar to drop even more. Giving a baby a bath too soon can cause hypothermia. In the first few hours after birth a baby has to use a lot of energy to keep warm. If a baby gets too cold, he or she can drop their blood sugar or have other complications.New babies need to snuggle skin-to-skin with their mom be given a chance to try to breastfeed. Infants who are held skin-to-skin on mom's chest have better blood sugar and temperature control and have an easier time learning to breastfeed. We even do skin-to-skin at c-section deliveries. The bath can wait. If you wait more than an hour to breastfeed, babies can have a hard time latching, sucking and swallowing. If you breastfeed right away, the baby still remembers how to suck and swallow. If you put a baby skin-to-skin between mom's bare breasts at delivery, she will be warm, soothed by mom's voice, find the breast herself, latch right on and start nursing. Vernix is a natural skin moisturizer and skin protectant. Babies need skin protection during the transition from the amniotic fluid into the air environment. If you delay the bath, there is no need for artificially scented baby lotion. Hospital workers are always supposed to wear gloves when caring for an unbathed baby, to prevent exposure to body fluids such as amniotic fluid and blood. Some studies have shown that glove-wearing keeps babies safer too, by preventing transmission of common viruses and other infections from workers to babies.After mom has had time to recover, parents can more easily participate in baby's first bath and it becomes a teaching opportunity between nursing and parents. ""Babies are not born dirty,"" says Michael Farmer, head of the Department of Family Practice and postpartum medical director at BC Women's Hospital &amp; Health Centre. ""There is no urgent need to get the newborn baby bathed, and this can be delayed at the parents' request. Mother-baby bonding time is very important, and the caregivers would not want to interfere with skin-to-skin time and establishing breastfeeding. Bathing a newborn can certainly wait."" A good towel rub is all that's needed to remove any amniotic fluid, blood and meconium, he adds.""The first bath in hospital is now much more of a teaching and learning experience for the new parents,"" says Farmer. ""It is not done for hygiene, but it is certainly helpful for parents to learn how to bathe their newborns.""I initially thought it would be strange to suggest such in Nigeria but imagine my surprise when the President, Nigerian Society of Neonatal Medicine (NISONM), Professor Chinyere Ezeaka said that cleaning babies is very good, but we allow them to delay the first bath to at least after the first 24 hours to keep the baby warm. It is the best way of keeping the baby warm.At the end of the day it all depends on your personal preference, it is up to you to birth your baby immdiately or wait a few hours but I chose to wait 24 hours before the first birth and I don't regret it.Comments Comments",https://t.co/v7jbCjJ2T8,others
Studies Show What Happens To The Human Body When We Walk Barefoot On Earth,"By Arjun WaliaThe picture above represents Improved facial circulation (right image) after 20 minutes of grounding, as documented by a Speckle Contrast Laser Imager (dark blue=lowest circulation; dark red=highest circulation). Image Source: Scientific Research PublishingGrounding, or 'earthing,' as some people call it, involves placing your feet directly on the ground without shoes or socks as a barrier. The logic behind this practice relates to the intense negative charge carried by the Earth. This charge is electron-rich, theoretically serving as a good supply of antioxidants and free radical destroying electrons.According to Dr. James Oschman, a PhD in biology from the University of Pittsburgh and an expert in the field of energy medicine, ""Subjective reports that walking barefoot on the Earth enhances health and provides feelings of well-being can be found in the literature and practices of diverse cultures from around the world. For a variety of reasons, many individuals are reluctant to walk outside barefoot, unless they are on holiday at the beach.""It makes sense if you think about it; in our most natural state, we wouldn't have anything covering our feet. Putting your feet on the ground enables you to absorb negative electrons through the soles of your feet, and this can help to align your body to the same negatively charged electrical potential as the Earth.The ScienceA study published in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health titled ""Earthing: Health Implications of Reconnecting the Human Body to the Earth's Surface Electrons"" postulates that earthing could represent a potential treatment for a variety of chronic degenerative diseases.It concluded that simple contact with the earth, through being either outside barefoot or indoors connected to grounded conductive systems, could serve as a natural and ""profoundly effective environmental strategy"" against chronic stress, ANS dysfunction, inflammation, pain, poor sleep, disturbed HRV, hyper-coagulable blood, and many common health disorders, including cardiovascular disease: ""The research done to date supports the concept that grounding or earthing the human body may be an essential element in the health equation along with sunshine, clean air and water, nutritious food, and physical activity.""Another study, conducted by the Department of Neurosurgery from the Military Clinical Hospital in Powstancow, Warszawy, along with other affiliates like the Poland Medical University, found that blood urea concentrations are lower in subjects who are earthed (connected to the earth potential with the use of copper wire) during physical exercise and that earthing during exercise resulted in improved exercise recovery.It concluded:These results suggest that earthing during exercise inhibits hepatic protein catabolism or increases renal urea excretion. Earthing during exercise affects protein metabolism, resulting in a positive nitrogen balance. This phenomenon has fundamental importance in understanding human metabolic processes and may have implications in training programs for athletes.A study published last year from the Developmental and Cell Biology Department at the University of California at Irvine found that grounding the human body improves facial blood flow regulation.As mentioned earlier, studies have also found grounding to reduce blood viscosity, a major factor in cardiovascular disease.One study, published in the Journal of Alternative and Complimentary Medicine,even concluded that earthing may be ""the primary factor regulating the endocrine and nervous system."" According to a review published in the Journal of Inflammation Research: Grounding reduces or even prevents the cardinal signs of inflammation following injury: redness, heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function (Figures 1 and 2). Rapid resolution of painful chronic inflammation was confirmed in 20 case studies using medical infrared imaging (Figure 3). . . . Our main hypothesis is that connecting the body to the Earth enables free electrons from the Earth's surface to spread over and into the body, where they can have antioxidant effects. Specifically, we suggest that mobile electrons create an antioxidant microenvironment around the injury repair field, slowing or preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS) delivered by the oxidative burst from causing ""collateral damage"" to healthy tissue, and preventing or reducing the formation of the so-called ""inflammatory barricade"". We also hypothesize that electrons from the Earth can prevent or resolve so-called ""silent"" or ""smoldering"" inflammation.Dozens of studies confirm the physiological effects of grounding, which include anything from anti-aging and heart health benefits to improved sleep and much, much more.""This simple process of grounding is one of the most potent antioxidants we know of. Grounding has been shown to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, improve sleep, enhance well being, and much, much more. Unfortunately, many living in developed countries are rarely grounded anymore."" – Dr Jospeh Mercola (source)When grounded, the diurnal rhythm of the stress hormone cortisol begins to normalize. Cortisol is connected to your body's stress response and helps control blood sugar levels, regulate metabolism, and reduce inflammation. The figure below shows the results of a study that examined the effects of being grounded while sleeping over the course of eight weeks.How You Can Get GroundedWe all spend most of our time walking on the earth wearing shoes with rubber or plastic soles. These materials are insulators, and accordingly we use them to insulate electrical wires. They also disconnect you from the Earth's electron flow, which we are supposed to be connected to. However, if you wear leather soled shoes (or vegan leather!) or walk barefoot on sand, grass, soil, concrete, or ceramic tile, you will be grounded. If you walk on asphalt, wood, rubber, plastic, vinyl, tar, or tarmac, you will not be grounded.So the next time you are outside, take off your shoes! You can also use conductive systems while sleeping, working, or spending time indoors for a more convenient and lifestyle-friendly approach.Schuman ResonanceIn 1952, German physicist Professor W.O. Schumann of the Technical University of Munich began attempting to answer whether the Earth itself has a frequency — a pulse. His assumption about the existence of this frequency came from his understanding that when a sphere exists inside of another sphere, an electrical tension is created. Since the negatively charged earth exists inside the positively charged ionosphere, there must be tension between the two, giving the Earth a specific frequency. Following his assumptions, through a series of calculations he was able to land upon a frequency he believed was the pulse of the Earth. This frequency was 10hz.It wasn't until 1954 that Schumann teamed up with another scientist, Herbert König, and confirmed that the resonance of the Earth maintained a frequency of 7.83 Hz. This discovery was later tested and verified by other scientists. Since then, the Schumann Resonance has been the accepted term used scientifically to describe or measure the pulse of the Earth.Even though the existence of the Schumann Resonance is an established scientific fact, there are few scientists who fully understand the important relationship between this frequency and life on the planet.Source: Collective Evolution Follow us Share this article",https://t.co/gDL38EP1UF,others

Instead of eating raw almonds in the morning you can try drinking almond milk. You can also go for soaked almonds.How many almonds can you eat in a day?Almonds are indeed healthy for you, but one should not ignore the fact that these provide you with a high amount of calories which are not suitable for your health and weight.

A count of a minimum 4 and maximum of 23 almonds in a day is excellent for your health and well-being.What will happen if you eat too many almonds every day?Excess of anything is terrible, and it goes for the healthy and nutritious almonds too. If you think that multiplying the number of almonds a day will give you quick results, then you are on the wrong page. Eating more than the required quantity will not prove beneficial but may have a derogatory effect on your health. Following are the troubles that you might suffer from if you eat almonds in excess.Digestive troubles: Almonds are rich in fiber and eating them in excess can cause hamper your digestion process.

However, if you do not maintain a balance, then a high dosage of Vitamin E might lead to weakness, diarrhea, and even blurred vision.High manganese content may interfere with medications: Almonds are rich in manganese which if taken in large amounts can interact with your laxatives, antibiotics and blood pressure medicines creating trouble for you.Toxicity: Bitter almonds are known to treat muscle spasms, but if you take them in excess, then it may lead to toxicity in your body. It is because these contain hydrocyanic acid that may cause problems in breathing, choking and can even result in nervous breakdown.Raw almonds vs. soaked almondsImage:ShutterStockRaw or soaked, almonds are great for your health. But if you are comparing the two, then soaked almonds are better than raw almonds. They are not only tastier but healthier too. It is because the brown coat of the almonds contains tannin which restricts the absorption of nutrients by the body. However, when the almonds are soaked, can be peeled easily making it easier for your body to absorb the nutrients. Soaked almonds release an enzyme known as lipase which is essential for digestion of fats. Also, these become softer and easier to chew. Thus, if you wish to enjoy the wholesome benefits of almonds, then soaked almonds are better.The crunchy nuts with a brown casing are a storehouse of nutrients which make them great for your overall health. Consuming almonds every day can be beneficial for your heart, brain, and other vital organs. Therefore, your mother always made sure that you definitely have those. Eating a handful of almonds a day can give you miraculous results. So, incorporate them in your diet now.",https://t.co/7aNmxTuHPU,others

Food Order Has a Significant Impact on Postprandial Glucose and Insulin Levels,"Postprandial hyperglycemia is an important therapeutic target for optimizing glycemic control and for mitigating the proatherogenic vascular environment characteristic of type 2 diabetes. Existing evidence indicates that the quantity and type of carbohydrate consumed influence blood glucose levels and that the total amount of carbohydrate consumed is the primary predictor of glycemic response (1). Previous studies have shown that premeal ingestion of whey protein, as well as altering the macronutrient composition of a meal, reduces postmeal glucose levels (2–4). There are limited data, however, regarding the effect of food order on postprandial glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (5). In this pilot study, we sought to examine the effect of food order, using a typical Western meal, incorporating vegetables, protein, and carbohydrate, on postprandial glucose and insulin excursions in overweight/obese adults with type 2 diabetes.A total of 11 subjects (6 female, 5 male) with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes were studied using a within-subject crossover design. The average (mean ± SD) age and BMI were 54 ± 9 years and 32.9 ± 5 kg/m2, respectively. The average duration of diabetes was 4.8 ± 2.4 years and the mean HbA1c was 6.5 ± 0.7%.After a 12-h overnight fast, subjects consumed an isocaloric meal (628 kcal: 55 g protein, 68 g carbohydrate, and 16 g fat) with the same composition on 2 separate days, 1 week apart. During the first visit, the food order was carbohydrate (ciabatta bread and orange juice), followed 15 min later by protein (skinless grilled chicken breast) and vegetables (lettuce and tomato salad with low-fat Italian vinaigrette and steamed broccoli with butter); the food order was reversed a week later. Blood was sampled for glucose and insulin measurements at baseline (just before meal ingestion) and 30, 60, and 120 min after the start of the meal.The mean postmeal glucose levels were decreased by 28.6% (P = 0.001), 36.7% (P = 0.001), and 16.8% (P = 0.03) at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively, and the incremental area under the curve (iAUC0–120) was 73% lower (2,001 ± 376.9 vs. 7,545 ± 804.4 mg/dL × 120 min, P = 0.001) when vegetables and protein were consumed first, before carbohydrate, compared with the reverse food order (Table 1). Postprandial insulin levels at 60 and 120 min and the iAUC0–120 were also significantly lower when protein and vegetables were consumed first.Table 1 Glucose and insulin levels/iAUC for various time points/intervals during the two visitsIn this pilot study, we demonstrated that the temporal sequence of carbohydrate ingestion during a meal has a significant impact on postprandial glucose and insulin excursions. The magnitude of the effect of food order on glucose levels is comparable to that observed with pharmacological agents that preferentially target postprandial glucose. Moreover, the reduced insulin excursions observed in this experimental setting suggest that this meal pattern may improve insulin sensitivity. A limitation of the study is that we analyzed glucose and insulin responses up to 120 min following meal ingestion, as this study was designed to test postprandial glucose levels as practically measured by patients with type 2 diabetes. Further studies with longer follow-up to delineate the full impact, including delayed effects and the mechanisms underlying the glycemic effect of food order, are indicated.In contrast to conventional nutritional counseling in diabetes, which is largely restrictive and focuses on ""how much"" and ""what not to eat,"" this pilot study suggests that improvement in glycemia may be achieved by optimal timing of carbohydrate ingestion during a meal.Article InformationAcknowledgments.

Blood Sugar Ultra Review - Controlling Sugar Levels Without Side Effects?,"High or fluctuating blood sugar can be quite dangerous for a human being, not to mention the diseases that they bring on as well. Imbalance in blood sugar levels leads to diabetes, PCOS, and several other health problems that might not go away for a lifetime. If we have problematic blood sugar levels, now is the time to start controlling them. If we don't we might face shorter life spans, a lowered quality of life, and several difficulties in other aspects as well. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are the two most common results of blood sugar issues. Naturally, these conditions don't make us look good or feel good about ourselves. As a result, depressive and anxiety disorders can also rise up to make our lives even more difficult. Science and research have not been stagnant on this issue, and we do have a plethora of methods for controlling blood sugar levels. While many people do try out the conventional medical route, there might be a safer, more effective path found in the Blood Sugar Ultra. With this, we might be able to find our problem dealt with from within instead of just handling the symptoms. Let's discuss this further below.About the Blood Sugar UltraThe Blood Sugar Ultra is mainly a dietary supplement that's formulated with ingredients designed to relieve the matter of rising blood sugar. The name itself will tell us that it just might be an excellent manner of reducing these levels in a safe, natural, yet potent manner. Many doctors might prescribe pills, injections, and extremely strict diets in order to bring the situation under control, but these might not always be possible. The pills and injections might have serious side effects, and cause issues with our body organs as well. Since the Blood Sugar Ultra is comprised of naturally sourced ingredients, we can be somewhat reassured that the side effects wouldn't be anything but beneficial.How the Blood Sugar Ultra WorksIn order to understand how the Blood Sugar Ultra supplement works, we must also understand why we contract Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and the other health problems related to blood sugar levels. This happens because our pancreas is not functioning properly, producing less insulin than we need to process everything we eat. As a result, all that sugar and glucose that we consume raise our blood sugar levels and can also cause fat deposits within our body. Since many diabetics require insulin injections, it's clear that we need to take steps for enhancing insulin production within our body. The ingredients in the Blood Sugar Ultra are geared towards doing just that. While the injections might work for some time, a natural method is obviously better in effect and durability. The ingredients are then the major reason for the Blood Sugar Ultra working so well for many users. Through the regular use of this supplement, many have found relief from the symptoms as well as an overall better state of physical health. With the proper diet and medical consultation, we might even be looking at a way to get rid of diabetes as much as possible.What to Expect from the Blood Sugar UltraThe Blood Sugar Ultra might not work right away, or even within a short period of time. It might take a few weeks, or even a month for the benefits to show up. When they do, however, we may expect a chance to live life to its full potential. This is by getting our energy and vitality back through controlled blood sugar levels. Plus, the Blood Sugar Ultra helps us achieve the benefits we need in an organic, natural manner. This assures us that we're moving towards a more normal life in the healthiest way possible. Those who have qualms about taking synthetic fillers, chemicals, and conventional medicine, in general, will also be delighted by this offering. Ingredients of the Blood Sugar UltraAs we've mentioned above, the Blood Sugar Ultra functions due to the nature and formulation of the ingredients inside those capsules. It's heartening to see that the ingredient information is released to the masses. This way, we can research all the components and confirm whether they really are good for controlling blood sugar levels.There's just one main ingredient, which is an extract from the Morus Indica plant. Laymen would know of this as the mulberry plant. The derivation of this ingredient is done through silkworms, who primarily feed upon mulberry leaves. We should check with our primary medical practitioner to make sure we're not allergic to mulberry in any form. If all's clear, the Blood Sugar Ultra just might be the supplement to control our blood sugar. Mulberry leaf extract is instrumental in improving three main functions of our internal systems. These are the blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and heart function. By taking a regular dose of this extract, we can look forward to an overall improved blood lipid profile. We can also do the research on mulberry leaves and find out just how beneficial it is for the proper level of insulin production. As long as we also watch our diets and include some exercise into our lifestyle, this ingredient could freely work wonders within our system.Side EffectsWe can also decide whether or not to take this supplement by working out whether we stand the risk of allergies from these ingredients. Hence, it's wise to check the full ingredient list and also keep in mind the details for the main ones, which are mulberry leaf and Morus Indica.Bonus MaterialsUpon purchasing the Blood Sugar Ultra, the users will be able to receive two bonus reports for absolutely free of cost. A brief description about each of these reports is given below:– The Lean Liver Jumpstart – This guide is equipped with delicious recipes that are not only easy to make but are also very nutritious. It has a 7-day meal plan, that will help the users melt dangerous fat and optimising their blood sugar levels.The Lean Liver Jumpstart– The Better Blood Sugar Protocol – This guide has an additional 30-day meal plan to further assist the users in losing weight, and keeping their glycemic index low.The Better Blood Sugar ProtocolMoney Back GuaranteeEven if the supplement does not work for us, as we all have different reactions, there's a 30-day guarantee that will give us a refund without any condition. With even the financial risk taken care of, we should head to the official website for Blood Sugar Ultra today and find out what it can do for us.Conclusion – Is Blood Sugar Ultra Worth Trying?While the Blood Sugar Ultra supplement might be comprised of just one main ingredient, the natural factor is a huge one when we're considering treatments. Previously, diabetes was seen as a debilitating disease with very little hope of resuming a normal life. With the Blood Sugar Ultra, we just might be able to regain our energy and deal with the blood sugar levels in an organic, long-lasting manner. The additional benefits of the mulberry leaf are also an excellent factor to consider. Since these will work to enhance our heart health as well as deal with cholesterol issues, we're getting a holistic solution.",https://t.co/qi2ZgU07As,others
Can Diabetes Be Prevented? 5 Tips To Hamper Blood Sugar Disease,"Type 2 diabetes is a common disease that usually develops in people who have a family history of blood sugar illness. Those who are diagnosed with prediabetes even obese people are also at a higher risk of the condition. Luckily, there are ways to prevent its development. Five of them are found below.Fiber-Rich FoodDietary fiber prevents obesity and diabetes. It is usually found in plant foods such as grains, vegetables and fruits, according to University Health News Daily. The most common sources of insoluble fiber are wheat bran, whole grains, cucumbers, skins of apples and grapes. Soluble fiber, on the other hand, aids in better digestion and is commonly found in beans, nuts, fruits, oats, seeds, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes and asparagus.The recommended intake of these fiber-rich foods is 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams for men. Specifically, you may also opt to eat at least two or three cups of these vegetables and fruits per day. Three servings of beans, lentils or peas a week, eating whole-grain bread instead of white bread and eating brown rice instead of white rice also does the trick.Healthy DietAs per Mayo Clinic, low-carb and glycemic index diets help you lose weight, but their long-term benefits in preventing diabetes remain unknown. Although these help you avoid obesity, which is a common cause of the blood sugar disease, it is more important to mind your nutrient intake than prioritizing weight loss.The recommended healthy diet for diabetics requires the patient to consume three meals a day at regular times. This helps you generate sufficient insulin and supports medication. Strict compliance with a diabetic diet also controls your blood sugar levels and manage your weight.The American Diabetes Association endorses the plate method that tells which portions of your plate is allotted for a particular ingredient. The portions are as follows: fill half of the plate with non-starchy vegetables such as tomatoes and spinach; a quarter of the plate must be filled with protein-rich food such as tuna, lean pork or chicken; the last quarter should then be allotted for whole grains such as brown rice or green peas.Physical Fitness ProgramAccording to WebMD, excess weight puts you at a higher risk of diabetes. You can regulate your pounds by performing regular aerobic and resistance training exercises that let you shed off weight fast, lower your blood sugar levels and boost your sensitivity to insulin.The recommended physical exercise for diabetics is a combination of aerobics and resistance training. You can perform at least 30 minutes of low-to-moderate-intensity aerobic exercise five times per week. For those who opt for a lighter exercise, ellipticals and stair-climbing also work.Avoid Trigger FoodsAccording to Help Guide, a diabetic must avoid trans fats contained in deep-fried foods. Fast foods are also high in sugar along with white bread, sugary cereals and refined pasta. Processed and red meat also trigger higher insulin levels and low-fat products that contain added sugars such as fat-free yogurt.Regular CheckupsAnother way to avoid diabetes is opting for a regular checkup with an endocrinologist. Even if you perform regular exercises and eat healthily, you regularly need to check on your body's insulin levels.You can prevent diabetes by seeing your doctor and undergo an exam every three to six months. This procedure checks on your blood pressure and other parameters to know if you harbor diabetes symptoms. Seeing your dentist every six months also helps you check if you are diabetes-free.",https://t.co/GFXb8DoRW8,others

Insulin resistance - The pre-diabetes warning sign to watch out for,"Insulin, blood sugar and diabetesInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that signals cells to extract glucose (blood sugar) from the blood. Some people mistakenly think that insulin actually participates in the action of glucose uptake. But, as a hormone, it simply signals the cells to take action. The actual glucose uptake is up to those cells. In fact, in some cases, glucose uptake can occur without insulin. The best example is with muscle cells during exercises, where cells can sometimes extract blood sugar without being signaled. But, in general, insulin is required to trigger this action. In diabetes, this action is broken. In a small percent of diabetics, the problem is because the pancreas cannot produce any insulin. This is referred to as type I diabetes. Far more common, however, is type II diabetes. Type II diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions in the US. At least initially, type II diabetes is not a condition of the pancreas and insulin production. Indeed, at least initially, type II diabetics produce considerably more insulin than a non-diabetic. Type II diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance, where insulin is produced but the cells do not respond sufficiently to it. In most cases, this results in more and more insulin being produced to compensate until eventually it is not possible to keep up. This is the point where diabetes can be diagnosed.Diabetes causes two primary problems. First, the cells are not getting the sugar they need for normal energy. And, second, the blood sugar raises to dangerous levels in the blood, causing tissues to become saturated with sugars, which causes these tissues to lose their flexibility and, eventually, their function. This is why diabetes are at a much higher risk for conditions like heart disease, and why they suffer nerve and blood vessel damage. Diabetes is diagnosed by testing the amount of glucose in the blood. Ideal blood sugar never goes above 100 mg/dL. A fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher, or any reading 200 mg/dL or higher on two occasions constitutes diabetes. A person with higher than normal readings, but below diabetic levels is sometimes said to be prediabetic, or insulin resistant. However, if your blood sugar is in the normal range, that may not tell the entire story. If you are insulin resistant but can produce extra insulin to keep your blood sugar in the normal range, that will not show up in a blood test that measures only your glucose. So why would cells become resistant to insulin? There are many factors that go into this process, including simple aging. While not all of the factors are understood or, likely, even known, I plan to discuss many of them here. But at the simplest level, it might help to look at it like this: Cells require energy. When insulin is detected, the cells sends its glucose transporters to the surface of the cell and extracts glucose from the blood. Now imagine a person who is inactive and eats a large amount of glucose-producing refined carbohydrate foods (as so many in the US do). Now the cells energy requirements are very low, but they are continually bombarded by ever increasing signals from insulin to come get more glucose. After a while, a cell may become less responsive to these signals. The number of insulin receptors in the cell may decrease. After all, why waste effort building insulin receptors when the cells gets more insulin signals and glucose than it knows what to do with. Obviously, it gets much more complex than this. There are many hormones in play here, which all interact with each other. But this seems to be at the core, and eating less carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates, and increasing exercises seems to be the best way to prevent diabetes, and the best way to minimize diabetes once it occurs.Insulin resistance is the condition where the body's response to insulin is significantly diminished. Lifestyle and genetics can push insulin resistance to the point where it becomes a serious problem. Pushed to the extreme, glucose levels will continue to rise as the pancreas falls further and further behind, and the result is type II diabetes. In fact, some degree of insulin resistance is expected and normal as we age. Unfortunately, way too many people today are making lifestyle choices that are making insulin resistance a global epidemic. As mentioned, type II diabetes is initially a disease of insulin resistance rather than problems producing insulin. Indeed, type II diabetics generally produce more insulin than the average person until it gets burned out or damaged from the disease. If you are at risk for diabetes but your blood tests show a normal glucose level, those tests may not be telling the whole story. It's possible for a person to be producing high quantities of insulin, resulting in a normal glucose reading. Such a person may not know they are at risk of developing diabetes, and high levels of insulin–a condition called hyperinsulinism. Hyperinsulinism can cause a number of adverse health effects on its own, which may include hypertension (high blood pressure). People with insulin resistance are likely to have a number of other conditions, which tend to occur together. These conditions, together, are called metabolic syndrome (formerly known as syndrome X). These conditions include excessive abdominal fat, blood fat disorders (including high triglycerides, low HDL (good) cholesterol, high LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, whole-body inflammation, and other conditions). These conditions are reaching epidemic proportions in the US largely as a result of poor lifestyle. In general, modern populations tend to get too many calories, eat foods that are too refined, and exercise too little. Refined carbohydrate foods can quickly be converted to blood sugar. Eaten in large quantities, this diet can flood the system with blood sugars. And with people who are inactive, their cells need very little sugar for energy. It's little wonder that cells can stop ""listening"" to insulins signal to extract more sugar from the blood. A diet that involves less overall calories, less fats (particularly saturated fats), less refined carbohydrates (sweets!), and more whole foods and fiber, and regular exercise have been shown to reduce the risk of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes.",https://t.co/AHzN3PnYco,others

Fill out the following form to download your FREE mg/dl to mmol/L conversion chart Whats the difference between mmol/L and mg/dL? Both sets of units are used to measure blood sugar levels and both give a measurement of the concentration of glucose in the blood, albeit in slightly different ways. mmol/L gives the molarity, which is the number of molecules of a substance within a specified volume, in this case within 1 litre. mg/dL gives the concentration by the ratio of weight to volume, in this case milligrams per decilitre. mmol/L is the most common measurement used in the UK with mg/dL predominantly used in the USA and continental Europe. Blood glucose typically varies from 4 mmol/L to 6 mmol/L for people without diabetes. Blood sugar (also called blood glucose) needs to be tightly controlled in the human body to minimise the risk of complications developing. Formula to calculate mmol/l from mg/dl: mmol/l = mg/dl / 18 Formula to calculate mg/dl from mmol/l: mg/dl = 18 × mmol/l Can I change the units given by my blood glucose meter? This can depend on which blood glucose meter you have. Some meters allow you to change the units from mg/dL to mmol/L and vice versa whether some meters are only set up to display one set of units. Check the meter's manual for whether it is possible to change the units. If you don't have or cannot find the manual, contact the manufacturer. Why are blood sugar levels important? Measuring blood sugar levels and understanding what your glucose levels should be is an essential part of diabetes treatment for many people with diabetes. Blood sugar level refers to the total amount of glucose circulating in the blood. In different parts of the world, different units for measuring blood glucose are standard.

Further, almonds are a rich source of Vitamin E, flavonoids and phytochemicals which can help fight the damaging cells that can lead to breast cancer.8. Regulate blood sugar levelsAlmonds are rich in fibers and proteins and are low in carbs that make them excellent for people who have diabetes. Fiber present in them slows down the digestion process thus preventing a sudden spike in the blood glucose levels. Studies show that people with type 2 Diabetes have magnesium deficiency which can be resolved by eating almonds as these are a rich source of magnesium. Improved magnesium content in the body boosts the function of insulin and lowers the blood sugar.9. Increases your energy levelsIf your mornings are lousy and gloomy, and you have no zest to celebrate a fresh new day of your life, then almonds are essential for you. Start your day, high on energy by eating a few soaked almonds. These are rich in essential nutrients like riboflavin, manganese, and copper that help in optimal functioning of your body mechanism and boost your metabolism, thus providing you a high dose of energy necessary to start your day with a bang.

Instead of eating raw almonds in the morning you can try drinking almond milk. You can also go for soaked almonds.How many almonds can you eat in a day?Almonds are indeed healthy for you, but one should not ignore the fact that these provide you with a high amount of calories which are not suitable for your health and weight. Hence, you must munch this amazing snack in a limited amount only. Studies say that you must keep your almond intake under check. A count of a minimum 4 and maximum of 23 almonds in a day is excellent for your health and well-being.What will happen if you eat too many almonds every day?Excess of anything is terrible, and it goes for the healthy and nutritious almonds too. If you think that multiplying the number of almonds a day will give you quick results, then you are on the wrong page. Eating more than the required quantity will not prove beneficial but may have a derogatory effect on your health. Following are the troubles that you might suffer from if you eat almonds in excess.Digestive troubles: Almonds are rich in fiber and eating them in excess can cause hamper your digestion process. It may lead to bloating and upset stomach.Weight gain: Almonds provide you with high amount calories and fat.

Can Meditation Control It?,"Meditation is a way of relaxing the mind through techniques such as focusing and controlled breathing. It has been around for centuries and many people continue to use meditation to benefit both the body and the mind. People meditate to reduce stress and relieve a variety of physical ailments. Recent research showed meditation can also help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.Achieve a More Peaceful State of MindMeditation helps people achieve a more peaceful state of mind. It takes focus and practice to reach a peaceful meditative state of mind. No special equipment is required to meditate. Effective meditative techniques have been shown to reduce mental stress and hormone release. Cortisol, one of those hormones, can raise blood sugars when elevated. Today's world is so fast paced with multiple daily stressors and taking time for ""oneself"" with meditation is important for overall health, including your diabetes.Types of MeditationThere are different types of meditation. Research presented at an American Diabetes Association conference showed mindfulness meditation is beneficial for people with diabetes. Quiet contemplation helps you put aside worries about the past and future. The motions of breathing can bring you into the present moment. This helps you quiet the mind. Mindfulness meditation relieves anxiety and depression, which are common symptoms for people with diabetes.Mindfulness MeditationMindfulness meditation can be done sitting on a chair, on a cushion or the floor. You can also lie on the floor. The object is to bring yourself into the present moment by focusing on your breathing. When your mind begins to wander, gently return to the breath. At the beginning, your mind may constantly wander. Do not pass judgement on yourself, just refocus on the breath. Always wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing while meditating. Find a quiet, uncluttered place with natural light and fresh air for the best practice. Singing birds or a gentle waterfall are sounds which can stay in the background without you losing your focus. Beginners can start with 10 minutes of practice a day then eventually work up to over an hour daily, if desired. Use a timer to set your ""intention."" Mindful meditation is simple yet not easily achieved as it takes practice.Transcendental MeditationAnother type of meditation is transcendental meditation which is practiced world-wide by millions of people. Transcendental meditation originated in India in the 1950s, by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. This is typically done sitting on the floor with your eyes closed. You focus on one word or phrase silently, which is called a ""mantra."" Your mantra can be as simple as the word ""one"" or ""om"". Chant the word and keep breathing for 10 minutes each day. After a week, try 15 minutes daily then work up to 20 minutes twice a day. Transcendental meditation does not require mindfulness or ""monitoring of thoughts"" as in mindfulness meditation. This helps clear the mind of any thoughts. According to research, Transcendental meditation may help lower stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, addiction, PTSD, and raise the immune system. It may lead to a healthier heart by, ""recharging the brain and mind"".Moving MeditationMoving meditation is another type of meditation and includes tai chi, qigong and walking meditation. Tai chi originated in ancient China and embraces the mind, body and spirit. There are multiple styles, but all tai chi practices share the same principles. These principles integrate the mind and body through movements and breathing. It brings tranquility, better health and helps you think more clearly. Also originated in China, is another moving meditation called Qigong. It is a ""mind, body and spirit practice,"" which can improve mental and physical health. Qigong integrates posture, breathing, focus and intent by doing slow, gentle movements. Walking meditation involves bringing mindfulness and awareness to your walk. It can be done indoors or outdoors and does not require a lot of space. You take 10-15 steps forward and then back on the same path. The point is using your brain, your breath and your feet together. Walking meditation involves slow, small, natural steps, nothing exaggerated, with arms and hands hanging by your sides. Focusing on your sensations as you experience the walk is the primary goal.Concentration meditation is another form of mediation that focuses on a single point. It could be a mantra or word, listening to a repetitive sound like a gong or bell, counting beads on a mala(string) or staring at a flame of a candle. When your mind wanders, you refocus your awareness on the specific object. After time, this helps your concentration improve.How Meditation Can Help YouIf you are unsure about how to meditate, there are classes, books, DvDs, YouTube videos and smartphone Apps available to help you learn. There are websites on meditation as well. Yoga instructors and community centers may offer classes in meditation. Meditation helps minimize stress levels and lowers blood pressure. It reduces levels of stress hormones including cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Hormones such as cortisol contribute toward weight gain, belly fat and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance increases diabetes risk. Excess weight increases the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and related heart problems.A study in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed transcendental meditation can help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels. It can also lower blood pressure and reduce insulin resistance. Meditation is also used to relieve chronic pain. People with diabetes who have nerve pain-neuropathy or back pain are subject to increased stress and blood sugar levels. Reducing pain through meditation minimizes anxiety and related health problems as well as blood sugar readings. Use blood pressure monitors or blood pressure machines before and after meditation sessions to gauge your progress. Have a glucose meter handy to keep track of your blood sugar levels prior and subsequent to meditation. Give yourself a few weeks to master the techniques and start seeing real results.Exercise trains the body and meditation train the mind. Many people with diabetes find meditation is a good way to reduce stress, lower blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure readings and minimize pain. Dr. Herbert Benson, a researcher at Harvard University in the 1970s coined the term, ""relaxation response"" after doing research on people who practiced TM. Discuss the possibilities of meditation with your health care provider or diabetes care team. Regular meditation should become an important part of your diabetes self-management program.Have a question or comment? Then post below, no registration is required. I would love to hear from you!

International Newsletter 2018,"Pretoria, South AfricaAFRICAP project meetingIn March 2018, Jennie Macdiarmid attended the 'kick off' meeting of the AFRICAP project (Agriculture and food-system reliance: increasing capacity and advising policy) along with all the other partners (£9 million Global Challenges Research Fund grant). This is an interdisciplinary project about food and nutrition security in Africa, led by the University of Leeds University in collaboration with University of Aberdeen, MetOffice and Chatham House, working with local organisations and government in Malawi, South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania (co-ordinated by FANRPAN). The overall aim of the project is support the development of climate-smart, sustainable agriculture to deliver nutrition security, thereby helping countries to reduce poverty and hunger whilst addressing the broader aims of the Sustainable Development Goals. The meeting was the first time that all the partners met face-to-face, and reinforced that this is a very exciting project, working with a great team of people. During our stay we visited several sites to see first-hand some of the different types of farming systems in rural South Africa. This gave us an important insight into the type of environments that we will be working. Webpage: https://africap.info/ Hyderabad, IndiaCentenary of the National Institute of NutritionOne of our deputy directors, Baukje de Roos, recently travelled to Hyderabad, India, to attend the 100-year centenary of the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), which is the premier nutrition research Institute in India funded through the Indian Government, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Throughout its long history, NIN has been driving policy actions for improving nutrition outcomes in India.As part of the centenary celebrations, the NIN hosted an International conference ""Aligning food systems for healthy diets and improved nutrition"" from November 11 – 13, 2018, and as part of this conference Baukje was invited to present on ""Impacts of agroecosystems producing farmed seafood on food security and nutritional status – a global perspective"". Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food production sectors globally. Yet its specific impact on nutrition and livelihood in local communities, especially in low and medium income countries where commercial and/or export-orientated aquaculture activities are developed, is largely unknown. Establishing the relationships between aquaculture agro-ecosystems producing nutritious foods, and its impact on the health and nutritional status of local communities living in such dynamic aquatic eco-zones, is currently challenging for various reasons.At the conference Baukje presented some initial data on the development of an innovative metric to link food security, nutritional status, and health &amp; well-being outcomes to provide a better understanding of impacts of the access to aquatic foods on health. Ultimately this is believed to provide a better understanding of impacts of access to aquatic foods on health, resulting in more integrated and relevant policies and practices when further developing farmed aquatic systems.The meeting was attended by more than 500 delegates from 29 different countries, and included representatives of the FAO, the World Bank, Institute of Economic Growth, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation, Biodiversity International, Government representatives and various academic institutions around the world. Important global issues such as food diversity, agricultural production systems and measuring nutritional status were disucssed. Aligning with the remit of the conference, we were treated to some Indian native treats during one of the dinner parties, which included hornet's larvae, silkwork larvae cooked in fermented bamboo shoots, and water beetles. Elche, SpainBuckwheat scale up for human studyAs part of RESAS work investigating novel crops, scientists from the Rowett Institute have developed a new food formulation using sustainable crops with potential to grow in Scotland. For the design of this original functional food, the scientists used a biotechnological approach. This food is a buckwheat-rich beverage and will be tested in a human dietary intervention study for its potential to modulate sugar metabolism in healthy and type 2 diabetes volunteers. This human study will start next year.In order to produce the food for this dietary study, in May 2018, Madi Neacsu has travelled to S-E Spain to work in a food grade pilot scale plant for two weeks. The pilot plant is a spin-off company from Miguel Hernandez University from Elche. Here she successfully scaled up the original recipe to prepare the functional buckwheat-rich beverage developed at the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen. A total of six batches of beverage were produced and shipped back to Scotland. Ubatuba, Brazil DEVIL project meeting (Delivering Food Security on Limited Land)At the beginning of November the DEVIL research team, including Jennie Macdiarmid, met in Ubatuba for a project meeting hosted by the Brazilian partners in the project. The project team comprised partners from the UK, Brazil, South Africa, China, India, Australia, Switzerland and USA. DEVIL is an international, interdisciplinary research project on food and nutrition security and land use, led by the University of Aberdeen and funded by the Belmont Forum and the FACCE-JPI Initiative. Using state-of-the art food system and land use models, a number of scenarios for future food and nutrition security have been developed and are being tested. These take into account land availability, international trade, climate change and economic and political conditions of food production and supply. While they were in Brazil they visited an area of agroforestry in some of the last remaining parts of the Atlantic rainforest. Here they were able to see how small scale agriculture was being integrated in the forest and had the opportunity to eat meals made from locally grown foods in the forest. More information can be found here &gt;&gt; https://deliveringfoodsecurity.org/team Lima, PeruGlobal Research CouncilIn May 2018 Karen Scott was part of a group of UK researchers who visited Lima, Peru. The trip was designed to introduce researchers from Peru and the UK with the aim of promoting research collaborations that would go forward to a co-funded Global Research Council/Newton Fund research grant funding scheme. The first two days were devoted to workshop style discussions where people presented their main research interests and discussed research targets. The Peruvian National Council of Science (CONCYTEC) had identified key research targets focussed on improving nutrition and health in Peru, targeting the double burden of obesity and malnutrition. On the final day of the visit we toured two local science institutes. The National Agrarian University La Molina is an agriculture University on the outskirts of Lima, which has assembled a large collection of ancient chillis collected from all round Peru. A separate research programme is focussed on breeding quinoa plants capable of growing at different altitudes. We also visited the National Health Institute in Lima and were introduced to several food programmes used in schools to improve childhood nutrition. Harare, ZimbabweSustianable food production workshopIn May 2018, researchers from the Rowett Institute and the Crop Technology Development Organisation (CTDO) co-hosted a stakeholder consultative workshop in Harare to identify a sustainable way forward to achieve long-term food production in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is a landlocked, low-income, food deficit country in sub-Saharan Africa. This year more than one million people faced food insecurity with current projections estimating that 2.5 million people are at risk. In addition to widespread poverty; HIV/AIDS, limited employment opportunities, liquidity challenges, recurrent climate-induced shocks and economic instability also have a significant impact and undernutrition particularly effects rural regions where diets lack diversity, with maize being the main staple crop. The workshop was timely, especially considering that the Zimbabwe government are currently reviewing the agricultural policy framework. It was attended by a wide range of stakeholders including senior level representatives from the Zimbabwean Ministry for Agriculture, Agriculture Research Council, Oxfam, World Food Program, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, as well as farmers' associations, academics and industry. Coverage of the outcomes were disseminated via prime time evening and breakfast news, as well as in the national press. Recommendations arising from the event have been prepared as policy documents and there was a clear consensus that crop diversification through utilization of neglected and underutilized species (NUS) is critical to improving food and nutrition security in Zimbabwe. The second day was dedicated to field trips to develop a deeper insight into the various perspectives of nutritional security in Zimbabwe. This included visiting a solar water project, nutrition garden, maternal waiting home and primary school in the Mutoko District. Particularly relevant to the work on NUS was a visit to Chimukoko Seed Bank in the Mudzi District. Here the researchers had an opportunity to discuss seed diversification and storage with local woman farmers who displayed a wonderful array and detailed knowledge of underutilized crops and seeds. The Rowett and CTDO researchers are continuing to work together to secure further funding to work with other in-country partners to develop a strategy for crop diversification through adoption of NUS and an improved understanding regarding their inclusion in our diet.",https://t.co/tDG8kYQPhw,others
How To Balance Blood Sugar,"Oh, the words ""blood sugar.""Does it conjure up visions of restrictive eating, diabetes medications, or insulin injections?Blood sugar is the measure of the amount of sugar in your blood. You need the right balance of sugar in your blood to fuel your brain and muscles.The thing is, it can fluctuate. A lot.This fluctuation is the natural balance between things that increase it; and things that decrease it. When you eat food with sugars or starches (""carbs""), then your digestive system absorbs sugar into your blood. When carbs are ingested and broken down into simple sugars, your body keeps blood sugar levels stable by secreting insulin. Insulin allows excess sugar to get it out of your bloodstream and into your muscle cells and other tissues for energy.Why keep my blood sugar stable?Your body wants your blood sugar to be at an optimal level. It should be high enough, so you're not light-headed, fatigued, and irritable. It should be low enough that your body isn't scrambling to remove excess from the blood. Most of the clients I see are on a rollercoaster of blood sugar highs and lows (hence the picture), and this can cause fatigue, sleepiness, irritability, sensitivity to stressors, poor quality sleep, poor concentration, weight gain and more.When blood sugar is too low, this is referred to as ""hypoglycemia.""When blood sugar is too high, it is referred to as hyperglycemia. Prolonged periods of elevated blood sugar levels (chronic hyperglycemia) can lead to ""insulin resistance."" Insulin resistance is when your cells are just so bored with the excess insulin that they start ignoring (resisting) it, and that keeps your blood sugar levels too high.Insulin resistance and chronic hyperglycemia can eventually lead to diabetes.So let's look at how you can optimise your food and lifestyle to keep your blood sugar stable.Food for stable blood sugarThe simplest thing to do to balance your blood sugar is to reduce the number of refined sugars and starches you eat. To do this, you can start by dumping sweet drinks and having smaller portions of dessert.Eating more fibre is helpful too. Fibre helps to slow down the amount of sugar absorbed from your meal; it reduces the ""spike"" in your blood sugar level. Fibre is found in plant-based foods (as long as they are eaten in their natural state, processing foods removes fibre). Eating nuts, seeds, and whole fruits and veggies (not juiced) is a great way to increase your fibre intake. FUN FACT: Cinnamon has been shown to help cells increase insulin sensitivity. Not to mention it's a delicious spice that can be used in place of sugar. (HINT: It's in the recipe below)Fat and protein do not increase your blood sugar (unless you have huge amounts of protein) and this means they are create foods to fill up on, without triggering that insulin response.Lifestyle for stable blood sugarExercise also helps to improve your insulin sensitivity; this means that your cells don't ignore insulin's call to get excess sugar out of the blood. Not to mention, when you exercise, your muscles are using up that sugar they absorbed from your blood. But you already knew that exercise is healthy, didn't you?Would you believe that stress affects your blood sugar levels? Yup! Stress hormones increase your blood sugar levels. If you think about the ""fight or flight"" stress response, what fuel do your brain and muscles need to ""fight"" or ""flee""? Sugar! When you are stressed signals are sent to release stored forms of sugar back into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar levels. So, try to reduce the stress you're under and manage it more effectively. Simple tips are meditation, deep breathing, or gentle movement.Sleep goes hand-in-hand with stress. When you don't get enough quality sleep, you tend to release stress hormones, have a higher appetite, and even get sugar cravings. Sleep is a crucial, often overlooked, factor when it comes to keeping your blood sugar stable. Make sleep more of a priority – it will do your blood sugar (and the rest of your physical and mental health) good.ConclusionYour body is on a constant 24-hour quest to keep your blood sugar stable. The body has mechanisms in place to do this, but those mechanisms can get tired (resistant). Long-term blood sugar issues can spell trouble.There are many nutrition and lifestyle approaches you can take to help keep your blood sugar stable. Minimising excessive carbs, and eating more fibre, protein and fat, exercising, reducing stress, and improving sleep are all key to having stable blood sugar (and overall good health).Check out this blood sugar balancing Cinnamon Apples recipe.",https://t.co/fGJXU34xiv,others
How Sleep Affects Blood Sugar,"Sleep is very important, but it is underestimated by people today. There is no alternative for sleep. People who are very busy tend to compromise their sleep just to finish what they need to do. Sleep deprivation can cause lots of disadvantages for the body and brain, and for the health in general. It can also affect the blood sugar level. If the blood sugar level is affected, it is can become risky. Did you know that LORNA VANDERHAEGHE GLUCOSMART WITH CHIROSITOL can help with your blood sugar level? You would like to try and see it for yourself. Do not underestimate the power of sleep and its effect on your blood sugar level.Importance of Sleep:Sleep deprivation can cause a loss of focus. You will notice if you lack of sleep, you will have a hard time thinking straight, and focusing on what you need to do within the day. That is a big disadvantage, because you may not be able to hit your deadlines, and if you are in a meeting and you need to brainstorm, you will probably not be able to provide ideas. You will not be able to finish what you need to do. At this point, you might think that the cause of your sleep deprivation is because you are finishing all that needs to be done and a day is not enough to finish all of it. Sleep deprivation does not actually get compromised by your deadlines and brainstorming, but it is the other way around. Have you ever thought that maybe you will be able to have better ideas if you are sleeping enough?If sleep deprivation has been your habit, it can be a risk to your overall health. Initial response of the body on sleep deprivation is feeling drowsy and experiencing mood swings – which can lead to the feeling of depression. You will feel deep loneliness for no reason. You will have hard times taking in new information in your mind and to have new ideas. The tendency is you will crave for sweets because your happy hormones are decreasing. This will cause your blood sugar to double up because as you deprive yourself of sleep, your blood sugar increases and then you will crave for sweets. What could possibly happen then? That is a risk on your health for sure. Blood Sugar Level on SleepSleep deprivation can cause chronic stress, which will eventually lead to elevated blood sugar level. As the blood sugar increases, there will be a great risk of diabetes. When you do not sleep well, your metabolism tends to slow down. There were studies that have shown people who are experiencing sleep deprivation have a higher risk of diabetes than people who have at least 8 hours of sleep. If you experience high blood sugar level, it will be harder for you to sleep. It will become a cycle – as you do not get enough sleep, your blood sugar will get high and then you will have a hard time sleeping. You will not be able to get out of the circle.One of the culprits of gain weight is sleep deprivation. Eight hours of sleep is the time when the body digest the food. If you do not sleep properly, the tendency is the digestive system will not function properly and that results in the slowing of the metabolism. Also if you lack sleep, your tendency is to feel hunger more frequently. You crave for food more often. If you are feeling sleepy, you will feel energy loss, so your tendency is to eat foods that will give you energy such as sweets, ice cream, chocolates, cakes, and candies. This may lead to obesity. Improper sleeping habits will lead to improper eating habits and places higher risk on your health.ConclusionSome people might think that there are more important things that need to be done than sleep. It just eats the time instead of working on things that are hitting the deadlines. If this is how you perceive sleep, you need to consider having proper time management instead of compromising your sleep. It is a wrong mindset that sleep will only consume your time, because you really need to find time to sleep. The body needs sleep more than you know and feel. You need to adjust your time management instead of not sleeping properly – like plotting your schedule ahead of time. Always set aside at least 8 hours of your time for sleep. You will see the difference in your health, and even in your mood if you are getting enough sleep. Moreover, the eight hours of sleep should happen at night, because it is the processing time of the digestive system. Do what you need to do in the morning and the 8 hours of your time from night to morning should be for sleeping. If you want to stay healthy and happy, monitor your blood sugar. Monitoring your blood sugar needs proper sleeping habits. Sleep properly and live healthy and long.Article Submitted By Community WriterHow Sleep Affects Blood Sugar was last modified: May 16th, 2019 by Dr Prem Community Writer",https://t.co/WHXe4ip4Na,others
How to Prevent Blood Sugar and Triglyceride Spikes after Meals,"Standard American meals rich in processed junk and meat and dairy lead to exaggerated spikes in sugar and fat in the blood, as you can see at 0:13 in my video How to Prevent Blood Sugar and Triglyceride Spikes after Meals. This generates free radicals, and the oxidative stress triggers a biochemical cascade throughout our circulation, damaging proteins in our body, inducing inflammation, crippling our artery function, thickening our blood, and causing a fight-or-flight nerve response. This all happens within just one to four hours after eating a meal. Worried about inflammation within your body? One lousy breakfast could double your C-reactive protein levels before it's even lunchtime. Repeat that three times a day, and you can set yourself up for heart disease. You may not even be aware of how bad off you are because your doctor is measuring your blood sugar and fat levels while you're in a fasting state, typically drawing your blood before you've eaten. What happens after a meal may be a stronger predictor of heart attacks and strokes, which makes sense, since this is where most of us live our lives—that is, in a fed state. And it's not just in diabetics. As you can see at 1:30 in my video, if you follow nondiabetic women with heart disease but normal fasting blood sugar, how high their blood sugar spikes after chugging some sugar water appears to determine how fast their arteries continue to clog up, perhaps because the higher the blood sugars spike, the more free radicals are produced. So, what are some dietary strategies to improve the situation? Thankfully, ""[i]mprovements in diet exert profound and immediate favorable changes...,"" but what kind of improvements? ""Specifically, a diet high in minimally processed, high-fiber, plant-based foods such as vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts,""—antioxidant, anti-inflammatory whole plant foods—""will markedly blunt the post-meal increase"" in sugar, fat, and inflammation. But what if you really wanted to eat some Wonder Bread? As you can see at 2:23 in my video, you'd get a big spike in blood sugar less than an hour after eating it. Would it make a difference if you spread the bread with almond butter? Adding about a third of a cup of almonds to the same amount of Wonder Bread significantly blunts the blood sugar spike. In that case, would any low-carb food help? Why add almond butter when you can make a bologna sandwich? Well, first of all, plant-based foods have the antioxidants to wipe out any excess free radicals. So, nuts can not only blunt blood sugar spikes, but oxidative damage as well. What's more, they can even blunt insulin spikes. Indeed, adding nuts to a meal calms both blood sugar levels and insulin levels, as you can see at 3:02 in my video. Now, you're probably thinking, Well, duh, less sugar means less insulin, but that's not what happens with low-carb animal foods. As you can see at 3:23 in my video, if you add steamed skinless chicken breast to your white rice, you get a greater insulin spike than if you had just eaten the white rice alone. So, adding the low-carb plant food made things better, but adding the low-carb animal food made things worse. It's the same with adding chicken breast to mashed potatoes—a higher insulin spike with the added animal protein. It is also the same with animal fat: Add some butter to a meal, and get a dramatically higher insulin spike from some sugar, as you can see at 3:45 in my video. If you add butter and cheese to white bread, white potatoes, white spaghetti, or white rice, you can sometimes even double the insulin reaction. If you add half an avocado to a meal, however, instead of worsening, the insulin response improves, as it does with the main whole plant food source of fat: nuts. I've covered the effect adding berries to a meal has on blood sugar responses in If Fructose Is Bad, What About Fruit?, and that raises the question: How Much Fruit Is Too Much?. In addition to the all-fruit jam question, I cover The Effects of Avocados and Red Wine on Postprandial Inflammation. Vinegar may also help. See Can Vinegar Help with Blood Sugar Control?. Perhaps this explains part of the longevity benefit to nut consumption, which I discuss in Nuts May Help Prevent Death. I also talk about that immediate inflammatory reaction to unhealthy food choices in Best Foods to Improve Sexual Function. Surprised by the chicken and butter reaction? The same thing happens with tuna fish and other meat, as I cover in my video Paleo Diets May Negate Benefits of Exercise.

Life Sciences, Volume 82, Issues 21–22, 23 May 2008, Pages 1045-1049.Unlike conventional drugs, herbal medicines are complex mixtures of bioactive compounds. Season, growing condition, processing method can vary the constitutions of the bioactive compound.8 Medicinal uses of Salacia oblongaSalacia Oblonga is consider to possess anti-diabetic agent. Traditionally, it is in use for blood-glucose management, effective for type 2 diabetes management and also beneficial for type 1 diabetes.For a test meal, the blood glucose level drop by about 23 % in non-diabetic human subjects given 1 gram of Salacia oblonga extracts with the test meal, according to a study in the January 2005 issue of the ""Journal of the American Dietetic Association.""Improves blood sugar - Salacia oblonga inhibits carbohydrate absorption, increase the efficiency of insulin action, decrease postprandial insulin, increases tissue glucose sensitivity, decrease in blood glucose, and decrease HbA1c.Cholesterol control - S oblonga has lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects. It is capable of improving lipid profiles and systemic inflammation in diabetics. It lowers serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and increasing HDL cholesterol levels.Kidney tonic - Oblonga stabilizes kidney function both in diabetics and nondiabetics, suggesting it benefits for CKD patients thus consider as a kidney tonic.Lower blood pressure - A rat study has noted the Salacia lowered blood pressure.Protects heart – Oblonga has cardioprotection property.Liver protective - it is hepatoprotective, useful for liver related conditions.Inhibits weight gain - thus controls the weight gain. It is much useful for those who are obese and having both diabetes and cholesterol.Traditionally, it has been in use to treat arthritis, diarrhea, fever, gonorrhea, obesity, menstrual problems, and skin diseases.Salacia oblonga lower heart diseases &amp; strokes risksDiabetes has a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease than others do. It is due to slow development of fibrosis, results in increased myocardial stiffness causing ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Salacia oblonga improves interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the hearts and lower your heart disease and stroke risks.Salacia oblonga dosageGeneral recommended dosage for Salacia oblonga is 2.5 to 5.0 grams daily of the whole herb or a comparable amount of extract. The root and bark are the part of the plant used.Salacia oblonga availabilityIt is available in different easy to take forms; they are a Salacia oblonga root, root powder capsules, and extract capsule.Bioactive constituents of Salacia oblongaIt contains two potent a-Glucosidase inhibitors: Salicinol and Kotalanol together with several known phenolic compounds, new sesquiterpenes (salasols A and B) and triterpenes (kotalagenin 16-acetate, salasones A-E, salaquinones A and B). Furthermore, S. reticulata and its phenolic constituents can exhibit pancreatic lipase inhibitory and anti-obese effects.Salacia oblonga side effectsSalacia oblonga is relatively safe. In human, the side effects are similar to the side effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (diabetes medication), gas and cramping.Salacia oblonga may interact with your diabetes medication and causes hypoglycemia.So be vigilant in your blood-glucose monitoring and change your medication dosage if warrants.",https://t.co/sjSvmtz4k8,others

Cinnamon For Diabetes: A Heady Spice To Control Your Blood Sugar Levels,"Known for its cozy fragrance that's a mix of sweet and spicy-hot all at once, cinnamon is a spice-rack staple. But warm and spicy cinnamon can hold the promise of much more than holiday baking – especially if you are diabetic. Known for its strong anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, cinnamon (both Ceylon and cassia varieties) is increasingly being explored as an alternative remedy for diabetes. Here's how the research stacks up in cinnamon's favor.Lowers Blood Sugar Levels And Improves Glycemic ControlAlthough research on the effects of cinnamon on blood sugar is not yet definitive, what has emerged is promising. As a meta-analysis that looked at 8 previous studies showed, cinnamon showed potential in lowering blood sugar in diabetics. When subjects were given either whole cinnamon or a cinnamon extract, it resulted in a significant reduction in fasting blood sugar levels, prompting the researchers to say that cinnamon could be a useful alternative therapy for people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. The type of cinnamon was not specified in this case.While the research on cinnamon's ability to combat diabetes on various fronts is promising, we still need more long-term trials in humans to establish its effectiveness and safety. But studies do show that it has the potential to be a useful add-on therapy in managing type 2 diabetes.Another meta-analysis of 11 studies found similar results. When type 2 diabetics were given cinnamon supplements in doses ranging from 120 to 6,000 mg/day for 4–16 weeks (depending on the study), all studies reported some reduction in fasting blood sugar levels. Of the 11 studies, 7 used cassia cinnamon, 1 used Ceylon cinnamon, while 3 did not specify if Ceylon or cassia cinnamon was used.All 11 studies also reported a positive impact on Hb1Ac levels, a measure which helps indicate what your blood sugar level range has been in the last 2–3 months. When glucose accumulates in the blood, it binds to hemoglobin that is present in the red blood cells (RBCs) and stays bound to these until the RBCs eventually die (after 3 months). Testing for glycated hemoglobin thus gives a good sense of your glucose control over 3 months. The reduction in Hb1Ac levels in all 11 studies indicates that taking cinnamon not only has an immediate impact on sugar levels but may also translate to better glycemic control overall.However, what also needs to be noted is that only 4 of the 11 studies achieved reductions in line with the American Diabetes Association's diabetes treatment goals. There have also been other studies where the results have not been so clear-cut.Mimics Insulin And Boosts Insulin SensitivityWhen you have type 2 diabetes, the body's response to the insulin hormone is compromised. This results in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood. Animal and lab studies have shown that cinnamon can effectively mimic insulin and even make the insulin in the body more efficient. This, in turn, improves insulin sensitivity in the body, helps body cells respond better to insulin, and facilitates smoother glucose transport. Thus cinnamon has potential as an alternative remedy not only for diabetics but also for people with pre-diabetes or who show initial signs of insulin resistance. Human studies confirm this – as one small study found, during two 14-day interventions, when subjects were given 3 gm of cinnamon per day, they saw an improvement in insulin sensitivity and glycemic control.Components like chromium and polyphenols in cinnamon are thought to be responsible for this effect. A chemical compound called methylhydroxychalcone polymer (MHCP) in cinnamon is especially thought to be responsible for its insulin-mimicking activity. Studies show that MHCP has the same biological activity as insulin itself. It increases the uptake of blood sugar by cells and stimulates the synthesis of glycogen.May Lower Blood Sugar Levels After MealsYou may not realize it when you're enjoying a big meal, but your blood sugar levels tend to spike significantly after you've eaten, especially if it is a carbohydrate-heavy meal. These fluctuations in blood sugar levels increase the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes as well as aggravate the condition if you already have it. This is because they increase your body's levels of inflammation and oxidative stress.Some studies indicate that taking cinnamon alongside a carb-heavy meal may slow down the rate at which food empties out of the stomach and helps control spikes in blood sugar levels after a meal. Other studies have suggested that cinnamon may play a role in blocking the digestive enzymes that break down carbohydrates in the small intestine, thereby lowering blood sugar levels after a meal. More extensive human trials are needed to confirm this effect, though.Fights InflammationChronic inflammation is often a major trigger for diabetes and can even lead the way to other health problems if you already have diabetes. Cinnamon helps cut inflammation in the body thanks to its abundance of flavonoids. This anti-inflammatory effect of cinnamon plays a significant role not only in reducing metabolic problems but also in preventing further health complications due to diabetes.Cinnamon's antioxidant benefits also come in handy for diabetics. Not only does oxidative stress, a type of cell damage caused by free radicals, play a role in the onset of diabetes, but diabetics are often more to prone to oxidative stress. Cinnamon's antioxidant effect reduces oxidative stress and breaks this vicious cycle, helping you manage the condition better.Reduces Risk Of Diabetic ComplicationsThanks to its ability to cut inflammation, control uncontrolled sugar levels, and prevent sudden spikes, cinnamon may be able to stop a range of complications associated with diabetes in their tracks.Heart DiseasePeople with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing heart disease. Cinnamon is often recommended as part of an overall heart healthy-diet for preventing coronary artery disease because it is rich in antioxidants and cuts inflammation. Its positive impact on cholesterol levels and blood pressure (as you'll see next) also helps reduce the risk of heart disease and atherosclerosis.Lipid DisordersOne review of studies among type 2 diabetics showed that cinnamon was associated with an average decrease in LDL cholesterol as well as triglycerides. The same analysis also showed a link between cinnamon and an increase in HDL cholesterol.Cinnamon may have an inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for producing cholesterol, thanks to a component called cinnamase. It might thus be a promising alternative remedy for hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, a condition many diabetics struggle with.High Blood PressureCinnamon is increasingly being recognized as a supplementary dietary option to regulate blood pressure levels. As one clinical trial showed, supplementation with cinnamon significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure among people with type 2 diabetes. Cinnamaldehyde, a compound found in cinnamon, helps with the dilation of blood vessels (vasodilatation), which in turn eases high blood pressure.Alzheimer's DiseaseUncontrolled diabetes and the resulting elevated sugar levels in the body can damage many of your organs, including the brain. No wonder that research is uncovering a stronger link between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, AD is increasingly being referred to as type 3 diabetes, with studies suggesting that the condition represents a form of diabetes mellitus that specifically afflicts the brain. Research suggests that cinnamon extract may modulate the activity of beta-amyloid and tau proteins which are routinely linked to the development of AD. While further studies are needed to establish this link, cinnamon's dual action here, against both diabetes and AD, is promising. Which Type of Cinnamon Is Better: Cassia or Ceylon?Cinnamon comes in two varieties – Cassia and Ceylon, both derived from the inner bark of the Cinnamomum tree. Cassia or Chinese cinnamon is generally inexpensive and easily available. This is the type of cinnamon that you are more likely to find in the spice aisle of your supermarket as well as in many food products. Ceylon or true cinnamon is less commonly found than cassia and is typically more expensive. Ceylon cinnamon bark looks like tightly rolled scrolls and is soft and brittle, while cassia cinnamon is hard and thick and has only one roll or curled layer. Ceylon cinnamon is also lighter in color than cassia.Tea is a great – and very refreshing – way to consume cinnamon. For an invigorating cup of cinnamon tea, take a three-inch long cinnamon stick and break it into smaller pieces. Let this steep in 1.5 cups of boiling water for about 15 minutes. Strain the tea and enjoy your healthy cinnamon brew! Cinnamon tea is an especially good way to take cinnamon because the toxic compound coumarin gets left behind in the tea sediment.While studies on diabetes have used both cassia and Ceylon varieties, many researchers don't differentiate between the two or specify which one they have used. Nor has it been established if one type is better than the other when it comes to diabetes management. In all likelihood, both may have similar benefits. But one downside to consider is the high coumarin content in cassia cinnamon. This anticoagulant can even damage the liver when used in large quantities. Ceylon cinnamon, on the other hand, has only negligible traces of this compound. So, while dietary intake of cassia cinnamon (as an ingredient in your food or as seasoning) is fine, it may be a better idea to stick to Ceylon cinnamon for larger therapeutic doses or as supplements. People with liver problems should avoid cassia cinnamon altogether.How Much Cinnamon Should You Take?While a recommended dosage has not been established, most studies typically use between 1 and 6 gm of the powder per day. But remember that coumarin content is a factor you have to be wary of. The European Food Safety Authority has set the tolerable daily intake for coumarin at 0.1 mg/kg. Coumarin content in cassia cinnamon could vary anywhere between 2 and 7 gm per kg. So it would be better to stick to the lower end of the spectrum and have no more than 1 or 2 gm if cassia cinnamon is used.If you are taking medication for diabetes, you must consult your doctor before including cinnamon or cinnamon supplements on a regular basis. It could interact with other medication or cause blood sugar levels to drop drastically (hypoglycemia). Similarly, if you are on other medication such as blood thinners, take your doctor's advice before taking cinnamon supplements. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children should avoid therapeutic doses of cinnamon as its safety in these groups has not been established.

8 Tips to Avoid Blood Sugar Spikes,"Sign Up for Our Living with Diabetes NewsletterThanks for signing up!If you have type 2 diabetes and your blood sugar levels are racing up and down like a roller coaster, it's time to get off the ride. Big swings in your blood sugar can make you feel lousy. But even if you aren't aware of them, they can still increase your risk for a number of serious health problems. By making simple but specific adjustments to your lifestyle and diet, you can gain better blood-sugar control.Your body uses the sugar, also known as glucose, in the foods you eat for energy. Think of it as a fuel that keeps your body moving throughout the day.Blood Sugar Highs and LowsType 2 diabetes decreases the body's production of insulin, which is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Without enough insulin, sugar builds up in the blood and can damage nerves and blood vessels. This increase of blood sugar also increases your risk for heart disease and stroke. Over time, high blood sugar, also known as hyperglycemia, can lead to more health problems, including kidney failure and blindness.""Keeping blood sugar stable can help prevent the long-term consequences of fluctuations,"" says Melissa Li-Ng, MD, an endocrinologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Dr. Li-Ng explains that high blood sugar can cause a number of symptoms that include:FatigueIncreased thirstBlurry visionFrequent urinationIt's also important to know that you can have high blood sugar and still feel fine, but your body can still suffer damage, Li-Ng says.Symptoms of high blood sugar typically develop at levels above 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). ""You can have high blood sugar that's between 150 and 199 and feel perfectly fine,"" Li-Ng says. Over time, your body can also get used to chronically high blood sugar levels, so you don't feel the symptoms, she says.On the flip side, if you're not closely monitoring your blood sugar levels, they can drop too low. Warning signs of low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, include:DizzinessIrritabilitySweatingWeaknessLack of coordinationKeeping Your Blood Sugar SteadyWith certain strategies, you can help prevent spikes in your blood sugar levels, says Toby Smithson, RD, LDN, CDE,a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the founder of DiabetesEveryday.com.Rather than focus on things you shouldn't have, try incorporating the following foods and healthy habits into your daily type 2 diabetes routine:Go nuts. Nuts such as almonds, walnuts, and pistachios contain healthy fat that slows the body's absorption of sugar. But be sure to limit how many nuts you eat in one sitting because even healthy fats contain calories, Smithson says. Just six almonds or four pecan halves have the same number of calories as one teaspoon of butter.Eat whole grains. Oat bran, barley, and rye are fiber-rich foods that contain beta-glucan. This soluble fiber increases the amount of time it takes for your stomach to empty after eating and prevents spikes in blood sugar. Remember, though, that these foods are still carbohydrates. ""Whole grains will still raise your blood sugar, just not as quickly and as high as processed foods,"" Li-Ng says.Veg out. Packed with fiber, non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, cucumber, and carrots can also help prevent surges in blood sugar levels while providing essential nutrients.Spice up with cinnamon. Cinnamon may do more than just add flavor to foods. A 2013 study published in the journal Annals of Family Medicine showed that cinnamon is linked to a significant drop in fasting blood sugar levels. Cinnamon may stimulate insulin secretions from the pancreas,"" Li-Ng says. Although more research is needed, Smithson says there's no reason why people with type 2 diabetes shouldn't try to add cinnamon in their diets.Be versatile with vinegar. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives suggested that vinegar could help slow the absorption of sugar by the body. The research revealed that 2 ounces of apple cider vinegar improved fasting blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. Although the potential health benefits of vinegar are still being investigated, Li-Ng often advises people with type 2 diabetes to take 1 tablespoon of vinegar with each meal, saying that any type of vinegar is good.Don't skip meals. It's important to spread out your daily food intake, starting with breakfast. Consuming more food in just one or two meals a day causes greater fluctuations in blood sugar levels, Li-Ng says. ""Three healthy meals a day with two nutritious snacks in between can help maintain stable blood sugar,"" she says.Don't drink on an empty stomach. If you haven't eaten, drinking alcohol can cause your blood sugar to drop up to 24 hours later. This happens because the body is working to get rid of it. If you want to drink alcohol, check your blood sugar first. It's also important to eat before or while you drink. Another caution: Smithson says that symptoms of low blood sugar, such as slurred speech and dizziness, could be mistaken for drunkenness.Plan ahead. Anticipate the unexpected and carry healthy snacks that can prevent your blood sugar level from dropping too low. Smithson recommends carrying granola bars with you as well as some quick-acting glucose tablets, also known as ""sugar pills.""",https://t.co/FvP8W96Md6,others
Supergirl (TV 2015) [Archive of Our Own],"Chapter Text Kara Danvers was not a squeamish person by any means. At the tender age of thirteen, she'd held her father's throbbing heart steady once the family car had collided with another's during a family picnic trip. Kara's entire family had perished save for her cousin Clark and herself. Clark and Kara had been placed in separate homes. Clark was sent out of state with the Kent's. Meanwhile, she remained in National City, with the Danvers family. The Danvers were a group of esteemed surgeons. Jeremiah had operated on Kara's father and when he saw the blonde haired girl during a visit to the local orphanage, his mind was made up. Kara would be a Danvers. Jeremiah's wife Eliza was equally as warm and welcoming. Unlike Jeremiah who was a cardiothoracic surgeon, Eliza was a neonatal specialist. Ironically, the road to having children hadn't been easy for Jeremiah and Eliza which was why they treasured their daughter Alex so greatly. Alex was wild, reckless, and virulent. But even she fit into the surgeon mold well as a trauma surgeon. She was currently deployed in Afghanistan with her partner Kelly. That left Kara. Fresh out of med school and starting her surgical residency at 8 am sharp that Monday. Only she was running late, all because she'd decided to go out drinking the night before.Kara awoke sluggishly, staring at the shock of dark brown hair beside her. It was the pretty guy at the bar she'd picked up, but she couldn't remember his name. It was already 7:15 am and she hadn't even showered yet. Quickly, she traipsed out of bed and into the shower. A thousand thoughts scurried through her mind as she let the scorching hot water lave her body. Least of which involved her gentleman caller. She hoped she could make her adoptive family proud. Moreover, she hoped she could live up to the expectations she had set for herself. She was going to follow in Jeremiah's footsteps. Hardcore, valiant, and awe-inspiring. She was going to be a cardio-god. Feeling a lot less stressed, Kara stepped out quickly getting ready. By the end of the flurry of movements, she was dressed in a pair of dark slacks, a pink cardigan, and her long blonde hair was pulled in a bun. She finished off the look by putting on her favorite pair of glasses. Kara only used them to read and could have opted for contacts but people somehow tended to take her more seriously if she wore glasses. Old stereotypes, she supposed. It was 7:30 when she exited out of the bedroom. She'd almost forgotten that she had a visitor until she saw him get out of bed with a sheepish smile. He looked even more handsome in the radiant morning sunlight. His eyes were an unusual color. An intermediate of blue and grey, although they currently looked golden because of the sunlight. He had a beard that perfectly framed the architecture of his face. Then there was his physique. It was as if he'd been carved from marble by Michelangelo himself.Definitely not her type. He was too pretty. "" Hi... "" she said awkwardly trying to find a name that fit. "" Mike, "" he seemed amused as he picked up the plaid shirt and donned it. "" I had a good time last night, maybe…""""Kara,"" she interrupted as if to re-introduce herself someone serious. "" Look I don't do this very often and in all honesty I won't have time to do this again because I'm a surgical resident, an intern. My job is to live and breathe medicine.""There was a glint of mischief in his eyes now that Kara found thoroughly infuriating. ""Sounds important."" He said as he put on his pants. "" I guess this…"" he pointed between them, "" isn't gonna happen again.""Kara nodded vehemently. Mike smiled, raking a hand through his hair as he picked up his keys. "" Well in case you change your mind I put my number in your phone,"" he said with a wink as he made his way out.Kara felt herself flush. She waited till she heard the dull thud of the front door before she stalked over to the phone. Picking it up her finger hovered over the delete button when she got to Mike's contact. She looked around suspiciously as if someone might be watching her before she decided to stow it away without deleting the contact info. ——Luthor Presbyterian Hospital was only a short ride from Kara's apartment. Kara had been there dozen of times when Jeremiah and Eliza worked there. Now, they worked at NC General located on the other side of the city. Luthor Pres seemed the perfect place for Kara to grow without being in her adoptive parents' shadow.However, the enmity between the Luthors and the Danvers/Kents was well documented. Kara's biological cousin Clark, a scrappy young reporter, had butt heads with Lex Luthor, the current mayor of Metropolis on more than one occasion.Then there was the well-documented feud between Lillian Luthor and Eliza Danvers over the prestigious Covington Award that is given to a surgeon that makes a significant breakthrough in their field. Both Lillian and Eliza were up for the award and it was a fierce rivalry considering they were both neonatal surgeons. In the end, Eliza won, but Lillian was not so easily defeated. She bought NC Pres and renamed it to Luthor Pres. Eliza and Jeremiah promptly handed in their resignation the day following the sale.There had been some disappointment expressed by Kara's adoptive parents at her decision but on some level they understood. She needed to forge her own path. That was going to be difficult to do when she had her own Luthor to contend with.As soon as Kara had entered the locker room, she could feel Lena's intense gaze on her. They had both attended the same med school but the two of them had never been friends. Still, she could feel Lena on her heels academically. She supposed it would be the same now. Kara walked over to her locker popping it open and pulling out a pair of paisley colored scrubs. Beside her Winn Schott, her best friend was almost glued to his phone. ""Another fantasy baseball draft? "" Kara asked as she walked over to the partitions so she could change. "" You know it,"" Winn said before he looked up at Kara with a smile. "" You look nice today,""Kara shot him a bemused look as she re-appeared dressed in scrubs. Although before she had a chance to answer someone answered for her. ""That's because she got laid,""Barbara Gordon had entered the scene already dressed in her paisley scrubs. Her red hair and big personality were already a stark contrast against the sterile hospital environment. Despite being as different as night and day, along with Winn, she was Kara's best friend. Winn's face seemed to fall when Babs made her proclamation. However, this went unnoticed by the two women. Babs was amused, whilst Kara looked sour."" No need to announce it to the world,"" Kara grumbled. "" Oh, don't be so coy,"" Babs replied unbothered, ""you were all over him last night,"""" Wait, you slept with that guy,"" Winn interjected finally so that both Babs and Kara looked at him. Winn awkwardly coughed. ""Just he doesn't deserve you, he was clearly just looking for sex."""" I'm not marrying the guy."" Kara said pulling out her cross trainers and putting them on, "" I just needed to blow off steam.""Babs nodded in agreement, "" you were pretty tightly wound, how was it? ""Kara blushed, "" I'm not talking about that here.""Babs rolled her eyes before she leaned back against the lockers. She knew her best friend wasn't dropping the issue just reserving it for later. The redhead would be moving into the spare bedroom in Kara's apartment following their first eighteen-hour shift. Kara supposed the reason was that she was once again quarreling with her on-again-off-again boyfriend Dick Grayson. From the beginning, their relationship was ""forbidden,"" due to the fact that Dick was a detective and worked for Barbara's father Jim Gordon the Police Commissioner of National City. That never stopped them. However, problems arose all the time because Dick wanted to lay down roots and Barbara was too much of a free spirit to do so.Kara would never admit it aloud but she was secretly jealous of Barbara. Not because she had feelings for Dick or anything but because she wanted some excitement in her romantic life. She thought back to this morning and her encounter with Mike. Maybe, she owed it to herself to have a fling. Kara's reverie was interrupted by the door to the locker room opening. She stood up without cause looking at the group of people that had entered. The legendary Hank Henshaw stood at the helm. He was the chief of surgery and a man with so many accolades Kara couldn't begin to list them. But her attention wasn't Hank Henshaw at all. It was on the man to the left of him, the one with the alluring grey eyes. The one who was chatting animatedly with a pretty dark haired woman beside him. The man she had woken up with this morning. The man who could end up being her boss.Suddenly, she wished that her life would go back to being boring.",https://t.co/SWT6ulTTmY,others
The effects of cinnamon on blood sugar levels,"Effects of Cinnamon Consumption on Glycemic Indicators, Advanced Glycation End Products, and Antioxidant Status in Type 2 Diabetic PatientsType 2 diabetes is a worldwide problem, as Figure 1 shows. In 2014, the overall global prevalence of diabetes among adults was 8.5%. In North America, it was estimated to be 9.6%.[1] Proper nutrition, maintaining a healthy bodyweight, and exercising can help reduce the risk for developing diabetes, while similar lifestyle habits and pharmaceutical interventions can help manage or treat the disease in people who have it. But is there a role for supplements in diabetes treatment or prevention? Cinnamon is primarily used in cooking, but in some traditions, the spice is used as medication for multiple ailments. In diabetes, cinnamon is thought to work by helping optimize glucose tolerance and lower insulin resistance, or by lowering systemic inflammation, which is also considered a risk factor for metabolic disease and diabetes. In vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that cinnamon has anti-inflammatory[2], antimicrobial[3], and insulin-sensitizing properties, all of which could theoretically help prevent and manage diabetes.However, much of the existing research has involved test tubes and animals. Existing research on the potential effects of cinnamon on glucose tolerance in humans is mixed[4][5]. One of the first human trials to test this effect found that cinnamon supplementation improved blood lipids and glucose in people with diabetes. However, a 2007 study using similar methods was unable to replicate the original results; researchers found no effect of cinnamon supplementation on outcomes. In the study under review, researchers sought to add to the limited literature on the matter by examining the effects of cinnamon supplementation on adults with diabetes. By measuring biomarkers of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as well as markers of antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress, the investigators attempted to measure any beneficial effects of cinnamon in both glucose management and systemic inflammation. Due to a growing worldwide prevalence of diabetes, researchers are interested in applications of natural foods like cinnamon to control blood sugar and curb inflammation. Current research exists in cells and animals showing that cinnamon can help manage diabetes and has anti-inflammatory properties, but more research in humans is still needed. In the study under review, researchers tested the effects of cinnamon supplementation in adults with diabetes.Who and what was studied?This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial involving 44 adult men and women with type 2 diabetes. The participants were on the older end (about 57 years) and overweight (BMI of about 28) on average, but none were obese or had kidney disease, chronic inflammatory diseases, or heart disease. None of the participants had diabetes for more than eight years. The average HbA1c was around 10% and average fasting glucose was about 187 mg/dL (10.4 mmol/L). Researchers performed a power calculation to determine that they needed 40 participants, and enrolled 44 to account for any dropouts. Ultimately, 39 patients, 20 in the experimental group and 19 in the control group, completed the study. Importantly, researchers never reported their predicted effect size for their power calculation, nor did they specify what outcome they used to calculate the power.Enrolled patients were randomized to the experimental group, which received a capsule containing one gram of ground cinnamon (the type was not specified), or to the control group, which received a capsule of the same size, shape, color, and smell filled with microcrystalline cellulose. Participants from both groups were asked not to change their daily eating habits, but to take one of the capsules after each of their primary meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) for eight weeks. Compliance was assessed via pill counts every four weeks.Before and after the eight-week intervention, the researchers measured hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1c, a marker for average blood glucose level for approximately the previous three months), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin, total antioxidant capacity, carboxymethyl lysine (a measure of advanced glycation end-products, or AGEs, and oxidative stress), and malondialdehyde (MDA, another measure of oxidative stress[6]). They used the FPG and fasting insulin values to also calculate insulin sensitivity using the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).There was no mention of primary or secondary outcomes in the study. However, the study's preregistration reports that carboxymethyl lysine, HbA1c, and fasting insulin are considered primary outcomes, along with many other outcomes not reported in this study. No corrections for multiple comparisons were made by the authors.In this randomized-controlled study, 44 eligible participants were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group took a one-gram cinnamon capsule three times daily for eight weeks, while the control group did the same with a placebo. Researchers collected numerous biomarkers, including HbA1c, FPG, fasting insulin, total antioxidant capacity, carboxymethyl lysine, and MDA at baseline and at the eight-week mark. Biomarker results were then compared within and between groups.There was no statistically significant difference between the cinnamon and placebo groups for any outcome over the course of the eight-week study. However, the cinnamon group had a -11.65 mg/dL decrease in FPG while the control group saw a mean 8.57 mg/dL increase. The between-group difference approached significance (p=0.06). Similarly, the average difference in MDA also approached significance (p=0.08) with the cinnamon group seeing a 0.00 μmol/L change and the placebo group seeing a 1.05 μmol/L increase. What does this study really tell us?Overall, the study suggests that cinnamon may not have an effect on type 2 diabetes, at least in the short term. Unfortunately, these results are suggestive at best, since the study had multiple shortcomings, making it hard to be confident in any conclusion drawn from it at all. One major issue has to due with the study's preregistration. There, the authors did not cleanly delineate between primary and secondary outcomes. The preregistration did technically specify these. The problem is that twelve primary and fourteen secondary ones were listed. Listing off so many primary outcomes somewhat defeats the purpose of having them in the first place. Thus, the results of this study should be taken as fairly preliminary and exploratory due to the large amount of variables measured. Another major problem with the study is its use of multiple comparisons. While there were possible promising trends for statistical significance seen for FPG and MDA levels, these become less promising in light of sheer amount of parameters measured. This problem is compounded when the lack of specification for a single, explicit primary outcome is taken into account. A third strike against the results of this study lies in how the paper itself was written. The authors reported that they performed a power calculation to see how many participants were needed in order to see an effect of a certain size. This would normally be a good thing, except that in this case, the authors did not state the effect size they expected to see. This is an essential part of any power calculation. When we did the math using the stated sample size they arrived at, we found that the authors would have had to assume an effect size of 0.91 in order to arrive at the number of participants they reported. This is a very large assumed effect. Thus, the null results found in this study don't tell us much; they only rule out cinnamon having a massive effect. It's quite possible that cinnamon could have a smaller, but still clinically relevant effect, and that this study simply wasn't well-powered enough to see it.These three issues, taken together, imply that this paper unfortunately does not say much about cinnamon's effects in people with diabetes at all. At best, it only rules out cinnamon having a large effect. Future studies should be more focused by specifying a single primary outcome, and would benefit from recruiting a large enough sample to be able to see medium or small effects.Even if the findings from this study are taken at face value (and they probably shouldn't be), it's worth emphasizing that they would only hold for the population enrolled in this study: people with overweight who are not meeting the standard glycemic target of an HbA1C level of less than 7% (recall that the participants' average level was around 10%). The results of this study should not be extrapolated to other populations, such as people with obesity or who have more well-controlled diabetes. Several methodological and reporting issues with this study make it difficult to draw any strong conclusions from it concerning cinnamon supplementation's effects in people with type 2 diabetes. At best, it rules out very large effects. Future studies should recruit more participants and focus on a single primary outcome.This study adds to other inconclusive literature on the effect of cinnamon supplementation in people with type 2 diabetes. A 2007 trial of one gram daily cinnamon supplementation completed by 58 participants with type 2 diabetes for three months found no significant differences in FPG, HbA1c, or fasting insulin levels. The current study had a similar design, included similar participants (many were on metformin in the 2007 group), but tripled the dosage of the cinnamon and shortened the testing period. Ultimately, the higher dosage did not change the outcome in the study under review, although, as discussed in the last section, its lack of results are far from definitive. However, a 2003 study that recruited 60 people with diabetes found significant declines in FPG over 40 days, with similar declines in FPG in experimental groups consuming either one, three, or six grams of supplemental cinnamon per day. This trial, however, included participants who were older and had significantly higher FPG than the groups in the 2007 or trial under review. This speaks to the possibility that cinnamon may have a greater effect in people with poorer blood glucose control or higher levels of oxidative stress. The 2003 study also noted that participants receiving cinnamon supplements showed significant improvements in blood lipids as well. However, repeated studies[7] did not replicate the lipid-lowering effects seen in the trial. Once again, later studies were also done in populations with better diabetic and cholesterol control. Overall, there is not consistent evidence to suggest that cinnamon supplementation has a beneficial effect on cholesterol levels. In a 2012 Cochrane review, independent investigators assembled existing trials on cinnamon supplementation for diabetes to assess the quality of the literature. Of the trials done by the time of publication, researchers examining 10 RCTs found that risk of bias was ""high or unclear"" in eight of the 10 trials. Furthermore, the review did not address the possible effects of cinnamon on oxidative stress, but focused on traditional markers of diabetes including FPG, HbA1c, and insulin sensitivity. Based on these findings, the authors of the Cochrane report stated that cinnamon's effects on FPG were inconclusive, but that there was no statistically significant effect of cinnamon on HbA1c. Though there is limited evidence that cinnamon affects fasting blood glucose or long-term measures of blood glucose levels like HbA1c, there is some trial evidence showing that cinnamon can delay gastric emptying and reduce serum glucose levels after a meal. This could play a role in the mechanism of cinnamon's putative antidiabetic effects, as shown in Figure 2. Cinnamon-induced delayed gastric emptying has been seen in people with BMIs in both the normal and obese range[8]. In both of these trials, participants were given cereal seasoned with six grams of cinnamon. One trial also found that providing 100 mL of cinnamon tea slightly lowered the total blood glucose response to an oral glucose tolerance test in nondiabetic adults. The current state of the science shows no definitive proof that cinnamon capsules will be effective in humans with diabetes, although the quality of the evidence to date is quite low. However, at least one trial showed benefits in people with higher FPG and HbA1c measurements, which suggests that cinnamon may be more beneficial in people with less well-controlled diabetes.Frequently asked questionsWhat is carboxymethyl lysine (CML)?CML is a biomarker for advanced glycation end products (AGEs)[9] which are associated with increased risks for diabetes or for diabetes complications. AGEs are proteins or lipids that become ""glycated"" — sugar becomes stuck to them. The basics of how AGEs form is laid out in Figure 3. These end products are formed during normal metabolism to some degree, but are exacerbated when sugar levels are abnormally high. One of these products is CML, which is known to accumulate faster in people with diabetes. Higher fasting levels of CML are associated with an increased incidence[10] of diabetes. What is malondialdehyde (MDA)?MDA is a marker for oxidative stress. It is an aldehyde[9] that is formed when lipids, specifically polyunsaturated fatty acids, are oxidized. These can sometimes be referred to as advanced lipoxidation end products and are results of free radical[6] events. People with type 2 diabetes have higher levels of MDA than healthy controls. Lowering systemic inflammation and blood sugar control are key components for preventing or managing type 2 diabetes. Cinnamon has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing properties in in vitro and animal studies, as well as lowering postprandial blood glucose in several small, human trials. RCTs attempting to show effects of cinnamon on glucose control in humans have found mixed results. In the study examined above, researchers found no effects from three grams of cinnamon supplementation on FPG, insulin resistance, or measures of oxidative stress compared to participants given a placebo. However, the study had significant limitations in design, reporting, and statistical analysis. Because of this, the study provides no strong evidence about cinnamon's effects on type 2 diabetes. Further study is required.",https://t.co/yaW04kMaz9,others

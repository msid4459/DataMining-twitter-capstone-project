DIABETES - metformin - insulin and what about managing Glucagon in order to avoid HEART ARRHETHMIAS?,"GLUCAGON Changes in your blood sugar levels can affect how you feel. To help you keep the level steady and healthy, your body makes a hormone called glucagon while you sleep and after you eat. It's made in your pancreas, a small organ above your liver, and it can raise levels of glucose, or sugar, in your blood. That's the fuel your muscles and organs use to work and stay healthy. Glucagon helps your liver break down the food you eat to make glucose. If your blood sugar drops too low, you can get hypoglycemia. This can make you feel dizzy or sluggish or even pass out. Glucagon can help with hypoglycemia so you feel right again. Glucagon works with your liver to turn a type of stored sugar called glycogen into glucose. Glucose goes from your liver into your blood to give you energy. Glucagon can tell your liver not to take in too much glucose from the food you eat and to release stored sugar into your blood instead. This can keep your glucose levels steady. If your blood sugar dips too low, your pancreas releases glucagon to tell your liver to make more glucose. Glucagon can also play a role in how amino acids (compounds that help make up muscles and tissue in your body) make glucose. And it can break down triglycerides, or fat your body stores, into fuel. Glucagon and Insulin Glucagon and insulin, the other better known hormone, should work as a team to keep your blood sugar in balance. The cells in your pancreas that make glucagon are similar to cells that make insulin. Your body needs it to turn blood sugar into fuel. If you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make insulin or doesn't make enough. This can change how your body makes glucagon. Usually, food gives your body the sugar and energy it needs. Glucagon levels then go down because your liver doesn't need to make more sugar to fuel your muscles. With diabetes, your pancreas doesn't stop making glucagon when you eat. This can raise your blood sugar levels too much after your meals. You also may make too much glucagon if you've had a sudden weight loss for any reason. It's rare for someone to make too little glucagon, though this sometimes happens in babies. But in elderly people overproduction of Glucagon can influence and damage the nervus vagus and lead to a kind of arrhethmias caused by nerves. This possibility is regurlarly overlooked by the medical providers who are more focussed on high blood pressure and blocked arteries.",https://t.co/SxCTpw5TaZ,news
Glucagon-like Peptide 2 - a Glucose Dependent Glucagonotropic Hormone?,"Glucagon-like Peptide 2 - a Glucose Dependent Glucagonotropic Hormone?Published on BioPortfolio: 2019-05-22T19:56:22-0400Medical and Biotech [MESH] DefinitionsGlucagon-like Peptide 1A peptide of 36 or 37 amino acids that is derived from PROGLUCAGON and mainly produced by the INTESTINAL L CELLS. GLP-1(1-37 or 1-36) is further N-terminally truncated resulting in GLP-1(7-37) or GLP-1-(7-36) which can be amidated. These GLP-1 peptides are known to enhance glucose-dependent INSULIN release, suppress GLUCAGON release and gastric emptying, lower BLOOD GLUCOSE, and reduce food intake.Glucose Clamp TechniqueMaintenance of a constant blood glucose level by perfusion or infusion with glucose or insulin. It is used for the study of metabolic rates (e.g., in glucose, lipid, amino acid metabolism) at constant glucose concentration.InsulinsPeptide hormones that cause an increase in the absorption of GLUCOSE by cells within organs such as LIVER, MUSCLE and ADIPOSE TISSUE. During normal metabolism insulins are produced by the PANCREATIC BETA CELLS in response to increased GLUCOSE. Natural and chemically-modified forms of insulin are also used in the treatment of GLUCOSE METABOLISM DISORDERS such as DIABETES MELLITUS.InsulinA 51-amino acid pancreatic hormone that plays a major role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, directly by suppressing endogenous glucose production (GLYCOGENOLYSIS; GLUCONEOGENESIS) and indirectly by suppressing GLUCAGON secretion and LIPOLYSIS. Native insulin is a globular protein comprised of a zinc-coordinated hexamer. Each insulin monomer containing two chains, A (21 residues) and B (30 residues), linked by two disulfide bonds. Insulin is used as a drug to control insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 1).Glucagon-like Peptide-1 ReceptorA receptor for GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE 1 (GLP-1) expressed primarily on the surface of beta and ductal exocrine cells of the pancreas, as well as cells of other tissues. GLP-1 acts through GLP-1R to potentiate signaling in pancreatic cells in response to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).More From BioPortfolio on ""Glucagon-like Peptide 2 - a Glucose Dependent Glucagonotropic Hormone?""",https://t.co/I9AtMlHCTa,news

"FACTORS INFLUENCING PREFERENCES FOR GLUCAGON DELIVERY DEVICES AMONG PATIENTS WITH DIABETES, CAREGIVERS, AND ACQUAINTANCES","FACTORS INFLUENCING PREFERENCES FOR GLUCAGON DELIVERY DEVICES AMONG PATIENTS WITH DIABETES, CAREGIVERS, AND ACQUAINTANCES Author(s) Bajpai S1, Cambron-Mellott MJ2, Peck E2, Poon JL3, Mitchell B3, Babrowicz J2, Child CJ3, Beusterien K41Eli Lilly and Company, CARMEL, IN, USA, 2Kantar Health, New York, NY, USA, 3Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA, 4Kantar Health, Washington DC, DC, USA OBJECTIVES : People with diabetes (PTs) on insulin are at risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH), a potentially life-threatening event that requires assistance from others. There is significant unmet medical need to improve successful administration of glucagon by caregivers (CGs) and acquaintances (AQs). This study sought to understand perceptions and preferences for two alternate glucagon delivery devices that are currently in development. METHODS : Qualitative interviews were conducted with PTs, CGs and AQs from a general population panel. Interviews focused on aspirational device features and perceptions about the two devices, nasal glucagon (NG) and autoinjector glucagon (AI) - visuals of the instructions for use were shown. Verbatim transcripts were developed, and a thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS : 45 (15 PTs, 15 CGs, and 15 AQs) interviews were conducted. The most frequently spontaneously identified aspirational features for a new glucagon device were ease of use (n=29; 64%), including being uncomplicated, pre-mixed/ready-to-use, and can use quickly; small/easy to carry (n=9; 20%); needle-free/no long needles (n=8; 18%); and easy instructions (n=4; 9%). In general, having a glucagon delivery device on hand would make participants feel prepared, protected and confident that others could assist in the event of SH. More participants across all subgroups preferred NG versus AI (n=33; 73% vs. n=12; 27%). Favorable comments about NG included its ease of use and being needle-free; AI comments included familiarity. There may be more hesitation using AI versus NG because of anxiety about needles and locating an injection site. There was more comfort socially with NG, as it was viewed more discreet and less embarrassing; also, it was considered more child-friendly. CONCLUSIONS : This research suggests that PTs, CGs and AQs prefer a device that is simple and ready to use. NG was generally preferred over an AI primarily because it is less complicated and is needle-free.

School Nurse Breaks A Rule To Save A Life,"Last year, a school nurse in East Moline faced a moral dilemma when a diabetic student lost consciousness in her office. Now she's trying to make sure no other school nurse has to face the same tough choice. Low blood sugar can usually be cured with orange juice and a granola bar. But those snacks and glucose tabs weren't helping the 7th grader sitting in Jennifer Jacobs' office. ""Her blood sugar kept falling, and we kept pushing the snacks,"" Jacobs says. Jacobs is a nationally certified school nurse with 30 years of experience — 17 of those at Glenview Middle School. She was on her lunch break when the student came in, so Jacobs' assistant, a licensed practical nurse, started treatment. ""Within probably five or 10 minutes of my returning from lunch,"" Jacobs says, ""the student fell on the floor. [She] wasn't seizing but was tremoring, and her eyes were rolling back in her head…"" Jacobs applied glucose gel inside the student's cheek, but the meds just slid out of her mouth in a stream of drool. The student was crashing. ""It was beyond anything that we could do,"" Jacobs says. Well, it was beyond anything they could do legally. But Jacobs and her assistant both knew there was one more medication, made specifically for such emergencies, right there within reach. It's a hormone called glucagon. Once injected, it can help a diabetic recover from a crash, by stimulating the release of stored glucose. The problem was: The only glucagon kit in the office belonged to another diabetic student — not to the 7th grader drooling on the floor. Could they use that glucagon to treat this student? To Jacobs, that wasn't the right question. ""In my mind, I'm thinking, well I could lose my RN license for this. I could lose everything. I'm putting the school district at a huge liability risk. I mean, it could've been hugely detrimental,"" she says. ""But how do you not do this to save the girl's life? How do you not? It just comes down to that. How do you not?"" The only other option was simply unthinkable. ""The progression for untreated severe hypoglycemia would be seizures and to stop breathing and to die,"" she says. Jacobs made a split-second decision. She grabbed the glucagon and injected the student. Paramedics arrived and had to administer a second dose of glucagon en route to the hospital. ""This girl was crashing so severely that the one I administered wasn't even affecting her,"" Jacobs says. ""Think what would've happened if I hadn't used that one. That gives me goosebumps. That makes me nauseous."" She had urged the girl's family to provide a glucagon kit. The student was ""a very brittle diabetic,"" Jacobs says, meaning her blood sugar levels tended take sudden swings. But such severe hypoglycemic episodes are relatively rare. In fact, this incident was the first time Jacobs had to give anyone glucagon in her 30-year career. So she understands why the family hadn't gotten around to providing glucagon. ""There are so many reasons, so many obstacles,"" Jacobs says. ""When you're talking about buying all the supplies needed by a diabetic to manage their diabetes, the cost is astronomical. And this family not only had their 7th grade daughter but they have an 8th grade son and the father and the mother all have diabetes. Three of the four are insulin-dependent."" Jacobs called the other student's family immediately, and the school district replaced their child's glucagon the next day. The girl who experienced the hypoglycemic crash made a full recovery. But for Jacobs, that's not a happy enough ending. She persuaded her state representative — Democrat Michael Halpin, of Rock Island — to file legislation allowing schools to buy glucagon and keep it on hand. ""It just makes sense,"" she says. ""We have a school-provided inhaler for students that have severe asthmatic reactions. And schools have EpiPens for severe allergic reactions. And we have Narcan to be used for opioid overdoses."" Halpin's bill has cleared the House and is set to be heard in the Senate. It's gotten unanimous approval at each step of the legislative process, so lawmakers apparently agree with the decision Nurse Jacobs made that day. As she would say: How could you not?",https://t.co/5u0O3kEGIs,news
Faculdade de Medicina - Universidade de Coimbra,"(Foto: Patrícia Borges, Salomé Pires, Raquel Seiça, Margarida Abrantes, Paulo Matafome, Tiago Rodrigues, Laura M, Beatriz Almeida e Sónia Silva) O trabalho Modulação da glioxalase-1 pelo GLP-1: impacto na capilarização e sensibilidade à insulina do tecido adiposo, desenvolvido por investigadores dos Institutos de Fisiologia, Farmacologia e Biofísica da FMUC, em colaboração com a equipa coordenada pelo Dr. Pedro Gomes, do Serviço de Cirurgia do Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra (Covões) recebeu a distinção de Melhor comunicação oral em investigação fundamental e o Prémio SPD/Medinfar Diabetes 2019 (ex aequo) para o melhor trabalho apresentado no congresso.Os prémios foram atribuídos no último Congresso Português de Diabetes, que decorreu recentemente, em Vilamoura.Objectivos e conclusões do estudo: Foi demonstrado que a glicação altera a capilarização do TA em ratos obesos, contribuindo para a desregulação metabólica na obesidade. A hipótese deste estudo foi que a diminuição da actividade da enzima glioxalase-1 (GLO-1) no tecido adiposo pudesse correlacionar-se com a resistência à insulina em doentes obesos, podendo constituir um alvo terapêutico na obesidade e diabetes tipo 2. Uma vez que a cirurgia bariátrica (gastrectomia vertical) melhora a angiogénese do tecido adiposo e os níveis pós-prandiais de GLP-1, foi também colocada a hipótese que este poderia regular a actividade da GLO-1, favorecendo a angiogenése do TA. Este estudo permitiu demonstrar que a diminuição da actividade da GLO-1 no tecido adiposo associa-se a resistência à insulina e pode ser um alvo do GLP-1 de forma a promover a capilarização do tecido e a sensibilidade à insulina. Estes mecanismos poderão constituir uma nova abordagem no tratamento da desregulação metabólica da obesidade e diabetes tipo 2.Autores: Rodrigues T.1, Borges P.1, Carrêlo C.1, Mar L.1, Eickhoff H.2, Almeida B.3, Marques D.1, Pires S.4, Abrantes M.4, Martins B.5, Uriarte C.6, Gomes P.6, Silva S.7, Seiça R.1, Matafome P.81 - Instituto de Fisiologia e Instituto de Investigação Clínica e Biomédica de Coimbra (iCBR), Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Coimbra (FMUC), Coimbra 2 - Instituto de Fisiologia e iCBR, FMUC, Centro de Obesidade, Hospital de Santiago, Setúbal, Coimbra/Setúbal 3 - Associação Protectora dos Diabéticos de Portugal (APDP), Lisboa 4 - Instituto de Biofísica e iCBR, FMUC, Coimbra 5 - iCBR, FMUC, Coimbra 6 - Departamento de Cirurgia, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra, Coimbra 7 - iCBR, FMUC, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra 8 - Instituto de Fisiologia e iCBR, FMUC, Instituto Politécnico de Coimbra, Coimbra Health School (ESTeSC), Coimbra",https://t.co/26DbPXOICL,news

A Closer Look at Glucagon,"""Contrary to popular belief, insulin is not needed for glucose uptake and utilization in man.""(Manninen, 2004)In a world where we learn the primary function of insulin is to facilitate cellular glucose uptake, the statement above is nothing short of revolutionary. Indeed, though, as the author goes on to say:""Contrary to popular belief supported by the leading physiology and biochemistry textbooks, there is sufficient population of glucose transporters in all cell membranes at all times to ensure enough glucose uptake to satisfy the cell's respiration, even in the absence of insulin. Insulin can and does increase the number of these transporters in some cells but glucose uptake is never truly insulin dependent.""This might shock many people, especially those living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. But it's true: most glucose transporters do not require insulin to take glucose into cells. GLUT4, the most abundant glucose transporter in adipose tissue, skeletal and cardiac muscles, is insulin-sensitive and its translocation to the cell membrane is stimulated by insulin, but it can also participate in non-insulin mediated glucose uptake, such as during physical activity. (In fact, exercise is the most potent stimulus for increased skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression.) So why, then, do most people—including many medical and nutrition professionals—think of insulin primarily as a ""blood sugar hormone?""There's no doubt that insulin does play a primary role in regulating blood glucose, but not for the reason we usually think. As mentioned, glucose uptake in the body is never truly dependent on insulin. The main role of insulin in gluco-regulation may be to counteract the effects of glucagon. And with about 88% of people surveyed last year meeting criteria for being ""metabolically unhealthy,"" and most of this stemming from metabolic syndrome or chronically high insulin, there's a good reason insulin and insulin resistance garner the lion's share of health headlines. But what about glucagon, an insulin counter-regulatory hormone?Glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells in the pancreas, and it has opposite effects to those of insulin: whereas insulin inhibits lipolysis and ketogeniesis (the breakdown of fats and generation of ketones, respectively), glucagon stimulates these. Insulin is anti-catabolic; glucagon is catabolic. We can see this in the way individuals with untreated type 1 diabetes (T1D) waste away: this is the effect of glucagon run amok when insulin is absent or insufficient for keeping it in check. As Dr. Roger Unger, an expert in this field, wrote: ""the catabolic actions heretofore considered the direct consequences of insulin lack are actually mediated by a relative or absolute excess of glucagon to insulin.""Whereas insulin lowers blood glucose (BG) in the postprandial or fed state, glucagon raises BG in the fasted state, whether that means during a long term fast or simply overnight or for long spans between meals when food hasn't been consumed for several hours. It does this by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. It can also catabolize muscle proteins to generate glucose from amino acids, which explains the wasting seen in untreated T1D. Hyperglycemia—particularly in the case of T1D but also possibly in individuals with insulin resistance—does not necessarily result from an inability of cells to take up glucose, but rather, from uncontrolled hepatic production and release of glucose: ""The use of tracer glucose infusions has shown not only that hyperglycaemia in the face of insulin deficiency is the result of over-production of glucose by the liver but also that insulin infusion lowers blood glucose by inhibiting hepatic glucose production.""A paper published after the one cited above corroborates:""When insulin is administered to people with diabetes who are fasting, blood glucose concentrations falls. It is generally assumed that this is because insulin increases glucose uptake into tissues. However, this is not the case and is just another metabolic legend arising from in vitro rat data. It has been shown that insulin at concentrations that are within the normal physiological range lowers blood glucose through inhibiting hepatic glucose production."" (Manninen, 2004)Hyperglycemia, or even a normal rise in BG such as occurs after a meal, normally elicits an increase in insulin in order to lower the BG, and the presence of insulin suppresses glucagon secretion. When insulin is absent, however, as in T1D, or when pancreatic alpha cells are not responding to insulin properly (as may occur in T2D), the elevation of BG stimulates glucagon secretion: ""This adds an endogenous source of glucose to the exogenous glucose from the meal."" No wonder BG is so high postprandially in those with T1 or T2D—even higher than would be expected solely from the carbohydrate content of a meal.Beyond control of BG, stimulating lipolysis and ketogenesis, and inhibiting fatty acid synthesis, glucagon crosses the blood-brain barrier and appears to regulate appetite and satiety via effects in the central nervous system. (Evidence indicates a small amount of glucagon synthesis occurs within the brain stem as well, and some is also produced in the eneteroendocrine L-cells of the intestinal mucosa.) It has also been shown to enhance metabolic rate through activation of brown adipose tissue and inducing a thermogenic effect. For these reasons, glucagon action is an attractive target for drugs and other therapies intended for fat loss. Some overlaps between glucagon and GLP-1 action may explain the modest weight loss observed in people with or without T2D treated with GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs. Individuals on low-carb or ketogenic diets sometimes fear the glucose-raising effects of glucagon. However, gluconeogenesis (GNG) in the context of a low-carb or ketogenic diet is different from that which occurs on a high-carb diet or, more specifically, when hepatic glycogen is full: ""The hyperglycemic property of glucagon is further enhanced when hepatic glycogen levels are high and diminished when glycogen levels are low, such as in fasted animals, diabetic animals with ketosis, or patients with liver cirrhosis.""Of course, one need not fast, nor have diabetes or cirrhosis in order for hepatic glycogen to be low. This occurs naturally on low-carb or ketogenic diets, and since the body and brain always need some glucose, even on a strict ketogenic diet, keto dieters can thank glucagon for keeping them alive and helping their brain fire on all cylinders. In the context of a low-carb or keto diet, GNG doesn't typically cause hyperglycemia; it merely maintains BG within a healthy range, preventing it from falling to dangerously low levels. People following low-carb diets for fat loss or blood glucose control need not fear glucagon-induced GNG causing chronically elevated BG and the undesirable metabolic sequelae that would result. The context of glucose appearing in the blood is entirely different than on a high-carb diet with hepatic glycogen fully replete. (Ben Bikman, PhD, a researcher focused on insulin and well known in the ketogenic community, gave an informative talk on this topic in 2018: Insulin vs. Glucagon: The relevance of dietary protein.)Glucagon is a fascinating hormone with powerful influences on several areas of interest, including types 1 and 2 diabetes, fat loss, appetite regulation and more.

REMD2.59 treatment blunted cardiac hypertrophy and fibrotic remodeling, and attenuated contractile dysfunction at 4 weeks after myocardial infarction. In addition, REMD2.59 treatment at the onset of pressure overload significantly suppressed cardiac hypertrophy and chamber dilation with marked preservation of cardiac systolic and diastolic function. Initiation of REMD2.59 treatment 2 weeks after pressure overload significantly blunted the progression of cardiac pathology. These results provide the first in vivo proof-of-concept evidence that glucagon receptor antagonism is a potentially efficacious therapy to ameliorate both onset and progression of heart failure.Key WordsHeart failure affects approximately 6.5 million people over 20 years of age in the United States, with its prevalence estimated to increase about 45% by 2030 to almost 8 million (1). It is a chronic disease with complex etiology and heterogeneity in its pathological manifestations. Major risk factors for heart failure include smoking, hypertension, and obesity, as well as lifestyle and dietary influences. Despite significant advancement in the standard care of heart failure, the 5-year mortality rate of the disease remains at nearly 50% (1). The new effective therapies for heart failure are critically needed for such a major unmet need.Glucagon (GLC) is a peptide hormone produced by pancreatic α-cells (2–6). As a major catabolic hormone, GLC stimulates glucose production from glycogen in liver and promotes gluconeogenesis while it inhibits glycolysis and glycogen synthesis (4). It increases blood glucose and energy expenditure as part of the energy mobilization process in response to hypoglycemia and other bioenergetic stress. Consequently, GLC serves as a counterbalancing hormone with insulin to regulate glucose homeostasis depending on nutrient conditions and available energy sources (7). The GLC receptor (GCGR) is a member of the G protein–coupled receptor family (3,6,8,9). The canonical function of GCGR elicited by GLC is mediated by G protein–coupled protein kinase A activation; however, tissue-specific function of GCGR has been implicated in different cellular processes (2,3,10). Elevated GLC is observed in chronic hyperglycemia associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (11–13). Overactivated GLC signaling may contribute to disease progression of diabetes by enhancing glucose production and aggravating systemic hyperglycemia, as well as impairing insulin signaling. Therefore, GCGR inhibition, using either small molecules or antagonistic antibodies, is potentially efficacious to treat diabetes as demonstrated in both preclinical studies as well as several recent clinical trials (11–21). However, much of the previous studies on GLC signaling are in the liver and brain, involving glucose metabolic regulation (2,3,22). Its specific and cell-autonomous role in cardiac tissue has just begun to be appreciated.Other than glucose regulation in liver, GCGR is also widely expressed in multiple other tissues, including the heart (3,15,18,23–28). In a recent study by Ali et al. (29), GLC stimulation was shown to promote ischemia injury in mouse heart while cardiomyocyte specific GCGR inactivation protected the heart from pathological remodeling following myocardial infarction. This study highlights the potential cardiomyocyte cell-autonomous effect of GCGR overactivation in cardiac pathological remodeling, and GCGR antagonism as a potential therapy for heart failure. REMD-477 is a fully human anti-GCGR antibody that competitively blocks GLC binding to the GCGR with 30-pM binding affinity, and can effectively inhibit the receptor activity at low nanomolar concentrations in cell-based functional assays (14,17,20). Compared with small-molecule approaches (30), antibody-based GCGR antagonism such as REMD-477 is a competitive antagonist and does not have deleterious effects on serum lipid profiles (11,12,19,21,31). Finally, REMD-477 has been shown to be safe in a phase I study (NCT02715193) and is being tested in 2 phase II clinical studies (NCT03117998 and NCT02455011 for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively). In short, anti-GCGR antibody offers a novel tool to effectively and specifically inhibit GCGR with proven record of clinical safety and efficacy at molecular and metabolic levels.Functionally identical as REMD-477, REMD2.59 is a surrogate human antibody specifically generated for preclinical studies in rodents (32). In a recent study, weekly treatment with REMD2.59 is shown to reverse diabetes in ob/ob mice and improves cardiac function associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy (32). Although this study supports the cardioprotective effect of GCGR antagonism, it is not clear whether the beneficial effect is a direct consequence of cardioprotection on cardiomyocyte or an indirect result of improved global glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling. In the current study, we employed 2 mechanistically divergent and diabetes-independent murine disease models for heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pressure overload, to test whether the cardioprotection by the GCGR antibody is the primary effect of the receptor inhibition. Based on morphological, functional, and molecular parameters, treatment with GCGR antibody REMD2.59 significantly ameliorated the development of heart failure, by attenuating pathological remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy while preventing functional deterioration and pathological gene expression. These novel and exciting observations implicate a potential role of GLC-mediated signaling in heart failure via a cardiomyocyte cell-autonomous mechanism. It raises the prospect of targeting GCGR as potential therapy to treat common forms of heart failure independent of the confounding status of global glucose metabolic disorders.MethodsAnimalsC57BL/6 male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) were used in this study, and all mice were housed in groups of 4 to 5 mice per cage in a room maintained at 23 ± 1°C and 55 ± 5% humidity with a 12-h light-dark cycle and given ad libitum access to food and water.Myocardial infarctionMyocardial infarction (MI) was induced in mice by ligation of the left anterior coronary artery. Briefly, the chest was opened via a left thoracotomy. The left coronary artery was identified visually using a stereo microscope, and a 7-0 suture (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, New Jersey) was placed around the artery 1 to 2 mm below the left auricle. The electrocardiogram was monitored continuously. Permanent occlusion of the left coronary artery resulted from its ligation with the suture. Myocardial ischemia was confirmed by pallor in heart color and ST-segment elevation. The chest was closed with 6-0 silk suture. Once spontaneous respiration resumed, the endotracheal tube was removed.Transaortic constrictionIn the transaortic constriction (TAC) study, after intubation using a 20-gauge plastic needle, mice were placed on a volume ventilator (80 breaths/min, 1.2 ml/g/min) and the anesthesia maintained by isoflurane. The chest was opened via a limited incision in the third intercostal space. The aorta was identified at the T8 region. A 6-0 silk suture was passed around the transverse aorta and tightened against a 27-gauge needle followed by the removal of the needle. Pressure gradient was evaluated by transaortic Doppler.Treatment protocolFor the MI study, a total of 56 C57BL/6 male mice 8 to 10 weeks of age were operated on by occluding the left anterior coronary artery. Then they were randomly divided into 3 groups: 1) vehicle-treated (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) control mice (n = 20); 2) monoclonal antibody against GCGR–treated (mAb REMD2.59) mice (n = 18; 7 mg/kg, subcutaneously, 2 injections at 2 h and 14 days post-MI); and 3) GLC-treated mice (n = 18; 30 μg/kg body weight in 10% gelatin, 4 times/day for the first 6 days). For the TAC study, C57BL6 mice at 6 to 7 weeks of age were randomly divided into 2 groups: 5 sham operated as baseline control mice and 29 mice operated for TAC. The TAC-operated animals were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: 1) vehicle treated (n = 11; antibody dilation buffer A: 10-mM NaAcetate, 5% sorbitol, 0.004% Tween 20, pH 5.2, weekly subcutaneous injection); 2) REMD2.59 treated (n = 7; 7 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection, weekly started at the onset of TAC); and 3) REMD2.59 therapy (n = 11; 7 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection, weekly started 2 weeks after the onset of TAC).Cardiac physiologyFor echocardiography, in vivo cardiac function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (Acuson P300, 18-MHz transducer, Siemens [Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, New York] and VisualSonics 2100 [Fujifilm Visualsonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada]) in conscious mice for the MI study and anesthetized mice for the TAC study. From left ventricle short-axis view, an M-mode echocardiogram was acquired to measure left ventricular end-systolic and diastolic diameters. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening were calculated using onboard software package (Vevo Imaging System 2100 [Fujifilm Visualsonics]). Imaging acquisition and analyses were performed by investigators blinded to treatments. For hemodynamic measurements, a Mikro-tip catheter (SPR1000, Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas) was inserted into the left ventricle. Left ventricular pressure was recorded with the Powerlab Data Acquisition System (ADInstruments Inc., Colorado Springs, Colorado) and calculated into left ventricular developed pressure as end-systolic pressure minus end-diastolic pressure, as well as positive maximal left ventricular pressure derivative (+dp/dtmax) and negative maximal left ventricular pressure derivative (−dp/dtmax) using Chart 7 software (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, Colorado).Histological studiesHearts were fixed with 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4 μm. One middle longitudinal section per heart was stained with Masson's trichrome (HT-15, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri). Eight randomly selected fields (400×) from the noninfarct area in the left ventricle were examined for fibrosis and myocyte size under a microscope. Each group comprised 5 to 6 hearts, and a minimum of 40 fields were analyzed in each group by computerized planimetry (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland). To assess fibrosis, fibrotic blue area and whole myocardial area were measured. The fibrotic area was presented as a percentage of fibrotic area to the myocardial area. Myocyte size was measured in cross-sectioned muscle cells. In total, 100 to 150 cells/heart were analyzed based on wheat germ agglutinin staining. Two methods were used to assess the size of the infarcted heart. Infarct area was calculated as a percentage of infarcted ventricular area to total ventricular area using the front and back sides of the heart photos. Infarct size was measured as a percentage of infarcted ventricular wall length to total ventricular wall length using cardiac sections. The observer was blinded to the origin of the cardiac sections.TUNEL assay was performed with the In-Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). Briefly, hearts were fixed by perfusion with 10% formalin solution, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 6 μm. One middle longitudinal section per heart was taken for TUNEL staining. Proteinase K (20 μg/ml) was added to each slide. Endogenous peroxidases were inactivated by covering sections with 2% hydrogen peroxide. After fixation, sections were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase buffer at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated with 1× saline-sodium citrate buffer. After being washed, slides were incubated with RTU streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase for 30 min. Positive signal was developed by adding DAB solution. After counterstained with RTU hematoxylin, slides were covered by mounting medium and analyzed under a microscope. Each group comprised 5 to 6 hearts. Eight fields (400×) from the infarct area per heart were analyzed for positive cells and total cells using computerized planimetry (ImageJ). The degree of apoptosis was presented as a percentage of positive cells to total cells.Real-time polymerase chain reaction1 μg RNA was used for first-strand complementary DNA synthesis using Random Primer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and SuperScriptII Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer's instruction. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California) with CFX-96 Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with primers as described in Table 1.Table 1 Reverse-Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Primer OligonucleotidesStatistical analysis methodsWe used student Wilcoxon rank sum test or analysis of variance to perform statistical analysis between 2 groups or among multiple groups, and a p value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. The specific p values are depicted in the figures according to the following symbols, unless specified in individual figure legend: # indicates p &lt; 0.05, * indicates p &lt; 0.01, ** indicates p &lt; 0.001.ResultsGCGR antagonism attenuates MI-induced cardiac remodelingEight-week to 10-week-old C57BL/J6 male mice were operated by permanent occlusion of left coronary artery descending artery and then randomized into 3 experimental groups, which were treated with PBS (control group; subcutaneous injection twice at 2 h, and 14 days post-MI) or monoclonal anti-GCGR antibody REMD2.59 (REMD group; subcutaneous injection of 7 mg/kg twice at 2 h and 14 days post MI) and GLC (GLC group; subcutaneous injection of 30 μg/kg 4 times/day for the first 6 days), as illustrated in Figure 1A. REMD2.59 treatment modestly but significantly reduced fasting blood glucose level, indicating the expected GLC antagonistic effect of REMD2.59 in mice (Figure 1B). As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, in the vehicle-treated control group, histopathology analysis at the end of the experiment period of 4 weeks post-MI showed approximately 39% infarct scar size relative to total heart size. In contrast, the REMD-treated heart showed an average of 32% scar area and GLC-treated hearts showed an average of 48% scar area. Although GLC-treated hearts trended to have larger infarct sizes and REMD-treated hearts trended to smaller infarct sizes, the differences did not reach statistical significance, indicating that myocardium sparing may not be the major basis of protection GCGR effects in the post-MI hearts. The REMD2.59-treated heart showed a significant reduction in the apoptotic events detected by TUNEL (Figures 2C and 2D) as well as the level of myocardial fibrosis measured by trichrome staining (Figures 2E and 2F). However, the cellular identities of the apoptotic cells remain to be determined. Finally, REMD2.59 treatment also significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy versus the vehicle-treated group based on heart weight (Figure 3A), or myocyte cross-sectional area measurements (Figure 3B). However, treatment of unoperated mice with REMD2.59 for 2 weeks did not affect basal heart weight (Figure 3C). These data support the notion that GCGR antagonism can prevent and attenuate the onset of pathological remodeling in response to myocardial injury, by reducing fibrosis and attenuating cardiomyocyte pathological hypertrophy.Figure 1 Glucagon and Glucagon Receptor Antagonism in Myocardial Infarction(A) Illustration of experimental design to investigate the effect of glucagon (GLC) and REMD2.59 treatment on myocardial infarction (MI).

Abbreviations as in Figure 1.GCGR antagonism preserves cardiac function after MIIn addition to morphological and histological analysis, we measured cardiac function in each experimental group by both noninvasive echocardiogram and catheter based hemodynamic analysis. As shown in Figures 4A and 4B, a serial echocardiogram showed progressive deterioration of systolic function from 26% fractional shortening at week 1 to 16% at week 4 after MI in the vehicle-treated mice. In contrast, the REMD2.59 treatment almost completely preserved cardiac function from 30% fractional shortening at week 1 to 38% at week 4. In contrast, the mice treated with GLC showed earlier contractile dysfunction than the vehicle-treated group, losing fractional shortening from 26% at week 1 to 17.9% at week 1 after MI. Consistent with the impact on systolic function, significant chamber dilation was observed in the vehicle- and GLC-treated groups, which was almost completely blunted by REMD2.59 treatment (Figure 4B). Using catheter-based invasive hemodynamic measurements (Figures 4C–E), we observed that REMD2.59 treatment significantly elevated left ventricular developed pressure, and systolic pressure and improved both systolic (+dP/dtmax; p &lt; 0.05) and diastolic (–dP/dtmax; p = 0.06) parameters in the post-MI hearts compared with the vehicle-treated control mice. These data suggest that GCGR inhibition can prevent loss of cardiac function in post-MI hearts. It is noted that the mice from hemodynamic studies had average heart rates (378 ± 94 beats/min, 363 ± 71 beats/min, 431 ± 114 beats/min for vehicle-, REMD-, and GLC-treated groups, respectively). In contrast, the average heart rates of mice for the echocardiograph studies were 626 ± 18 beats/min, 657 ± 9 beats/min, and 662 ± 7 beats/min for the same groups, respectively. Therefore, the hemodynamic measurements were measured under a significantly depressed state, likely due to anesthesia. Nevertheless, there were no differences in heart rates among the 3 experiment groups in either measurements, suggesting that the differences observed in the hemodynamic or echocardiographic parameters were not the results of differential degrees of anesthesia levels.Figure 4 Impact of GLC and GLC Receptor Antagonist on Cardiac Function and Chamber Dilation in Post-Myocardial Heart(A) Fractional shortening and (B) left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD) in MI hearts treated with PBS (Control; n = 10, blue), GLC (n = 6, purple), and GLC receptor antagonist (REMD; n = 11; red) at different time points recorded by echocardiogram. #p &lt; 0.05 REMD versus Control; REMD versus GLC.

Abbreviations as in Figure 1.GCGR inhibition on pressure overload–induced cardiac hypertrophyTo demonstrate the applicability of GCGR antagonism therapy to heart failure with different etiologies, we investigated the impact of REMD2.59 on pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy, dysfunction, and remodeling. Pressure overload was induced by TAC as described previously (33,34) in C57BL/6 male mice 8 to 10 weeks of age followed by weekly treatment of vehicle or anti-GCGR antibody (REMD2.59, 7 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneous injection) starting at the same time or starting at 2-weeks post TAC (REMD2.59 therapy) (Figure 5). Compared with the sham-operated group, TAC induced a significant increase in heart sizes as demonstrated in histological sections of the left ventricle, and tissue weights and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional morphometric data of cardiac chamber weight and the left ventricle (Figure 6). Concurrent treatment with REMD2.59 significantly blunted the increase of heart weight and myocyte enlargement compared with the TAC group. In contrast, starting REMD2.59 treatment at 2 weeks post-TAC (REMD2.59 therapy) failed to block left ventricular hypertrophy. These data indicate that GCGR inhibition can prevent the onset of cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload, but has limited effect to reverse established cardiac hypertrophy.Figure 5 Glucagon and Glucagon Antagonism in Pressure-Overload Induced Cardiac HypertrophyIllustration of treatment regiments for pressure overload–induced heart failure by GLC receptor antagonist either at the onset of the transaortic surgery (transaortic constriction [TAC] + REMD) or 2 weeks after (TAC + REMD therapy).

Abbreviations as in Figures 1, 3, and 5.GCGR inhibition in pressure overload–induced cardiac dysfunctionUsing serial echocardiogram analysis, we found cardiac function, as measured from ejection fraction and percent fractional shortening, was significantly impaired by chronic pressure overload as early as 2 weeks post-TAC and deteriorated further at 5 weeks post-TAC (Figure 7), along with pulmonary congestion (Figure 6B). Treating mice with REMD2.59 at the onset of pressure overload largely preserved the contractile function in the pressure-overloaded hearts with ejection fraction and percent fractional shortening statistically unchanged comparing with the sham-operated mice at 5 weeks post-TAC (Figure 7). Starting REMD2.59 treatment 2 weeks after TAC, when functional impairment had already manifested, blunted further deterioration comparing to the vehicle-treated group. Using speckle tracking–based tissue-strain analysis from echocardiographic images (Figure 8), we observed that REMD2.59 treatment from the onset of TAC prevented the pressure overload–induced systolic and diastolic dysfunction as demonstrated in both systolic strain and diastolic strain rate. In contrast, REMD2.59 treatment starting 2 weeks post-TAC had limited success to reverse these parameters. The cardioprotective effect of REMD2.59 treatment was also manifested in significantly blunted pulmonary congestion (Figure 6B). All these evidences suggest that GCGR antagonism exerts significant protection against pressure overload induced cardiac dysfunction and blunts progression of heart failure.Figure 7 Functional Impact of GLC Receptor Antagonist on Contractile Function Measured by Echocardiogram(A) Ejection fraction and (B) fractional shortening were measured at basal (week 0), 2 weeks post-TAC (week 2) and 5 weeks post-TAC from each treatment group as indicated. *p &lt; 0.05 TAC versus TAC + REMD; #p &lt; 0.05 TAC versus TAC + REMD therapy.

REMD2.59 treatment started either at the onset of pressure overload or 2 weeks post-TAC completely blocked these changes. Therefore, GCGR inhibition can significantly block pathological remodeling in stressed heart in terms of extracellular matrix remodeling or gene expression.Figure 9 Impact of GLC Receptor Antagonist on Pathological Remodeling(A) Representative images of trichrome-stained tissue section from hearts of different experimental groups as indicated.

Abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 5.DiscussionIn this report, the therapeutic effect of a GCGR antagonistic antibody REMD2.59 was tested in 2 mechanistically divergent disease models of heart failure without confounding defects in global metabolism. Based on histological and functional analyses in both MI-injured and pressure-overloaded hearts, REMD2.59 treatment showed significant protection against cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis remodeling with better preserved contractile function. These findings support a broadly applicable cardioprotective effect of GCGR inhibition against heart failure with different etiologies. As both these pathological stressors are imposed specifically and directly on heart rather in a systemic fashion, the observed cardioprotection of REMD2.59 is likely the result of its direct impact on GCGR signaling in cardiomyocytes rather than its impact on global glucose metabolic activities. This observation is consistent with the previous observations made in the cardiomyocyte-specific GCGR knockout mice, which have demonstrated the cardioprotective effect of GCGR antagonism against myocardial infarction in a receptor-dependent and cardiomyocyte cell-autonomous manner (29,32).GLC and insulin are both pancreatic but counterbalancing hormones important to maintain systemic glucose regulation. GLC exerts its function via a peptide G protein–coupled receptor, GCGR. The canonical GCGR-mediated signaling involves classic G protein–coupled cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activation in hepatocytes, leading to induction of gluconeogenesis and glycogen catabolism, while inhibiting glycolysis (7,35). In addition to its predominant expression in liver, GCGR is also expressed at modest to low levels in the kidney, heart, pancreas, and many other tissues (3,8,36). Although G protein–coupled canonical signaling for GLC is well established in hepatocytes, other mechanisms involving intracellular calcium regulation have also been reported in nonhepatocytes including cardiomyocytes (3,10,28,36). In this report, we investigated GCGR inhibition in 2 mechanistically divergent disease models (i.e., myocardial infarction vs. pressure overload), the treatment resulted in similar cardioprotective effects against a broad spectrum of sequential pathological features in the failing heart, including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, marker gene induction, interstitial fibrosis, and most importantly, cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction. Apparently, GCGR antagonism is affecting cellular processes shared by different etiologies of cardiac pathology, including diabetes (32), ischemic injury, and mechanical overload. It is conceivable that abnormal GCGR activity may impact on cellular metabolism and energetic status via AMPK-dependent modulation in working heart as shown by Sharma et al. (32). However, our understanding to noncanonical signaling mechanism of GCGR is still very limited, and more studies are needed to illustrate the mechanistic basis of GCGR antagonism–mediated cardioprotection in response to different pathological stressors and energy homeostasis in failing hearts.It is important to note that when REMD2.59 was applied 2 weeks after the onset of pressure overload, GCGR antagonism no longer had any significant impact on cardiac hypertrophy, but still preserved the residual functions of the heart (Figures 6 and 7). This is consistent with previously reported observation that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is established rather early in response to pressure overload while contractile dysfunction and fibrotic remodeling will continue to manifest (33). Our results highlight the potential limitation in the therapeutic window for heart failure. Nevertheless, REMD treatment can halt the further progression of heart failure and remodeling despite the limitation that GCGR antagonism may not be sufficient to reverse established cardiac hypertrophy and to fully restore contractile function. It is clear that more studies will be needed to fully establish the therapeutic efficacy of GCGR antagonism. Clinically relevant large animal models with established heart failure will be needed, and longer-term treatment and better outcome-based measurements (e.g., death and exercise tolerance) will be required.Extensive pharmacological and structural analysis shows GCGR antibody REMD-477 competitively blocks GLC binding to the GCGR with 30-pM binding affinity, and can fully inhibit the receptor activity at low nanomolar concentrations in cells (14,17,20). Functionally identical to REMD-477, REMD2.59 is a surrogate human antibody specifically generated for chronical preclinical studies in rodents and primates. Unlike previous small-molecule approaches (30), REMD-477 does not have deleterious effects on serum lipid profiles (11,12,19,21,31) in both ongoing clinical trials in diabetes patients. In short, the anti-GCGR antibody as tested here offers a novel and powerful therapeutic tool to effectively and specifically inhibit GCGR with proven record of clinical safety and efficacy at molecular and metabolic levels.Several other diabetic therapies, including GLC-like peptide-1 agonists (37,38), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibition (39), and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (40,41), have demonstrated various degrees of cardiovascular benefits along with ameliorated metabolic defects in glucose homeostasis. Yet, not all glucose-lowering therapies have such significant cardiovascular protective effects as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition (42–46). It is also unclear if these therapies will be efficacious for common forms of heart failure without the confounding metabolic disorders. Our current study in 2 heart failure disease models free from systemic metabolic disorders further supports that GCGR inhibition may be repurposed as an effective therapy for common forms of heart failure.Perspectives COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Systemic treatment of an antibody-based GCGR antagonist is currently in phase I and II clinical trials for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The current study demonstrates for the first time that systemic treatment of GCGR antagonist can also exert potent cardioprotection against ischemic injury in the heart, and prevents pathological remodeling and heart failure induced by mechanic overload in nonobese and nondiabetic mice.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Systemic treatment of GCGR antagonist can be considered as a potential therapy for heart failure with different etiologies without concurrent metabolic disorders.AcknowledgmentThe authors wish to thank Ms. Haiying Pu for excellent technical assistance.FootnotesThis work is supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants HL140116 to Dr. Wang.

Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 protects the left ventricle against this dysfunction. This study used a conductance catheter method to evaluate whether the right ventricle (RV) developed similar dysfunction during right coronary artery balloon occlusion and whether GLP-1 was protective. In this study, the RV underwent significant stunning and cumulative ischemic dysfunction with right coronary artery balloon occlusion. However, GLP-1 did not protect the RV against this dysfunction when infused after balloon occlusion.Key WordsThe importance of the right ventricle in the pathophysiology of heart disease is of increasing clinical relevance (1). Involvement of the right ventricle in myocardial infarction raises the risk of cardiogenic shock and increases mortality, even when treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (2). Pre-existing right ventricular (RV) failure portends poor prognosis in several conditions (3), and acute deterioration in RV function often has important hemodynamic and clinical consequences.The blood supply to the right ventricle depends on the coronary anatomy. In a right-dominant system (80%), the right coronary artery (RCA) supplies most of the right ventricle (4). The right ventricle is believed to be relatively resistant to ischemia compared with the left ventricle, as propelling blood into a low-resistance pulmonary circulation requires less work. The right ventricle has thinner, less muscular walls with a lower energetic demand and a lower nutrient/oxygen requirement as a result (5). Coronary balloon inflation during PCI provides a model of supply ischemia. Brief coronary balloon occlusion of the RCA reduces RV stroke volume and stroke work, while there is persistent deterioration of both systolic and diastolic function at 15 min after reperfusion (6,7). Studies of brief coronary occlusion on left ventricular (LV) function suggest that, after transient improvement resulting from reactive hyperemia, residual ventricular dysfunction is revealed (stunning) when coronary flow normalizes at some point after reperfusion (8).Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1is an incretin hormone, produced from L cells in response to food bolus. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists such as exenatide and liraglutide are used in the management of diabetes mellitus. Data from large trials have shown that these agents have cardiovascular benefits (9,10). Native GLP-1 has been shown to protect against stunning and cumulative ischemic dysfunction in the left ventricle, whether administered before or after balloon occlusion (11–13).Animal studies have found that GLP-1 protection against lethal ischemia-reperfusion in the left ventricle is dependent on intracellular signaling pathways involving p70s6K and the phosphoinositol-3-kinase–Akt complex (14–16). These signal cascades are important in the transduction of ischemic preconditioning, and the final effector is the mitochondrial potassium–adenosine triphosphate channel (m-KATP channel). However, blockade of the m-KATP channel, a final effector of ischemic preconditioning, did not abrogate GLP-1 protection in humans (13). Similarly, animal models have implicated changes in myocardial metabolism in GLP-1 cardioprotection (17–21), but a series of human studies have cast doubt on altered substrate use as the cause (12,22,23). A recent study found that GLP-1 is a coronary-specific vasodilator in humans but does not exert its ventricular effect by reducing systemic vascular tone. This study also confirmed that the GLP-1R was present on LV cardiomyocytes but was not expressed on vascular tissue, and thus GLP-1 is likely to have a direct ventricular effect, with secondary vasodilator effects mediated by ventricular–arterial cross-talk (24).The present study investigated whether RV dysfunction occurs during serial coronary balloon occlusion, assessed by using the gold standard conductance catheter technique (25–28), and whether it is ameliorated by GLP-1. These data will confirm whether GLP-1 cardioprotection is confined to the left ventricle or whether it offers protection from RV ischemia.MethodsStudy populationPatients with severe, dominant (providing the posterior descending artery) RCA disease awaiting single-vessel elective PCI, and with normal RV function assessed by echocardiography, were recruited. Patients were excluded if they had experienced a myocardial infarction in the preceding 3 months, had a pacemaker or significant valvular heart disease, or were not in sinus rhythm. All patients provided written informed consent before study inclusion.Patients were recruited in 2 blocks (control followed by GLP-1) to test the first hypothesis that serial balloon occlusion caused ischemic dysfunction, before testing whether GLP-1 infusion ameliorated the dysfunction. The study protocol was designed to match that used by Read et al. (11) to assess the effect of GLP-1 on the left ventricle. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (REC 14/EE/0141) and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02236299); the trial identification number was UKCRN14028.Pre-study protocolVariables that could alter coronary or ventricular hemodynamic variables were minimized. Patients were asked to abstain from consuming caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, as well as nicorandil and oral/sublingual nitrates, in the 24 h before the procedure. Patients were fasted for 6 h, received aspirin 300 mg and clopidogrel 300 mg before the procedure, and were anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin (70 to 100 IU/kg). An activated clotting time was maintained &gt;250 s throughout the procedure.Cardiac catheterizationFigure 1 depicts the study time line. A 6-F sheath was placed in the right radial artery and a 7-F sheath was placed in the right femoral vein under local anesthetic. Glyceryl trinitrate 100 μg was administered into the radial artery at the beginning of the procedure as standard to prevent radial spasm but not into the coronary arteries. Patients received 500 ml 0.9% saline administered intravenously before the procedure. No other infusions were administered during the procedure. A 6-F multipurpose catheter was positioned in the pulmonary artery and then the right atrium to measure mean pressures and obtain mixed venous blood gas saturations for determination of indirect Fick cardiac output. Blood was sampled to measure blood resistivity. A 7-F eight-electrode conductance catheter (Millar, Inc., Houston, Texas) was connected to an MPVS Ultra (Millar, Inc.) signal-conditioning unit in series with the PowerLab 16/30 (ADInstruments, New South Wales, Australia) 16-channel amplifier. The conductance catheter was submersed in a saline bath and the pressure transducer zeroed before insertion through the venous sheath and positioning it apically along the long axis of the right ventricle under fluoroscopic guidance (Figure 2A). The conductance catheter was calibrated by using the technique first described in the left ventricle by Baan et al. (29) that has subsequently been used for the right ventricle (30,31).Figure 1 Study Time LineBlood samples taken before baseline (BL1) and at 30-min recovery (BL2). BO1 = first balloon occlusion; BO2 = second balloon occlusion; GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide 1.Figure 2 Example of Data Acquisition(A) Fluoroscopic image of the conductance catheter located in the right ventricle during low-pressure balloon occlusion of the right coronary artery. (B) Right ventricular (RV) pressure–volume loops recorded at baseline (blue), at the end of the low-pressure balloon occlusion (red), and at 15-min recovery (green).Pressure–volume loop data acquisitionThe conductance technique was used to measure the pressure–volume (PV) loop relationship during mid-expiration breath hold, providing beat-to-beat assessment of RV function at steady state for at least 5 cardiac cycles. PV loop data were recorded at baseline (BL1), the end of a 1-min low-pressure (&lt;4 atm) balloon occlusion (BO1), and at 1-min recovery. The study infusion was then immediately commenced. PV loop data were acquired after 30-min recovery and at the end of a further 1-min balloon occlusion (BO2). Once data collection was completed, PCI was performed at operator discretion. An example of PV loops generated from the right ventricle during balloon occlusion is shown in Figure 2B.Offline RV hemodynamic measurementsConductance catheter data were analyzed offline by using LabChart software (LabChart 7.0, ADInstruments). Five steady-state PV loops were recorded at each time point, generating load-dependent parameters of systolic and diastolic function. Systolic parameters of ventricular function were cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke work, ejection fraction, end-systolic pressure, and the maximum rate of isovolumic contraction (dP/dtmax). Effective arterial elastance to assess afterload was also assessed. Diastolic parameters of ventricular function were end-diastolic pressure (EDP), the maximum rate of isovolumic relaxation (dP/dtmin), and the time constant of diastolic relaxation (Tau) (32–34). Tau represents the exponential decay of the RV pressure during isovolumic relaxation and was determined by using the Weiss method. Tau is considered load dependent but is predominantly affected by heart rate.Study infusionsInfusion of GLP-1 (7 to 36) amide acetate (or 0.9% saline solution at matched rate) at 1.2 pmol/kg/min was administered after the first balloon occlusion (BO1) until completion of the PV loop measurement (after BO2). This infusion was at the same dose as that administered in previous studies which reduced ischemic dysfunction in the left ventricle (11–13).BiochemistryBaseline peripheral venous blood samples to measure glucose, insulin, GLP-1 (7 to 36) amide, and free fatty acids were obtained at the beginning of the case. Additional peripheral venous blood samples were drawn before the second balloon occlusion. Blood for GLP-1 assays was drawn up into pre-prepared 2-ml syringes containing 20 μl of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (Merck Millipore, Nottingham, United Kingdom). These syringes were chilled before collection, and the blood sample was immediately transferred to 2.5-ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes, which had also been prepared, containing the protease inhibitor aprotinin (Trasylol, Nordic Group, Trondheim, Norway). These samples were kept in crushed ice until they were spun and stored at −20°C. Samples for insulin and free fatty acids were also collected. Blood samples were collected into lithium-heparin tubes, which were also stored on crushed ice before centrifugation and storage at −20°C. All samples were spun within 1 h of collection.ImmunohistochemistryHuman tissue samples from anonymous donors were stained for the GLP-1R to correlate our clinical findings with immunohistochemistry. LV and RV samples from nondiabetic patients with ischemic heart disease were stained. Tissue samples from the Royal Papworth Hospital Tissue Bank were stained for the presence of the GLP-1R. Tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for a minimum of 24 h before dehydration and paraffin embedding. Pancreas was used as a positive control and also stained with hematoxylin-eosin to identify the beta cells. Matched tissue samples from left and right ventricles underwent immunohistochemical analysis using the mAb 3F52 GLP-1R antibody. This receptor was sourced from the University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB); monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3F52 was deposited to the DSHB by Knudsen, L.B. (DSHB Hybridoma Product mAb 3F52). It has previously been validated as specific for the GLP-1R to map GLP-1R expression (35).Statistical analysisData are expressed as mean ± SD unless otherwise stated. Analysis was performed by using SPSS version 25 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York). The sample sizes used in the present analysis had the power to detect differences between treatment and placebo groups as estimated by previous research (11). A minimum of 11 patients per group was needed to achieve 80% power. Permission to recruit 15 patients in each group was obtained, ensuring that the study could be completed if datasets were incomplete. Comparison within the groups used a paired Student's t-test. For comparisons between groups, nonparametric data were compared by using a Mann-Whitney U test, whereas normally distributed data used an unpaired Student's t-test. Categorical data were compared with the Fisher exact test. The p values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsA total of 27 patients were recruited to the study. Three patients were withdrawn from subsequent analysis for technical reasons. Patient demographic data are summarized in Table 1. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups, although patients in the GLP-1 group trended toward having increased mean pulmonary artery pressure compared with the control group. Baseline hemodynamic data were broadly similar between groups. However, there was a trend toward increased Tau (p = 0.06) and reduced stroke work (p = 0.06) in the GLP-1 group.Table 1 Demographic and Hemodynamic DataEffect of repeated coronary balloon occlusion on RV functionOcclusion of the RCA was associated with deterioration of systolic and diastolic function compared with baseline (BL1). At the end of the first balloon occlusion (BO1), stroke volume, ejection fraction, and dP/dtmax were significantly reduced, with Tau and EDP increased (Table 2). Systolic function improved modestly after 1 min of reperfusion, and only dP/dtmax improved to above baseline function. Similarly, there were modest improvements in diastolic function at the 1-min recovery, but Tau was still significantly impaired compared with baseline. At 30-min recovery (BL2), there was numerical improvement compared with BO1 in most measures of systolic and diastolic function, with stroke volume (p = 0.08), dP/dtmax (p = 0.07), and dP/dtmin (p = 0.09) trending toward improvement, and a statistically significant improvement in Tau (p &lt; 0.01). Nonetheless, most measures remained impaired compared with BL1 (cardiac output, stroke work, ejection fraction, dP/dtmax, dP/dtmin, EDP, and Tau), suggesting that there was stunning of the right ventricle at the 30-min recovery. Further balloon occlusion (BO2) was associated with impairment of the right ventricle, but only dP/dtmax (p = 0.01) showed significant impairment of function compared with BO1, consistent with cumulative ischemic RV dysfunction.Table 2 RV Hemodynamic Data at All Study Time PointsEffect of GLP-1 on RV function during balloon occlusionThe change in parameters of RV function in the GLP-1 group was similar to those of the saline control group, with systolic and diastolic dysfunction after BO1 (before starting the GLP-1 infusion), stunning, and cumulative ischemic RV dysfunction observed (Table 2). There was no significant difference in any marker of systolic or diastolic function between the saline and GLP-1 groups at either 30-min recovery or the second balloon occlusion (Figure 3).Figure 3 Serial RV Hemodynamic DataBO1 caused significant reduction in the (A) maximum rate of isovolumic contraction (dP/dtmax) and (B) stroke volume (SV) and (C) increases in end-diastolic pressure (EDP) and (D) the time constant of diastolic relaxation (Tau). *p &lt; 0.05 versus BL1.

GLP-1 was metabolically active, causing a significant rise in insulin levels and a fall in plasma glucose levels. There was a small, but significant, drop in insulin levels in the control group. This reduction may represent the fasted nature of the cohort. However, there were no hypoglycemic episodes recorded during the study. Plasma free fatty acids rose in both groups as a result of the administration of unfractionated heparin required for the procedure (36), but there were no significant differences in free fatty acid levels between the groups.Figure 4 Serial Biochemical DataComparison of change in plasma levels of (A) GLP-1 (7 to 36) amide, (B) glucose, (C) insulin, and (D) free fatty acids (FFA).

Scale is 100 μm in all images.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge this study is the first, to assess the effect of GLP-1 on RV function using the conductance technique in humans during supply ischemia precipitated by repeat coronary balloon occlusion. RCA occlusion was associated with marked deterioration in systolic and diastolic measures of RV function. There was rapid RV recovery of some indices at 1 min, although residual stunning was observed at 30 min. Further occlusion was associated with cumulative RV dysfunction in some indices. GLP-1 did not abrogate myocardial stunning or ischemic RV dysfunction.Ischemic LV dysfunction and stunning after transient coronary balloon occlusion have been reported previously by our group (11–13). Transient supra-baseline improvement in systolic performance occurs during early reperfusion due to reactive hyperemia, causing increased coronary flow that augments LV function through a phenomenon known as the Gregg effect (37). Increased volume of the microvasculature after reperfusion causes stretch-activated calcium channels to open. The resultant influx of calcium increases myocyte contractility and briefly masks the effect of ischemic LV dysfunction, despite the presence of stunning (38). Stunning is revealed when the reactive hyperemia subsides.In the present study, the magnitude of the effect of coronary balloon occlusion and reperfusion on RV function was blunted compared with studies investigating the left ventricle. This difference may be explained by: 1) the comparatively low myocardial mass of the right ventricle; 2) reduced ischemic burden during RCA occlusion; 3) the conduit nature of the right ventricle as a volume pump; and 4) because up to 50% of RV function is derived from the left ventricle, through a shared septum and ventricular interdependence. Nevertheless, in contrast to previous studies (6), we assessed the prolonged recovery of the right ventricle from transient supply ischemia. We confirmed that, like the left ventricle, when reactive hyperemia subsides, RV stunning is discernible and cumulative RV dysfunction can be observed.GLP-1 abrogates LV stunning and cumulative ischemic dysfunction during both supply (coronary artery occlusion) and demand (dobutamine stress) ischemia, in a consistent manner (11,13,39). The absence of a cardioprotective effect in the right ventricle is surprising, particularly as we have confirmed that GLP-1 levels were significantly augmented in our study and that the GLP-1R is expressed on RV myocytes. This finding is consistent with other recently published data showing the presence of GLP-1R messenger ribonucleic acid in all 4 chambers of the heart (40). The absence of protective effect may again be explained by the reduced mass of the right ventricle. Although GLP-1 still binds to cardiomyocytes in the right ventricle, the effect size could be too small to be detected clinically by the conductance catheter. Furthermore, the reduced myocardial mass of the right ventricle may prevent the detection of cardioprotection by GLP-1 in this thinner walled ventricle. The GLP-1R appears to be expressed in the same density as in the left ventricle, although we have not been able to accurately quantify receptor density for comparison in this study. It is possible that although GLP-1 binds the receptor in the right ventricle, this action does not affect the RV cardiomyocytes in the same fashion as in the left ventricle. The presence of persistent RV impairment after PCI to the RCA is pertinent to clinical practice.Our findings may be especially relevant in patients with limited RV functional reserve, in whom hemodynamic instability after PCI is a particular risk. Minimizing the duration of coronary balloon occlusion during PCI in this subset of patients could reduce the risk of hemodynamic compromise. From a translational perspective, GLP-1 and GLP-1R agonists remain potential therapeutic agents for those with acute hemodynamic disturbance related to myocardial ischemia. Pilot studies have shown that GLP-1R agonists reduce the need for inotropic support for critically ill patients (41,42). However, our data suggest that, although GLP-1 may be a possible therapy for ischemic LV dysfunction, GLP-1 is not likely to be a useful therapy for reducing ischemic RV dysfunction.Study limitationsThe 30-min recovery period was chosen for ethical and practical reasons. Longer follow-up to show that parameters eventually returned to baseline values would be desirable to confirm the reversible nature of RV stunning. Similarly, we did not directly confirm coronary flow normalization required to fulfill the definition of stunning. However, we and others have confirmed recovery of basal flow velocity within this time frame in the left coronary artery (8). The myocardial bed subtended by the RCA is smaller, and therefore, a priori, the ischemic insult after RCA occlusion is less and subsequent reactive hyperemia in response shorter than that seen after left coronary artery occlusion. Despite recruiting patients with proximal stenoses in dominant RCAs, we did not confirm the degree of ischemic insult by using another modality (e.g., serum lactate). It is possible that the 2 groups had different ischemic burdens that masked any difference being observed in the GLP-1 group.The right ventricle is a challenging chamber to assess in all imaging modalities. For RV conductance studies, its thin wall increases parallel conductance, whereas its eccentric shape means that volume assessment is less amenable to simple geometric modeling than the conical left ventricle. Nonetheless, a number of studies have shown that RV conductance studies provide accurate assessment of the right ventricle (6,26,27).Patients in the present study were not randomized to treatment. However, all eligible patients were consecutively recruited into the study from the elective PCI waiting list compiled independently from the clinicians involved in the study. The endpoint data were objective empiric hemodynamic data and not influenced by knowledge of the allocation and techniques employed were familiar to the operators, minimizing the risk of a ""learning curve"" on the results. GLP-1 protects against ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. There was a nonsignificant difference in the baseline characteristics of the 2 groups that was unexpected and may have disadvantaged the GLP-1 group and prevented small improvements in RV dysfunction being observed after GLP-1 compared with control subjects. However, patients also acted as their own control with serial BO, and we believe a neutral effect of GLP-1 on the right ventricle is likely.ConclusionsStunning and cumulative ischemic RV dysfunction was observed after RCA balloon occlusion in human subjects. This scenario may contribute to hemodynamic instability in patients with limited RV reserve. GLP-1 infusion did not attenuate this ischemic RV dysfunction.Perspectives COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Animal studies have shown that GLP-1 protects against lethal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Human studies have shown that GLP-1 protects against ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. This translational study found that stunning and cumulative dysfunction occur in the right ventricle but that GLP-1 does not abrogate this action. These findings may be of clinical relevance to a subset of patients with limited RV reserve during PCI.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Additional research is needed to address the mechanisms behind GLP-1 cardioprotection in the left ventricle and whether GLP-1 also protects against lethal ischemia-reperfusion injury in humans.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank the staff in the cardiac catheter laboratory at Royal Papworth Hospital for their assistance and thank the patients for participating in this study.FootnotesThis study was supported by a National Institute for Health Research Healthcare Scientist Doctoral Fellowship Grant (NIHR-HCS-D12-14).

How Do They Work?,"Insulin and glucagon are hormones that help regulate the levels of blood glucose, or sugar, in your body. Glucose, which comes from the food you eat, moves through your bloodstream to help fuel your body. Insulin and glucagon work together to balance your blood sugar levels, keeping them in the narrow range that your body requires. These hormones are like the yin and yang of blood glucose maintenance. Read on to learn more about how they function and what can happen when they don't work well.Insulin and glucagon work in what's called a negative feedback loop. During this process, one event triggers another, which triggers another, and so on, to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. How insulin works During digestion, foods that contain carbohydrates are converted into glucose. Most of this glucose is sent into your bloodstream, causing a rise in blood glucose levels. This increase in blood glucose signals your pancreas to produce insulin. The insulin tells cells throughout your body to take in glucose from your bloodstream. As the glucose moves into your cells, your blood glucose levels go down. Some cells use the glucose as energy. Other cells, such as in your liver and muscles, store any excess glucose as a substance called glycogen. Your body uses glycogen for fuel between meals. Read more: Simple vs. complex carbs »How glucagon works Glucagon works to counterbalance the actions of insulin.About four to six hours after you eat, the glucose levels in your blood decrease, triggering your pancreas to produce glucagon. This hormone signals your liver and muscle cells to change the stored glycogen back into glucose. These cells then release the glucose into your bloodstream so your other cells can use it for energy. This whole feedback loop with insulin and glucagon is constantly in motion. It keeps your blood sugar levels from dipping too low, ensuring that your body has a steady supply of energy.Your body's regulation of blood glucose is an amazing metabolic feat. However, for some people, the process doesn't work properly. Diabetes mellitus is the best known condition that causes problems with blood sugar balance. Diabetes refers to a group of diseases. If you have diabetes or prediabetes, your body's use or production of insulin and glucagon are off. And when the system is thrown out of balance, it can lead to dangerous levels of glucose in your blood.Type 1 diabetesOf the two main types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes is the less common form. It's thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system destroys the cells that make insulin in your pancreas. If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas doesn't produce insulin. As a result, you must take insulin every day. If you don't, you'll get very sick or you could die. For more information, read about the complications of type 1 diabetes.Learn more: Everything you need to know about insulin »Type 2 diabetesWith type 2 diabetes, your body makes insulin but your cells don't respond to it normally. They don't take in glucose from your bloodstream as well as they once did, which leads to higher blood sugar levels. Over time, type 2 diabetes makes your body produce less insulin, which further raises your blood sugar levels. Gestational diabetesSome women develop gestational diabetes late in their pregnancies. In gestational diabetes, pregnancy-related hormones may interfere with how insulin works. This condition normally disappears after the pregnancy ends. However, if you've had gestational diabetes, you're at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future.PrediabetesIf you have prediabetes, your body makes insulin but doesn't use it properly. As a result, your blood glucose levels are raised, though not as high as they would be if you had type 2 diabetes. Many people who have prediabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes. Knowing how your body works can help you stay healthy. Insulin and glucagon are two critical hormones your body makes to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. It's helpful to understand how these hormones function so you can work to avoid diabetes. If you have more questions about insulin, glucagon, and blood glucose, talk to your doctor. Questions you have might include:Is my blood glucose at a safe level?Do I have prediabetes?What can I do to avoid developing diabetes?How do I know if I need to take insulin?",https://t.co/DnV7AxLU30,others
A Closer Look at Glucagon,"""Contrary to popular belief, insulin is not needed for glucose uptake and utilization in man.""(Manninen, 2004)In a world where we learn the primary function of insulin is to facilitate cellular glucose uptake, the statement above is nothing short of revolutionary. Indeed, though, as the author goes on to say:""Contrary to popular belief supported by the leading physiology and biochemistry textbooks, there is sufficient population of glucose transporters in all cell membranes at all times to ensure enough glucose uptake to satisfy the cell's respiration, even in the absence of insulin. Insulin can and does increase the number of these transporters in some cells but glucose uptake is never truly insulin dependent.""This might shock many people, especially those living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. But it's true: most glucose transporters do not require insulin to take glucose into cells. GLUT4, the most abundant glucose transporter in adipose tissue, skeletal and cardiac muscles, is insulin-sensitive and its translocation to the cell membrane is stimulated by insulin, but it can also participate in non-insulin mediated glucose uptake, such as during physical activity. (In fact, exercise is the most potent stimulus for increased skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression.) So why, then, do most people—including many medical and nutrition professionals—think of insulin primarily as a ""blood sugar hormone?""There's no doubt that insulin does play a primary role in regulating blood glucose, but not for the reason we usually think. As mentioned, glucose uptake in the body is never truly dependent on insulin. The main role of insulin in gluco-regulation may be to counteract the effects of glucagon. And with about 88% of people surveyed last year meeting criteria for being ""metabolically unhealthy,"" and most of this stemming from metabolic syndrome or chronically high insulin, there's a good reason insulin and insulin resistance garner the lion's share of health headlines. But what about glucagon, an insulin counter-regulatory hormone?Glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells in the pancreas, and it has opposite effects to those of insulin: whereas insulin inhibits lipolysis and ketogeniesis (the breakdown of fats and generation of ketones, respectively), glucagon stimulates these. Insulin is anti-catabolic; glucagon is catabolic. We can see this in the way individuals with untreated type 1 diabetes (T1D) waste away: this is the effect of glucagon run amok when insulin is absent or insufficient for keeping it in check. As Dr. Roger Unger, an expert in this field, wrote: ""the catabolic actions heretofore considered the direct consequences of insulin lack are actually mediated by a relative or absolute excess of glucagon to insulin.""Whereas insulin lowers blood glucose (BG) in the postprandial or fed state, glucagon raises BG in the fasted state, whether that means during a long term fast or simply overnight or for long spans between meals when food hasn't been consumed for several hours. It does this by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. It can also catabolize muscle proteins to generate glucose from amino acids, which explains the wasting seen in untreated T1D. Hyperglycemia—particularly in the case of T1D but also possibly in individuals with insulin resistance—does not necessarily result from an inability of cells to take up glucose, but rather, from uncontrolled hepatic production and release of glucose: ""The use of tracer glucose infusions has shown not only that hyperglycaemia in the face of insulin deficiency is the result of over-production of glucose by the liver but also that insulin infusion lowers blood glucose by inhibiting hepatic glucose production.""A paper published after the one cited above corroborates:""When insulin is administered to people with diabetes who are fasting, blood glucose concentrations falls. It is generally assumed that this is because insulin increases glucose uptake into tissues. However, this is not the case and is just another metabolic legend arising from in vitro rat data. It has been shown that insulin at concentrations that are within the normal physiological range lowers blood glucose through inhibiting hepatic glucose production."" (Manninen, 2004)Hyperglycemia, or even a normal rise in BG such as occurs after a meal, normally elicits an increase in insulin in order to lower the BG, and the presence of insulin suppresses glucagon secretion. When insulin is absent, however, as in T1D, or when pancreatic alpha cells are not responding to insulin properly (as may occur in T2D), the elevation of BG stimulates glucagon secretion: ""This adds an endogenous source of glucose to the exogenous glucose from the meal."" No wonder BG is so high postprandially in those with T1 or T2D—even higher than would be expected solely from the carbohydrate content of a meal.Beyond control of BG, stimulating lipolysis and ketogenesis, and inhibiting fatty acid synthesis, glucagon crosses the blood-brain barrier and appears to regulate appetite and satiety via effects in the central nervous system. (Evidence indicates a small amount of glucagon synthesis occurs within the brain stem as well, and some is also produced in the eneteroendocrine L-cells of the intestinal mucosa.) It has also been shown to enhance metabolic rate through activation of brown adipose tissue and inducing a thermogenic effect. For these reasons, glucagon action is an attractive target for drugs and other therapies intended for fat loss. Some overlaps between glucagon and GLP-1 action may explain the modest weight loss observed in people with or without T2D treated with GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs. Individuals on low-carb or ketogenic diets sometimes fear the glucose-raising effects of glucagon. However, gluconeogenesis (GNG) in the context of a low-carb or ketogenic diet is different from that which occurs on a high-carb diet or, more specifically, when hepatic glycogen is full: ""The hyperglycemic property of glucagon is further enhanced when hepatic glycogen levels are high and diminished when glycogen levels are low, such as in fasted animals, diabetic animals with ketosis, or patients with liver cirrhosis.""Of course, one need not fast, nor have diabetes or cirrhosis in order for hepatic glycogen to be low. This occurs naturally on low-carb or ketogenic diets, and since the body and brain always need some glucose, even on a strict ketogenic diet, keto dieters can thank glucagon for keeping them alive and helping their brain fire on all cylinders. In the context of a low-carb or keto diet, GNG doesn't typically cause hyperglycemia; it merely maintains BG within a healthy range, preventing it from falling to dangerously low levels. People following low-carb diets for fat loss or blood glucose control need not fear glucagon-induced GNG causing chronically elevated BG and the undesirable metabolic sequelae that would result. The context of glucose appearing in the blood is entirely different than on a high-carb diet with hepatic glycogen fully replete. (Ben Bikman, PhD, a researcher focused on insulin and well known in the ketogenic community, gave an informative talk on this topic in 2018: Insulin vs. Glucagon: The relevance of dietary protein.)Glucagon is a fascinating hormone with powerful influences on several areas of interest, including types 1 and 2 diabetes, fat loss, appetite regulation and more.
